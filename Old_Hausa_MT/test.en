Lot’s ‘ sons - in - law were to take his daughters , ’ yet the Bible does not tell us why or how the engagements came about .
Though Jacob spoke of Rachel as “ my wife , ” they had no sexual relations during those years .
Upon meeting Saul’s demand , David could marry the daughter , Michal .
Usually these were blood relatives , but some engagements and marriages were prohibited because of inheritance rights .
Still , he did not minimize the seriousness of marriage , nor that of engagement .
A Christian should not rush into courtship , engagement , or marriage .
We publish Bible - based material that can help single individuals to decide whether it is wise to commence a courtship or to take steps toward engagement or marriage .
Can I envision serving God with that one for a lifetime ?
Have we been adequately exposed to each other’s personality traits ?
Once two Christians are betrothed , it is right for them and for others to expect that marriage will follow .
Christians who get engaged should mean it .
Perhaps the two will discuss the matter thoroughly and agree to continue their engagement .
On the other hand , the one learning of the serious issue may personally feel compelled to end the engagement , even if the other person wants it to continue . ​ — See “ Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower of June 15 , 1975 .
He did not say that a legal marriage can be ended by divorce if one learns of a grave problem or wrongdoing that preceded the wedding .
Granted , such sad situations are rare , but these examples should add emphasis to the basic point : Engagement is not to be taken lightly .
In some societies parents still arrange for the betrothal of their children .
Peter insisted : “ Even if all the others are stumbled , yet I will not be . ”
Later , while Jesus was being interrogated in the house of High Priest Caiaphas , Peter lingered anxiously in the courtyard .
Three times he disavowed his connection with Jesus .
( b ) What should be our determination ?
That was a low point in Peter’s life , a moment he no doubt regretted for the rest of his days .
Most of us would likely agree that Paul’s words do not apply to Peter .
We can be assured that such momentary lapses do not make us the sort that shrink back to destruction .
Yet , neither of these faithful prophets nor the apostle Peter could rightly be described as the sort that shrink back .
This definition fits the context .
A master of “ crafty acts , ” he knows that such a ruinous course often starts in small ways .
The evidence indicates that Paul wrote his letter to the Hebrews about 61 C.E .
A period of peace ensued , however , allowing the number of Christians to multiply .
As the years passed , other persecutions and hardships came and went .
It seems that by the time Paul wrote the letter to the Hebrews , the congregation was once again enjoying a period of comparative peace .
Nearly three decades had passed since Jesus had foretold the destruction of Jerusalem .
They may , in effect , have said : ‘ We have the great temple in Jerusalem , standing for centuries !
We have a noble high priest officiating there , along with his underpriests .
( a ) What theme pervades the letter to the Hebrews ?
The first ​ — the superiority of the Christian system of worship — ​ pervades the letter to the Hebrews .
Throughout his letter , Paul developed this theme .
10 , 11 . ( a ) Why did Jesus ’ lineage not disqualify his serving as High Priest in the spiritual temple ?
Rather , he was a High Priest “ according to the manner of Melchizedek . ”
Furthermore , unlike the high priest at the temple in Jerusalem , Jesus did not have to offer sacrifices year after year .
Heartwarming , too , are Paul’s comments showing that this High Priest is the same unchanging Jesus whom the Christians in Jerusalem had known .
Those anointed Christians had the prospect of serving as Christ’s underpriests !
How could they even think of shrinking back to “ the weak and beggarly ” things of corrupt Judaism ? ​ — Galatians 4 : 9 .
As if that were not enough , Paul gave the Hebrews a second reason never to shrink back to destruction ​ — their own record of endurance .
Yes , they had shown exemplary faith and perseverance .
Yet , why did Paul ask them to “ keep on remembering ” such painful experiences ?
What a powerful reason Paul gave the Hebrew Christians for never pursuing such a course !
As foretold , though , such gifts eventually ceased . ​ — 1 Corinthians 13 : 8 .
* Thus , we have seen the restoration of God’s arrangement for pure worship .
By the end of the first century , when the aged apostle John was acting as the final restraint against corruption , apostasy was already flourishing .
How discouraging for faithful Christians !
Only Jehovah , with his Son as Head of the congregation , could protect His people from corruption during these corrupt times .
All of us have endured , continuing in our faithful service to Jehovah despite life’s challenges and tests .
What will be discussed in our next article ?
Our next article will consider this matter .
[ Footnote ]
See The Watchtower , March 1 , 1999 , pages 8 - 23 .
□ What reasons for not shrinking back to destruction did Paul give the Hebrews ?
Think of the many ways in which they show faith .
You may see elderly ones who have served God for decades , youths who daily stand up to peer pressure , and parents who work hard to raise God - fearing children .
Rather , he included himself with them .
How could Paul have such confidence ?
It was solidly based and Scripturally founded .
Fitting Use of God’s Word
From what source was Paul quoting when he wrote the words recorded at Hebrews 10 : 38 ?
In vision , the prophet saw the Chaldeans ( or , Babylonians ) , a “ nation bitter and impetuous , ” swooping down on Judah and destroying Jerusalem , swallowing up peoples and nations in the process .
It is no wonder that the anguished prophet Habakkuk cried out : “ How long , O Jehovah ? ” ​ — Habakkuk 1 : 2 .
Habakkuk did not know how close the destruction of Jerusalem was .
Similarly , the first - century Christians did not know when the Jewish system of things would end .
Let us note , then , Jehovah’s twofold answer to Habakkuk .
How did obedient servants of Jehovah keep living by their faithfulness ( a ) in 607 B.C.E . ?
When Jerusalem was sacked in 607 B.C.E . , Jeremiah , his secretary Baruch , Ebed - melech , and the loyal Rechabites saw the truth of Jehovah’s promise to Habakkuk .
Jehovah rewarded their faithfulness .
How did Paul describe Moses ’ faith , and how might we imitate Moses in this regard ?
As you read Hebrews chapter 11 , note how he brings the examples of Bible characters to life .
So Enoch did not get to see the fulfillment of the prophecy he uttered .
However , he received a gift that was , in some respects , even better . ​ — Hebrews 11 : 5 ; Genesis 5 : 22 - 24 .
What did this mean ?
Before he went into the sleep of death , Enoch may have had a vision of some kind , perhaps of the earthly Paradise in which he will awaken one day soon .
In any case , Jehovah let Enoch know that He was well pleased by his faithful course .
( Compare Proverbs 27 : 11 . )
Be determined to live by faith , day by day .
Rather , Paul describes meetings as opportunities to get to know one another , to move one another to serve God more fully , and to encourage one another .
Why did Paul urge the Hebrew Christians to hold fast to their ministry , and why is the same counsel appropriate today ?
Satan was certainly pressuring those Hebrew Christians to let go of their ministry , and he is pressuring God’s people today as well .
( b ) What measures should we take if we find ourselves intimidated by some aspect of our Christian ministry ?
No , he “ mustered up boldness . ”
From within ?
No , he said that he mustered up boldness “ by means of our God . ”
For example , arrange to work with someone who is adept at the form of witnessing that concerns you .
If so , observe and learn .
What blessings may we experience if we muster up boldness in our ministry ?
What precious reward is in store for “ the sort that have faith ” ?
You can do so by building yourself and others up through adept use of God’s Word , by studying Bible examples of faith and bringing them to life , by preparing for and participating in Christian meetings , and by holding fast to the precious privilege of the public ministry .
Paul quoted the Septuagint rendering of Habakkuk 2 : 4 , which includes the phrase “ if anyone shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him . ”
How Would You Answer ?
□ What Scriptural examples of faith did Paul bring to life ?
After his painful experience in Philippi , Paul mustered up boldness to continue preaching
Faith Can Change Your Life
One day , John heard his young nephew talking about Paradise .
Little by little , John and Tania developed a Bible - based faith that changed their lives .
She had a child , but her husband was much older than she was .
When the Witness learned of the situation , she explained what the Bible says about marriage ​ — for example , that marriage is a gift from God and not something to be thrown away lightly .
A sad statistic affecting family life has to do with abortion .
Months later , she explained why .
However , the picture of the unborn baby on page 24 of the brochure touched the woman’s heart .
The accompanying Bible - based explanation that life is sacred because ‘ with God is the source of life ’ persuaded her to keep her baby .
The Witness gave them , not money , but something better .
Is a Bible - based faith strong enough to change the lives of such youngsters ?
Alex saw many of his companions killed , but he survived .
As his faith began to grow , he followed the Bible command : “ Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good ; let him seek peace and pursue it . ” ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 11 .
The Right Kind of Faith
These are just a few of the many , many examples that could be cited to illustrate the power of genuine faith based on the Bible .
Of course , not everyone who merely claims to believe in God lives up to the Bible’s high standards .
Indeed , some atheists may live better lives than some professed Christians .
The power of God’s Word helped each individual to build the strong faith that changed his life for the better .
Happy , united humans will enjoy peace and prosperity for all eternity .
Christ Jesus is the superlative example of a courageous witness .
Jesus declared : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . ”
Babylonian Sectarianism
How did Babylon the Great come to be ?
Nimrod’s greatest city , Babylon ( Babel ) , became a center of demonistic religion .
Thus Babylon became the source of a worldwide empire of false religion , named Babylon the Great in the book of Revelation .
Sure enough , in 539 B.C.E . , the prophetic declaration came true .
Some were ensnared by Greek philosophy .
By the time Jesus was born , the nation had again turned away from pure worship .
Just as Paul had warned , what developments led to the existence of Christendom ?
Would the witness to pure worship and to Jehovah vanish from the earth ?
In the latter part of the 19th century , in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , U.S.A . , a group of sincere Bible students was organized and became the nucleus of God’s modern - day witness class .
True to Bible prophecy , this world’s “ conclusion ” began in 1914 and was marked by the outbreak of the first world war .
Responsible officers of the Society were imprisoned , falsely charged with sedition , as Jesus had been in the first century .
A “ Lookout ” on the Watch
( a ) What message has Jehovah’s watchman proclaimed ?
Again , Jehovah’s watchman , his witness class , announced : “ She has fallen !
* Faithfully , for 120 years The Watchtower has kept watch on world events and their prophetic import .
Well , from the first issue of 6,000 copies in 1879 , The Watchtower has grown to a worldwide circulation of more than 22,000,000 copies in 132 languages ​ — 121 of these being published simultaneously .
A Progressive Cleansing
( b ) What is the correct explanation of the “ altar ” and the “ pillar ” in “ Egypt ” ?
It was thought that this memorial of Pharaoh Khufu was the pillar referred to at Isaiah 19 : 19 , 20 : “ In that day there will prove to be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to Jehovah beside its boundary .
Some Bible Students became engrossed with measuring different features of the pyramid to determine such matters as the day they would be going to heaven !
As the years pass , Jehovah continues to give us further clarification of truth , including a clearer understanding of his prophetic word .
In recent years , we have been encouraged to look again with deeper understanding at ​ — among other things — ​ the generation that will not pass away before the end comes , the parable of the sheep and the goats , the disgusting thing and when it will stand in a holy place , the new covenant , the transfiguration , and the temple vision of the book of Ezekiel .
• What is the origin of Babylon the Great ?
“ DARKNESS itself will cover the earth , and thick gloom the national groups ; but upon you Jehovah will shine forth , and upon you his own glory will be seen . ”
Most people live in spiritual darkness .
Still , light does shine today .
They increased in number to tens of thousands as Jehovah fulfilled his promise : “ I shall without fail collect the remaining ones of Israel together . In unity I shall set them , like a flock in the pen , like a drove in the midst of its pasture ; they will be noisy with men . ”
Would Jehovah shine forth on only the remaining ones of the “ little flock ” ?
This gathering work is alluded to in Isaiah’s prophecy when it says : “ Nations will certainly go to your light , and kings to the brightness of your shining forth . ”
Jehovah’s Zealous Servants
What a wonderful record of zealous service !
Last January , the Governing Body announced an adjustment in the hour requirement for pioneers .
Ghana reports : “ Since the new pioneer hour goal went into effect , the ranks of our regular pioneers have steadily gone up . ”
“ Every Good Work ”
And volunteers are involved in such projects as building Kingdom Halls ​ — a work that also gives a witness .
Regional Building Committees used their skills to rebuild houses .
People like you should be in all parts of the world . ”
Despite the dwindling number of the anointed , why is Jehovah’s name being declared as never before ?
First to respond to Jehovah’s ‘ shining forth ’ were his “ sons , ” anointed Christians .
Hundreds of thousands are added each year , and the way is open for yet more .
Last year 323,439 were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah , and he has not yet closed the gates .
“ The desirable things of all the nations , ” members of the great crowd , are still crowding through them .
May all such ones never lose their appreciation for the light !
Even Jesus , “ the true light that gives light to every sort of man , ” was ridiculed , opposed , and finally killed by his countrymen .
What has resulted from discreetly presenting facts concerning our work to the media ?
As a result , Jehovah’s name has been widely published in newspapers and magazines and on radio and television .
Afterward , a lady who had seen the program commented : “ It was so clear who had the spirit of God . ”
To their chagrin , opposers will soon have to recognize that they have , in effect , been fighting against God himself .
Yes , Jehovah is the Savior of his people .
For example , wise use of computer and communications technology facilitates the simultaneous publication of The Watchtower in 121 languages and Awake !
16 , 17 . ( a ) Although difficult , why is it vital to maintain Jehovah’s high standards ?
In Suriname , a 14 - year - old girl was approached by a good - looking boy at school and invited to have sexual relations .
She refused , explaining that the Bible forbids such things outside marriage .
Other girls at school mocked her and tried to pressure her to change her mind , saying that everyone wanted to sleep with that particular boy .
The girl was happy that she had obeyed Jehovah’s command to ‘ abstain from fornication . ’
Jehovah’s Witnesses are very proud of the young ones among them who stand firm for what is right .
Jehovah Has Given the Increase
Yes , Jehovah sheds light on his people , blessing them , guiding them , and strengthening them .
Last year 14,088,751 attended the celebration of the Memorial of Jesus ’ death .
Jehovah still shines brightly upon his people .
• Despite fierce opposition , of what are we confident ?

“ Keep on the watch , therefore , because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming . ” ​ — MATTHEW 24 : 42 .
Macmillan , who after over six decades of dedicated service to God , said : “ I am more determined than ever to keep on in my faith .
In this regard , what examples do we find in the Bible that will help us to keep on the watch ?
Before he brought the great Deluge , though , Jehovah gave people an opportunity to repent .
Really , Noah’s preaching fulfilled its purpose regardless of the response .
Even if there is little positive response , you are having great success .
Because by preaching , you are sounding God’s warning , and thus you are fulfilling the commission that Jesus gave his followers . ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 ; 28 : 19 , 20 .
Idolatry , injustice , oppression , and even murder were common .
If there seemed to be a delay , Habakkuk was not to be discouraged , nor was he to slow down .
Jehovah’s day would not be late !
As time wore on , did they grow weary ?
Illustrating the Need to Be Watchful
( c ) Why was it beneficial for the slaves to be patient ?
Note that Peter also said : “ The end of all things has drawn close . ”
How close ?
( Compare 2 Timothy 4 : 3 , 4 ; Titus 3 : 9 . )
It is by paying close attention to the evidence that the end is near .
First , we clearly see the fulfillment of the apostle Paul’s prophecy concerning “ the last days . ”
*
This has resulted in great woe for the earth .
* Soon , however , Satan will be confined in the abyss so that “ he might not mislead the nations anymore . ” ​ — Revelation 20 : 1 - 3 .
Third , we are living in the time of the eighth and final “ king ” mentioned in the prophecy recorded at Revelation 17 : 9 - 11 .
Here the apostle John mentions seven kings , representing seven world powers ​ — Egypt , Assyria , Babylon , Medo - Persia , Greece , Rome , and the Anglo - American dual world power .
John says that this eighth king “ goes off into destruction , ” after which no further earthly kings are mentioned .
No mention is made of other powers to come .
Fifth , we see a global preaching work being accomplished , which Jesus said would take place just before the end of this system .
Today , that prophecy is in the course of fulfillment on an unprecedented scale .
Evidently , what will be true of some of the anointed when the great tribulation begins , and how may this be determined ?
19 , 20 .
Such individuals are fast asleep !

In the parable of the sheep and the goats , the Son of man arrives in his glory in the period of the great tribulation and sits in judgment .
• What six lines of evidence prove that we are living in the last days ?
“ I [ Jehovah ] will rock all the nations , and the desirable things of all the nations must come in ; and I will fill this house with glory . ” ​ — HAGGAI 2 : 7 .
Would you not , rather , think of your loved ones ?
Now think about Jehovah God and his Son , Jesus Christ .
( Compare Genesis 1 : 31 . )
What “ desirable things ” would fill Jehovah’s house and bring it unprecedented glory ?
Lavish furnishings and ornate decorations ?
Remember , the former temple , inaugurated some five centuries earlier , was a multibillion - dollar edifice !
Despite relentless opposition , the temple was completed in 515 B.C.E .
A First - Century Fulfillment
Then , following the same procedure , he offered up a goat to atone for Israel’s 12 nonpriestly tribes .
How does this observance relate to God’s spiritual temple ?
It was as if a screen blocked their eyes of discernment , just as a screen shielded the Holy from the view of those in the tabernacle courtyard . ​ — Exodus 40 : 28 .
Despite his being a spirit - anointed Son of God , the man Jesus could not attain to life in heaven .
But three days after his death , Jesus was resurrected by God as a spirit .
What did Jesus do upon returning to heaven ?
Yet , Jesus did more .
So by gaining entrance into the Most Holy , or heaven , Jesus opened the way for others to follow .
Remember that the high priest in Israel offered two animals ​ — a bull for the sins of the priests and a goat for the sins of the nonpriestly tribes .
Evidently , it is this second group that is pictured by the “ desirable things ” of Haggai’s prophecy . ​ — Micah 4 : 1 , 2 ; 1 John 2 : 1 , 2 .
How are many “ desirable things ” being drawn to God’s house today ?
In Bolivia , a five - year - old girl being raised by Witness parents asked her teacher for permission to be excused from school during the week of the circuit overseer’s visit .
She wanted to share in the ministry during this entire special week of activity .
This surprised her parents , but they were happy that she had such a fine attitude .
Perhaps in time , some of her Bible students will show themselves to be “ desirable things ” that will glorify Jehovah’s house .
The sister was not deterred .
“ With the passing of time , ” she continued , “ a person may want to choose a religion .
and said that this publication would be a great help when the time came for him to choose a religion .

How was a brother in Cameroon able to start Bible studies with some among a group of ridiculers ?
Wanting to ridicule the brother , they asked him why he did not believe in the Trinity , hellfire , or the immortality of the soul .
In less than a year , he was baptized .
In El Salvador , one man tied his vicious dog in front of the door whenever he saw Jehovah’s Witnesses nearby .
So one day they decided to try a different approach .
Knowing that the man could hear what they were saying , they decided to preach to the dog .
They talked about the time when there would be a paradise on earth , when no one would be angry ​ — yes , when even the animals would be peaceable .
Are you having a share in the vital Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work ?
For I am with you people , ’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies .
Note the reassuring words : “ I am with you people . ”
In what way is unprecedented glory now filling Jehovah’s house ?
Indeed , it is just as he stated through the prophet Haggai : “ Greater will the glory of this later house become than that of the former . . .
And in this place I shall give peace . ”
What should be our determination ?
Whatever was not used for the building work was put into the temple treasury . ​ — 1 Kings 7 : 51 .
• What evidence do we have that Haggai’s prophecy is being fulfilled today ?
Porch
Altar
The high priest offered a bull for the sins of the priests and a goat for the sins of Israel’s nonpriestly tribes
As the following examples show , this fine spirit has opened “ a large door that leads to activity ” in the Netherlands , where one million of the 15 million inhabitants are from other lands . ​ — 1 Corinthians 16 : 9 .
Within a month , Bahram realized that he had found the truth .
A study was started with him and his wife , but there was a problem ​ — their Bible teacher did not speak their language .
Bahram is now a baptized Witness .
Where can we find the answers ?
Surely , then , we have every reason to be confident that the third of these divine judgments will be carried out .
Habakkuk hears what shocking news ?
Envision Jehovah’s prophet Habakkuk sitting on the flat roof of his house , enjoying the cool evening breeze .
At his side is a musical instrument .
They are engaging in false religious acts sponsored by Judah’s wicked King Jehoiakim .
Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful , and you keep looking upon mere trouble ?
And why are despoiling and violence in front of me , and why does quarreling occur , and why is strife carried ?
Instead , ‘ the wicked surround the righteous , ’ circumventing the legal measures intended to protect the innocent .
It is perverted .
No indeed !
After reviewing all the persecution of God’s faithful servants , this loyal man renews his determination to remain firm , steadfast as Jehovah’s prophet .
8 , 9 .
Actually , Jehovah himself is carrying on this activity that they cannot believe .
But what is it ?
This is Jehovah’s message ​ — and no false god or lifeless idol can block its fulfillment : “ Here I am raising up the Chaldeans , the nation bitter and impetuous , which is going to the wide - open places of earth in order to take possession of residences not belonging to it .
Who are being raised up by Jehovah ?
It makes its own inflexible laws .
Raring to go , ‘ its steeds paw the ground ’ impatiently .
From distant Babylon they head for Judah .
At Jehovah’s appointed time , the formidable enemy “ will certainly move onward like wind . ”
In attacking Judah and Jerusalem , it “ will actually become guilty ” of doing injury to God’s people .
As noted at Habakkuk 1 : 12 , the prophet says : “ Are you not from long ago , O Jehovah ?
What course has been pursued by the apostates of Judah ?
God has judged the apostates of Judah adversely , and they are in line for reproof , severe chastisement , by Jehovah .
Yes , Jehovah is “ too pure in eyes to see what is bad , ” that is , to tolerate wrongdoing .
That is why he offers sacrifice to his dragnet and makes sacrificial smoke to his fishing net ; for by them his portion is well oiled , and his food is healthful .
They will not know that they are serving as God’s means for executing his righteous judgment against an unfaithful people .
They view humans as mere ‘ fish and creeping things ’ to be captured and subdued .
Right now , however , Habakkuk waits to hear Jehovah’s further words to him .
His faith in Jehovah as a God who does not tolerate evil makes him wonder why wickedness prevails , but he is willing to have his thinking adjusted .
When we wonder why certain wicked things are tolerated , our confidence in Jehovah God’s righteousness should help us to keep our balance and wait on him . ​ — Psalm 42 : 5 , 11 .
In 607 B.C.E . , they destroyed Jerusalem and the temple , killed old and young alike , and took many captives .
After a long exile in Babylon , a faithful Jewish remnant returned to their homeland and eventually rebuilt the temple .
Thereafter , however , the Jews again proved unfaithful to Jehovah ​ — especially so when they rejected Jesus as the Messiah .
Quoting Habakkuk 1 : 5 from the Greek Septuagint version , Paul warned : “ See to it that what is said in the Prophets does not come upon you , ‘ Behold it , you scorners , and wonder at it , and vanish away , because I am working a work in your days , a work that you will by no means believe even if anyone relates it to you in detail . ’ ”
The royal house of David had never been overthrown .
God’s Unbelievable “ Work ” in Our Day
What will Jehovah’s unbelievable “ work ” involve in our day ?
Be assured that he will , even though that seems unbelievable to doubters .
Surely we would appreciate gaining insight into the deep meaning of such prophetic words for God’s appointed time .
Do You Recall ?
[ Picture on page 10 ]
After World War I , Jehovah restored the faithful anointed remnant to a state of vibrant activity .
For many years Jehovah’s judgment on apostate Jerusalem had been sounded forth .
For the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it keeps panting on to the end , and it will not tell a lie . Even if it should delay , keep in expectation of it ; for it will without fail come true . It will not be late . ”
Today , wickedness and violence run rampant throughout the earth , indicating that we stand at the very brink of “ the great and fear - inspiring day of Jehovah . ”
Jehovah answers by drawing this contrast between the righteous and the unrighteous : “ Look !
In keeping with Paul’s use of Habakkuk 2 : 4 , what must we do ?
Like Paul , we of Jehovah’s holy nation must ‘ stretch forward to the things ahead , pursuing down toward the goal ’ of everlasting life .
And like Jesus , we must ‘ endure for the joy that is set before us . ’ ​ — Hebrews 12 : 2 .
Who is the “ man ” of Habakkuk 2 : 5 , and why will he meet with no success ?
One fourth of the world’s population is said to live below the poverty line .
Likewise , if God’s people today were to fail in exposing the wickedness that exists in this world , ‘ out of the wall a stone itself would cry out plaintively . ’
So let us courageously continue to sound God’s warning !
The Third Woe and the Issue of Bloodguilt
The world’s religions have been responsible for what bloodguilt ?
The third woe announced through Habakkuk takes up the issue of bloodguilt .
Says Habakkuk 2 : 12 : “ Woe to the one that is building a city by bloodshed , and that has solidly established a town by unrighteousness ! ”
Only recently has the Roman Catholic hierarchy in France confessed that it failed to oppose the sending of hundreds of thousands of victims to Nazi death chambers .
Yet , the nations continue to prepare to shed blood , with church support or consent .
Blessings of jet - fighters and barracks have become almost routine .
Can the United Nations put a stop to rearming this world with demonic instruments of war ?
Will Jehovah execute judgment on warmongering nations ?
Habakkuk 2 : 14 provides the answer : “ The earth will be filled with the knowing of the glory of Jehovah as the waters themselves cover over the sea . ”
The fourth woe is described at Habakkuk 2 : 15 in these words : “ Woe to the one giving his companions something to drink , attaching to it your rage and anger , in order to make them drunk , for the purpose of looking upon their parts of shame . ”
This suggests the dissolute , wayward state of the modern world .
A prelude to the fifth woe sternly warns against the worship of carved images .
Jehovah has the prophet pronounce these powerful words : “ Woe to the one saying to the piece of wood : ‘ O do awake ! ’
to a dumb stone : ‘ O wake up !
It itself will give instruction ’ !
Look ! It is sheathed in gold and silver , and there is no breath at all in the midst of it . ”
With a feeling of deep reverence for him , let us heed that stern warning against idolatry .
But listen !
Keep silence before him , all the earth ! ” The prophet doubtless had Jerusalem’s temple in mind .
However , we today are privileged to worship in a far grander spiritual temple arrangement , where our Lord Jesus Christ is installed as High Priest .
Do You Recall ?
• Why should we continue to sound Jehovah’s warning ?

Joyful in the God of Our Salvation
What was Daniel’s reaction ?
According to Hab 3 verse 1 , it is expressed in dirges , songs of grief or lamentation .
The prophet’s prayer is offered as if it were for himself .
When we see the wickedness of mankind today , we too know that Jehovah will act as he did in ancient times .
Jehovah on the March !
How did ‘ God proceed to come from Teman , ’ and what does this indicate regarding Armageddon ?
Shortly before Moses died , he said : “ Jehovah ​ — from Sinai he came , and he flashed forth from Seir upon them . He beamed forth from the mountainous region of Paran , and with him were holy myriads [ of angels ] . ”
When Jehovah moves against his enemies at Armageddon , there will be a similar display of his irresistible might .
What a magnificent spectacle !
As for faithful servants of God , however , the eyes of their hearts are dazzled when they contemplate his magnificence .
And discerning Christians see something in addition to Jehovah’s glory .
Hear now the prophet’s graphic description of Jehovah of armies in action .
Human organizations ​ — even those that seem as permanent as “ the eternal mountains ” and “ the indefinitely lasting hills ” — ​ will crumble .
9 , 10 .
A thunderstorm of waters passed through .
On high its hands it lifted up .
Sun ​ — moon — ​ stood still , in the lofty abode thereof . Like light your own arrows kept going .
The lightning of your spear served for brightness . ” ​ — Habakkuk 3 : 7 - 11 .
In the days of Deborah the prophetess , torrential rains washed away the chariots of Israel’s enemy Sisera .
Whether this inspired prophetic description of Armageddon is literal or symbolic , one thing is sure ​ — Jehovah will prevail , allowing no enemy to escape .
The prophet continues to describe Jehovah’s actions in destroying His enemies .
In anger you went threshing the nations . ” Still , Jehovah will not destroy at random .
Some humans will be saved .
Will that satanic assault succeed ?
It will be shattered .
The whole structure will be demolished , down to its foundation .
It will no longer exist .
According to Habakkuk 3 : 14 , 15 , the prophet speaks to God , saying : “ With his own rods you pierced the head of his warriors when they moved tempestuously to scatter me . Their high glee was as of those bent on devouring an afflicted one in a place of concealment .
Through the sea you trod with your horses , through the heap of vast waters . ”
When Habakkuk says “ warriors . . . moved tempestuously to scatter me , ” the prophet speaks for Jehovah’s anointed servants .
Like highwaymen lying in wait , the nations will leap out upon Jehovah’s worshipers to destroy them .
We can be sure that Habakkuk’s words will soon be fulfilled .
How do you react to this foreknowledge ?
Warfare always brings hardship , even to the eventual victors .
Habakkuk realistically expected hardships , perhaps famine .
Today , even before Jehovah’s war against the wicked , many suffer severe distress .
Many of our fellow believers live in lands severely afflicted by the fulfillment of Jesus ’ words , and they suffer great hardships as a result .
Whatever temporary hardships we have to face , we will not lose faith in Jehovah’s saving power .
Let us always ‘ exult in Jehovah and be joyful in the God of our salvation . ’

Do you know what forces God will use against the wicked at Armageddon ?
OUR parents ​ — our father and mother — ​ can be a valuable source of encouragement , support , and counsel .
In Pr 31 verses 13 to 27 are listed counsel and principles that wives in any age can use for the benefit of their families .
Obviously , this woman does not eat “ the bread of laziness . ”
She works hard , and she efficiently coordinates her household’s activities .
No doubt speaking from personal experience , Lemuel’s mother reminds her son about the importance of showing appreciation for his prospective wife .
No one on earth would be dearer to him .
“ Getting on the bus is literally a big step for us .
Some drivers pull over to the mound , but others do not .
Our neighbors know that talking to strangers has always been an intimidating experience for us .
But God told him : “ My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you ; for my power is being made perfect in weakness . ”
Yes , a physical handicap need not be removed for us to be able to serve God .
Complete reliance on God can help us to make the best of our circumstances .
In modern times , God is accomplishing a mighty work through men , women , and children who are fully devoted to him .
Some have depicted him as manly and vibrant , while others have portrayed him as frail and pallid .
The Gospel accounts not only report what Jesus said and did but also reveal the depth of feeling and the pattern of thinking behind his words and actions .
These four inspired accounts enable us to peer into what the apostle Paul referred to as “ the mind of Christ . ”
For at least two reasons .
Our becoming acquainted with the mind of Christ can give us what insight ?
First , the mind of Christ gives us a glimpse into the mind of Jehovah God .
If we are truly to act like Christ , what must we first learn , and why ?
The Gospel of John calls attention to Jesus ’ prehuman existence as “ the Word , ” or Spokesman , of God .
Jesus is “ the firstborn of all creation . ”
This Son came to know and reflect his Father’s thoughts , feelings , and ways as no one else could . ​ — Matthew 11 : 27 .
What is one of the reasons why it was necessary for God’s firstborn Son to come to earth ?
God’s Son had more to learn , for Jehovah’s purpose was to equip his Son to be a compassionate High Priest , able to “ sympathize with our weaknesses . ”
Even more , he endured all manner of hardships and suffering .
Nevertheless , Jesus was fully human .
( b ) In what type of circumstances did Jesus likely grow up ?
This is indicated by the offering Joseph and Mary brought to the temple about 40 days after his birth .
Recall that when greeting her , the angel Gabriel said : “ Good day , highly favored one , Jehovah is with you . ”
Each year he faithfully made the 90 - mile [ 150 km ] journey to Jerusalem for the Passover .
Mary also attended , even though only males were required to do so .
On one such occasion , Joseph and Mary , after a diligent search , found 12 - year - old Jesus in the temple in the midst of the teachers .
In addition , Joseph must have been a good adoptive father to Jesus .
During his years in Nazareth , Jesus learned the carpentry trade , likely from his adoptive father , Joseph .
In his Dialogue With Trypho , Justin Martyr , of the second century C.E . , wrote of Jesus : “ He was in the habit of working as a carpenter when among men , making ploughs and yokes . ”
Such work was not easy , for the ancient carpenter probably could not buy his wood .
So Jesus may have known the challenges of earning a living , dealing with customers , and making ends meet .
Then , in 29 C.E . , the time came for Jesus to carry out the divine assignment awaiting him .
‘ The heavens were opened up to him , ’ evidently indicating that he could now recall his prehuman life in heaven , including the thoughts and feelings that went with it .
What demonstrates that Jesus had a balanced view of life and material things ?
His teachings reflected his heartfelt desire to acquaint his listeners with the thoughts , feelings , and ways of Jehovah . ​ — John 17 : 6 - 8 .
It is one thing to talk in general terms about the mercy of God .
It is quite another to liken Jehovah to a forgiving father who is so deeply moved at the sight of his returning son that he ‘ runs and falls upon his son’s neck and tenderly kisses him . ’
Understandably , people were astounded at Jesus ’ “ way of teaching ” and were drawn to him .
Why , on one occasion “ a big crowd ” remained near him for three days , even going without food ! ​ — Mark 8 : 1 , 2 .
Satan is there depicted as a “ dragon ” who was able to use his influence to get other “ stars , ” or spirit sons , to join him in a rebellious course . ​ — Compare Job 38 : 7 .
The last direct mention of Joseph is when 12 - year - old Jesus was found in the temple .
• What do the Gospels reveal about the personality of Jesus ?
[ Picture on page 10 ]
The teachers were amazed at the understanding and answers of 12 - year - old Jesus
“ HE HAS never once been seen to laugh . ”
Clearly , to know the real Jesus , we must fill our minds and hearts with an accurate understanding of the kind of person Jesus truly was while here on earth .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What was the setting of the account recorded at Mark 10 : 13 - 16 ?
People felt drawn to Jesus .
On various occasions , individuals of differing ages and backgrounds freely approached him .
The children obviously are at ease as Jesus takes them into his caring arms .
That brief account tells us much about the kind of person Jesus was .
Elders , if you cultivate a sincere , heartfelt interest in your brothers and are willing to give of yourself in their behalf , they will sense your concern .
Considerate of Others
Jesus then did something a bit unusual .
He took the man aside , away from the crowd , to a private place .
Next , Jesus looked up to heaven and uttered a prayerful sigh .
10 , 11 .
Willing to Trust Others
Jesus had what balanced , realistic view of his disciples ?
After all , he could read human hearts .
Even so , he saw them not simply in terms of their imperfections but in terms of their good qualities .
He also saw the potential in these men whom Jehovah had drawn .
Jesus ’ positive view of his disciples was evident in the way he dealt with and treated them .
How did Jesus demonstrate that he trusted his disciples ?
When he left the earth , he delegated a heavy responsibility to his anointed disciples .
During his ministry , he showed even in small , indirect ways that he trusted them .
When he miraculously multiplied food to feed the crowds , he delegated to his disciples the responsibility of distributing the food . ​ — Matthew 14 : 15 - 21 ; 15 : 32 - 37 .
On this occasion Jesus and his disciples boarded a boat and sailed east across the Sea of Galilee .
The calm of one moment may well yield to the raging storm of the next .
Think about this : Jesus undoubtedly knew of the common storms , for he was raised in Galilee .
He let them know that he had confidence in them .
This was clearly evident in the reassuring words he spoke to his apostles on the final night of his earthly life .
Afterward , he instituted the evening meal that would be a memorial of his death .
They faithfully spearheaded the work of preaching the good news in the first century . ​ — Acts 2 : 41 , 42 ; 4 : 33 ; 5 : 27 - 32 .
20 , 21 .
Do not be pessimistic about fellow believers .
People respond more readily to love and encouragement than to intimidation .
We can build up and encourage others by expressing confidence in them .
[ Footnotes ]
Bible translator Edgar J .
However , in the parallel account , Luke uses a word that is also used of infants . ​ — Luke 1 : 41 ; 2 : 12 ; 18 : 15 .
• In what ways did Jesus show consideration for others ?
Why is it understandable that individuals display admirable qualities ?
So we can appreciate why many would show a degree of love , kindness , compassion , and other divine qualities , even as most reflect a conscience .
Jesus ’ displays of love , tenderness , and compassion are reflections of “ the mind of Christ , ” who in turn was imitating his heavenly Father . ​ — 1 Corinthians 2 : 16 .
To have a balanced view of Jesus ’ good works , what do we need to consider ?
We read there that people brought the sick to Jesus to be healed .
Healing the sick and feeding the hungry were outstanding displays of loving compassion , but were they the primary ways in which Jesus helped others ?
Moved to Respond to Spiritual Needs
How did Jesus feel toward the crowds that came to him , and what did he do in response ?
Jesus ’ heart was touched by the sight of this crowd of thousands , including sick ones , who eagerly awaited him .
Jesus saw more than a mass of people .
This was written by Luke , who was a physician and keenly interested in the physical well - being of others .
Though it is not so with every account of a miracle , in this case , what did Luke’s inspired account note first ?
It was the fact that Jesus taught the people .
He taught the people , responding to their spiritual needs .
That truth was of central importance because of the role of the Kingdom in vindicating Jehovah’s sovereignty and providing permanent blessings for humans .
We have noted in the two preceding articles that Jesus was a person of tender feelings ​ — caring , approachable , considerate , trusting , and above all , loving .
The prophecy at Deuteronomy 18 : 18 stressed what role for “ the prophet ” to come ?
That would be the very best that they could do for people .
How is having the mind of Christ involved in our preaching ?
And we would readily admit that we are obliged to preach the good news and to make disciples .
Why is compassion an appropriate part of our public ministry ?
Yet , if we were to lose our love and compassion for people , we could lose a vital motivation for sharing in the Christian ministry .
When you thus ponder the spiritual needs of those around you , does not your heart move you to want to do all you can to tell them about God’s loving purpose ?
Yet , such manifestations of love , kindness , and compassion must not become the main focus of our good works , as they are with some humanitarians .
It is up to us to read , meditate upon , and put into practice what the Bible reveals about Jesus .
• What did Jesus stress in directing his followers ?
What is the greatest good that Christians can do for others ?

“ Due to the abundance of dynamic energy , he also being vigorous in power , not one of them is missing . ” ​ — ISAIAH 40 : 26 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) On what physical power source do we all depend ?
( b ) Explain why Jehovah is ultimately the Source of all power .
Only an unexpected power outage brings home to us that without power , man’s cities would practically shut down .
However , we rely on the power of God for much more than our basic physical needs .
Today , astronomers know much more about the immensity of the universe and the power that sustains it .
For example , they tell us that our sun every second emits energy equivalent to the explosion of 100,000 million megatons of TNT .
Still , our sun is by no means the most powerful star in the heavens .
What evidence of Jehovah’s strength do we find in his works ?
Jehovah told Job : “ Its power is in its hips . . .
The others are love , wisdom , and justice .
Jesus was likewise conscious of angelic support when he faced a mob armed with swords and clubs in the garden of Gethsemane .
If God is for us , who will be against us ? ” ​ — Romans 8 : 31 .
We have every reason , then , to trust in Jehovah’s protection .
He always uses his power for good and in harmony with his other qualities ​ — justice , wisdom , and love .
On several occasions , Jehovah manifested his might to his servants .
Ten devastating plagues had revealed the strong hand of Jehovah and the impotence of Egyptian gods .
Soon thereafter , the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army gave further proof of divine strength .
For their part , they promised : “ All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do . ”
Then , Jehovah provided a vivid demonstration of his power .
The people , standing at a distance , were terrified .
12 , 13 .
To reassure and strengthen him , Jehovah kindly gave him a personal demonstration of divine power .
While Elijah hid in a cave , he saw an awe - inspiring exhibition of three of the forces that Jehovah controls : a strong wind , an earthquake , and finally a fire .
What does Jehovah’s personal name reveal , and how is his power connected with his name ?
To illustrate , Jehovah once promised Abraham and Sarah that he would make their descendants a great nation .
They were both very old when Jehovah told them that the promise was about to be fulfilled and Sarah laughed .
In reply , the angel said : “ Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah ? ”
Now is the time to build our faith and confidence in God the Almighty so that we will not waver at that crucial time .
Without doubt , there are many reasons for meditating on Jehovah’s power .
Our faith in his promises will be unwavering .
Remember , though , that we have been created in the image of God .
Hence , we also have power ​ — albeit to a limited extent .
Two thousand years ago , these animals were found in Gaul ( now France ) , and Julius Caesar wrote the following description of them : “ These uri are scarcely less than elephants in size , but in their nature , colour , and form , are bulls .
[ Pictures on page 13 ]
Modern history abounds with examples showing the general truth of Lord Acton’s words .
“ As regards Jehovah , his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ”
Patience holds back God’s execution of the wicked to give them the opportunity to repent .
Why is it so important that we be determined not to lose sight of the protection of our heavenly Father ?
Realizing that the military advantage was on the side of his enemies , Asa prayed : “ O Jehovah , as to helping , it does not matter with you whether there are many or those with no power . Help us , O Jehovah our God , for upon you we do lean , and in your name we have come against this crowd . O Jehovah , you are our God .
Do not let mortal man retain strength against you . ”
When faced with problems , let us not rely on human solutions .
Because when we do things in God’s strength , our power will be used for the benefit , rather than the harm , of others .
Nowhere do we find a better example of this than in Jesus Christ , who performed many miracles in “ Jehovah’s power . ”
A case in point is Assyrian King Esar - haddon , who boastfully declared : “ I am powerful , I am all powerful , I am a hero , I am gigantic , I am colossal . ”
Second , we can draw spiritual strength from the Bible .
Third , we draw strength from Jehovah through Christian association .
Paul encouraged Christians to attend meetings regularly in order to “ incite to love and fine works ” and to encourage one another .
When Peter was miraculously released from prison , he wanted to be with his brothers , so he went straight to the house of the mother of John Mark , where “ quite a few were gathered together and praying . ”
As long as we are free and able to associate with one another , we must not try to walk alone along the cramped road leading off into life . ​ — Proverbs 18 : 1 ; Matthew 7 : 14 .
No one should hesitate to ask Jehovah for “ power beyond what is normal ” to cope with such challenges . ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 7 .
“ Giving to the Tired One Power ”
As a result , his ministry was effective .
What strengthened Jeremiah to persevere despite opposition ?
When confronted by an indifferent spirit in our territory ​ — a territory in which we may have preached repeatedly for years with little response — ​ we may become disheartened .
His message “ proved to be like a burning fire shut up in [ his ] bones . ”
Jeremiah’s appreciation of the vital importance of his message and of his God - given assignment made him responsive to Jehovah’s encouragement .
The tongue , for example , has the power to hurt as well as to heal .
“ Death and life are in the power of the tongue , ” warns Solomon .
We too can do much damage with the tongue .
A thoughtful tongue can reassure elderly brothers and sisters that they are still needed and loved .
The Proper Use of Power
16 , 17 .
True , overseers sometimes need to “ reprove , reprimand , exhort , ” but this is done “ with all long - suffering and art of teaching . ”
So elders constantly meditate on the words that the apostle Peter wrote to those with authority in the congregation : “ Shepherd the flock of God in your care , not under compulsion , but willingly ; neither for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ” ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 2 , 3 ; 1 Thessalonians 2 : 7 , 8 .
Jesus ’ example shows that authority can be effectively exercised in a loving way .
( b ) What should those with authority try to instill in those under their care ?
Those with authority in the family and in the congregation should be especially careful to control their anger , since anger instills fear rather than love .
Love is the strongest bond of union and the strongest motivation for doing what is right . ​ — 1 Corinthians 13 : 8 , 13 ; Colossians 3 : 14 .
I will really help you . I will really keep fast hold of you with my right hand of righteousness . ”
Like Jesus , let us always use whatever power Jehovah gives us to help and to build up .
Apparently , the Jews discovered the original copy of the Law of Moses , which had been deposited in the temple centuries earlier .
Proclaiming the Word of God is within our power if our heart is in it
He starts out early in the morning and sees little .
The rest he sees in hazy outline .
Centuries later , Jehovah favored them with light and truth of a most remarkable kind .
That was a new idea for a Roman and surely for nationalistic Jews , for they thought that the Messiah would bring the Roman Empire to its knees and restore Israel to its former glory .
However , a few honesthearted men and women joyfully embraced the truth that Jesus taught .
That question had not been answered in the vision , and the matter became a subject of heated debate among Christians .
As they pondered the evidence , God’s will became clear .
The apostles and the older men wasted no time in putting the decision in writing so that fellow Christians could be guided by it . ​ — Acts 15 : 12 - 29 ; 16 : 4 .
In what way were first - century Christians progressive ?
( b ) What pertinent questions will we consider ?
Spiritual light continued to shine throughout the first century .
The apostle Paul told first - century fellow believers : “ At present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror . ”
Such a mirror did not have the best reflective surface .
At first , then , comprehension of spiritual light would be limited .
How does Jehovah enlighten his people today ?
The Light Gets Progressively Brighter
Unlike the religious leaders of the day , the Bible Students ( as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known ) were determined to let the Holy Scriptures , not tradition or man - made dogma , be their guide .
Brother Russell intended to write a seventh volume , which would explain the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation .
In 1971 an explanation of Ezekiel’s prophecy was published in the book “ The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah ” ​ — How ?
How so ?
These priests clearly represent the “ royal priesthood , ” Jehovah’s anointed servants .
Anyone who wishes to come to a knowledge of the truth must be willing to bring “ every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ . ”
After you began to study the Bible , you realized that these celebrations are actually of pagan origin .
It is “ the path of the righteous ones , ” which “ is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established . ”
In the meantime , may we exult in the truths that Jehovah has made plain , awaiting enlightenment on those that are not yet clearly understood .
magazines also furnish us with an abundance of wholesome spiritual food to enjoy .
Do you look forward to worshiping Jehovah , along with a multitude of others ?
What can we do to deepen our appreciation for Christian meetings ?
We invite you to consider this subject prayerfully in the following article .
T .
The volume was based , in part , on comments that Russell had made on those Bible books .
However , the time to reveal the meaning of those prophecies had not yet come , and in general , the explanation offered in that volume of Studies in the Scriptures was hazy .
• Why does Jehovah reveal his purposes progressively ?
• Illustrate how spiritual light is revealed in God’s due time .
Charles Taze Russell knew that light would shine on the book of Revelation in God’s due time
“ Lead me in the path of uprightness . ” ​ — PSALM 27 : 11 .
( b ) What is involved in taking full advantage of the meetings ?
JEHOVAH is the Source of light and truth , as we learned in the preceding article .
His Word lights our way as we travel along the path of uprightness .
Like the psalmist of old , we gratefully respond to God’s leadings and pray : “ Instruct me , O Jehovah , in your way , and lead me in the path of uprightness . ” ​ — Psalm 27 : 11 .
Our family just did not miss meetings . ”
( b ) Why is it critical to attend meetings ?
Are you among those who attend Christian meetings regularly , or have you become sporadic in this respect ?
For a few weeks , they made a note of every meeting they attended .
True , when we arrive home at the end of a hard day , we may not always feel inclined to attend a meeting .
Be a Good Listener
The teacher knows that if the child tries to pay attention , he will derive at least some benefit from the lesson .
In Bible times , he commanded his young servants to ‘ listen and learn and fear Jehovah and take care to carry out all the words of this law , ’ some of which doubtless were hard for children to understand .

What steps do some parents take to help their children to be attentive at meetings ?
Hence , some parents arrange for their children to take a nap before the meetings so that they will arrive at the Kingdom Hall refreshed and ready to learn .
Mentally review the points as they are being considered .
Even before they learn to read and write , some preschoolers are encouraged by their parents to take “ notes ” during meetings .
They put a mark on a piece of paper when such familiar words as “ Jehovah , ” “ Jesus , ” or “ Kingdom ” are used .
Let Your Voice Be Heard
One way we can do this is by sharing in congregational singing .
They are thrilled to be able to sing along with the grown - ups .
As children grow a little older , however , they may be less inclined to join in singing Kingdom songs .
We also bring praise to God when we make upbuilding comments during the parts of our meetings that call for audience participation .
It takes time to ponder the deeper aspects of God’s Word .
What suggestions may help one to comment at meetings ?
Nothing elaborate is necessary .
Some publishers ask the study conductor to reserve the first comment on a specific paragraph for them , so that they will not miss the opportunity to express their faith .
16 , 17 .
What counsel did one elder give to a ministerial servant , and why was it effective ?
He kindly pointed out ways that the young man could display reasonableness in his relations with others .
Not at all !
“ The elder used the Bible , ” he explained , “ so I realized that the counsel was coming from Jehovah . ”
The ministerial servant gratefully applied the counsel and is making fine progress .
God’s Word can also help young people to “ flee from the desires incidental to youth . ”
In harmony with that counsel , she boldly shared her Bible - based beliefs with her classmates on every appropriate occasion .
A young man living in Africa learned this firsthand .
When one of Jehovah’s Witnesses visited him , he accepted a Bible study .
He enjoyed what he was learning but soon became involved in bad association at school .
That is why I could not stand up to temptation .
How can a young person resist Satan’s assaults ?
The psalmist , evidently a young man himself , understood this .
The route he chose may have seemed needlessly arduous from a human perspective .
Can You Explain ?
For thousands of years , people have fished the earth’s seas , lakes , and rivers .
Some of Jesus Christ’s apostles were fishermen on the Sea of Galilee .
To them , however , Jesus introduced another kind of fishing .
This was spiritual fishing that would benefit not only the fishermen but also the fish .
In this regard , Jesus told the fisherman Peter : “ From now on you will be catching men alive . ”
It stretches from sandy desert areas bordering the Sahara in the north to humid forests of the Casamance region in the south .
Many are shepherds , while others are herdsmen of cattle , camels , and goats .
There are also farmers , cultivating peanuts , cotton , and rice .
A branch office of the Watch Tower Society was opened in Dakar , the capital , in 1965 .
Often it takes courage to take a firm stand for Christian principles , especially when family traditions and customs are involved .
Would he have the courage to accept Christian truth and conform to the Scriptural requirement to be the husband of only one wife ?
Does this mean that an illiterate person cannot accept and practice the truth ?
Consider the example of Marie , a hardworking mother of eight young children .
But how could she do this , since she could not read ?
Next she thanked the passerby and quickly entered her house to have a lively discussion of the text with her children before they left for school !
People of All Sorts Respond
The beggar was surprised .
He was so insistent that this attracted the attention of everyone passing by .
The large university in Dakar is also adding to the catch in the spiritual fishing net .
There a medical student named Jean - Louis began to study the Bible .
His desire was to serve God in the full - time pioneer service , but he also enjoyed his study of medicine .
Yet , he began serving as an auxiliary pioneer at the same time .
The Bible literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses is greatly appreciated and is now being produced in the local Wolof language .
[ Credit Line ]
At Romans 12 : 19 , was the apostle Paul indicating that Christians should not become wrathful , when he said : “ Do not avenge yourselves , beloved , but yield place to the wrath ” ?
“ Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you . ”
Paul recommended that our love be without hypocrisy , that we bless those persecuting us , that we try to think well of others , that we not return evil for evil , and that we strive to be peaceable with all .
The better course , the wiser course , is to let God determine when and upon whom vengeance is to be brought .
He can do so with full knowledge of the facts , and any retribution he takes will reflect his perfect justice .
We can see that this is Paul’s point at Romans 12 : 19 when we note his reference to Deuteronomy 32 : 35 , 41 , which includes these words : “ Vengeance is mine , and retribution . ”
WITCHCRAFT !
Some investigators say that more than half the world’s population believe that witches are real and can influence the lives of others .
In Western lands , however , witchcraft has donned a new mask of respectability .
Hollywood is good at picking up on trends . . . .
Their answer , summarized by researcher Margot Adler , was : “ We are not evil .
We are ordinary people like you .
We are much more similar to you than you think . ”
But does this mean that there is no reason to be concerned about the practice of witchcraft ?
One guidebook for aspiring witches states : “ When you’re challenged with seemingly contradictory information , examine this information and make a decision as to which to follow .
Things are not true simply because a person feels or hopes or believes that they are true .
People do not create truth ; they reach out to comprehend it .
The Bible claims to contain the truth about spiritual matters .
Instead , they look for inspiration and guidance in myth , ancient religions , and even science fiction .
Is it not reasonable , though , at least to consider what the Bible says ?
It is also one of the oldest religious texts that has survived .
Let us compare the Bible’s teachings with some common beliefs currently expressed by those who promote witchcraft .
Who Dwell in the Spirit Realm ?
Another authority writes : “ One of the most pivotal choices in Witchcraft is your choice of the deities ( Gods / ​ Goddesses ) you will work with . . . .
The Craft gives you the freedom to pick and subsequently honor your own forms of the Divine . ”
The Bible supports none of these ideas .
For all the gods of the peoples are valueless gods . ” ​ — 1 Chronicles 16 : 25 , 26 .
It would be hard to find a witch today who would agree with this definition , for many do not accept even the existence of Satan the Devil .
Magic , of course , has always been associated with the occult .
* Many people in both ancient and modern times believe that the magic practiced by witches is performed to bring harm to others .
Traditionally , witches have been blamed for an almost limitless array of misfortunes , including illness , death , and crop failure .
Examples of this so - called benevolent magic include spells to protect yourself , to purify your home from negative energy left behind by former tenants , to make a person fall in love with you , to promote healing and health , to prevent the loss of your job , and to acquire money .
We also read : “ There should not be found in you . . . a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer , or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium . ” ​ — Deuteronomy 18 : 10 , 11 .
It is not because he intends to deny us what is beneficial .
Instead , he invites his servants to approach him for the things they need .
He is the Giver of “ every good gift and every perfect present . ”
The apostle John assured fellow believers : “ Whatever we ask we receive from [ God ] , because we are observing his commandments and are doing the things that are pleasing in his eyes . ” ​ — 1 John 3 : 22 .
What About Evil Spirits ?
The most intelligent variety . . . are capable ( if someone is helpful enough to open a doorway for them ) of entering our world . . . .
In Bible times , demon possession afflicted people in various ways .
Religion Based on Truth
In some communities it has become accepted .
Naturally , we are free to choose which path to take .
[ Footnote ] In English , some use the spelling “ magick ” to distinguish the difference between the occult variety and stage illusions .
The Bible reveals the way of truth
FOR centuries , false messiahs have tried to predict the future .
The caliph , or ruler , asked him for a sign of his messiahship .
The caliph agreed to the plan ​ — and that was the end of that “ messiah . ”
there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , conversing with him . ”
The transfiguration evidently occurred at night , making it especially vivid .
For he received from God the Father honor and glory , when words such as these were borne to him by the magnificent glory : ‘ This is my son , my beloved , whom I myself have approved . ’ Yes , these words we heard borne from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain . ” ​ — 2 Peter 1 : 16 - 18 .
( b ) What was indicated by the cloud that appeared in the transfiguration ?
The overshadowing cloud indicated that the fulfillment of this vision would be invisible .
It would be discernible only with the eyes of understanding on the part of those who recognize “ the sign ” of Jesus ’ invisible presence in Kingdom power .
Peter used the word “ daystar ” to refer to Jesus after He received Kingdom power .
( a ) Why does 2 Peter 1 : 19 not mean that “ a daystar ” arises in actual human hearts ?
Many Bible translations foster the idea that the apostle Peter’s words recorded at 2 Peter 1 : 19 refer to the physical human heart .
This verse might be expressed in this way : ‘ We have the prophetic word made more sure ; and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place , that is , in your hearts , until day dawns and a daystar rises . ’
If we are true Christians , however , it is as if we have a lamp shining in our hearts , which would otherwise be dark .
They would be aware of the fact that the Daystar had risen , not in fleshly human hearts , but before all creation .
We know that we are on the threshold of the best of times because we are very deep into “ the time of the end ” !
What must we do to experience the fulfillment of the Bible’s wonderful prophecies ?
Paul wrote : “ God , who long ago spoke on many occasions and in many ways to our forefathers by means of the prophets , has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son , whom he appointed heir of all things . ”
Paul went on to say : “ If the word spoken through angels proved to be firm , and every transgression and disobedient act received a retribution in harmony with justice ; how shall we escape if we have neglected a salvation of such greatness in that it began to be spoken through our Lord and was verified for us by those who heard him , while God joined in bearing witness with signs as well as portents and various powerful works and with distributions of holy spirit according to his will ? ”
Humans alone cannot come up with true prophecy , but we can have full faith in all of God’s prophecies .
These originate with Jehovah God himself .
By holy spirit he has enabled his servants to understand how Bible prophecies are being fulfilled .
It is vital that we keep on paying attention to divine predictions while we let our light shine .
It gives us guidance and shows us the future as foretold in God’s Word , the Bible .
What is Jehovah’s Daystar now ready to do ?
The Daystar has already risen .
Fighters Against God Will Not Prevail !
This occurred during the reign of good King Josiah of Judah .
Jeremiah’s prophetic ministry continued through the turbulent period prior to Babylon’s conquest of Jerusalem and into the taking of God’s people into exile . ​ — Jeremiah 1 : 1 - 3 .
The judgment messages that Jeremiah was to declare were bound to stir up opposition .
Jehovah’s Servants Under Attack
Anointed servants of Jehovah faced many tests of faith during World War I .
In May 1918 , federal warrants were issued for the arrest of the Watch Tower Society’s president , J .
Rutherford , and seven of his closest associates .
In May 1919 the circuit court of appeals ruled that the defendants had not had an impartial trial , and the judgment was therefore reversed .
Thousands were thrown into concentration camps because they refused to renounce their faith .
The Nazis maintained that the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses were inimical , or hostile , and ‘ disturbed the National Socialistic construction . ’
What efforts were made to stop our work during World War II and thereafter ?
In the United States , influential enemies and misinformed people brought ‘ trouble framed by decree . ’
The thousands of Witnesses held captive in concentration camps were freed , but the fight was not over .
Eastern European nations brought further pressure on Jehovah’s people .
International conventions were held there in 1985 .
They Look for a Pretext
Under pressure from religious quarters of Christendom , opposers look for a so - called legal way to justify their fight against us .
Well , what did conspirators do in attacking the prophet Daniel ?
Consequently these able - bodied men were saying : ‘ We shall find in this Daniel no pretext at all , except we have to find it against him in the law of his God . ’ ”
They clamor about “ dangerous cults ” and try to pin this label on Jehovah’s Witnesses .
By misrepresentation , innuendo , and falsehood , they attack our worship and our adherence to godly principles .
In some lands , religious and political elements refuse to acknowledge that we practice “ the form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God . ”
Though our Christian activities are carried on in 234 lands , opposers claim that we are not a “ known religion . ”
Shortly before an international convention in 1998 , an Athens newspaper quoted the Greek Orthodox clergy as claiming that “ [ Jehovah’s Witnesses ] are not a ‘ known religion , ’ ” despite the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights to the contrary .
This is amazing , for no other religious group puts more emphasis on imitating Jesus than do Jehovah’s Witnesses !
In waging our spiritual warfare , what must we do ?
We seek to defend and establish the good news by legal means .
Like Jeremiah , we ‘ gird up our hips and speak everything that Jehovah commands us , ’ not allowing fighters against God to strike us with any terror .
Persecuted but Uncompromising
After examining the case of Jesus , Pilate was willing to release him .
In place of him , they called for the release of Barabbas ​ — a man imprisoned for sedition and murder !
And on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , through the glorified Jesus , holy spirit was poured out , establishing the Christian congregation ​ — “ a new creation . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 17 ; Acts 2 : 1 - 4 .
Threats , arrests , and floggings could not deter them from expanding their Kingdom activity .
“ They felt deeply cut and were wanting to do away with [ the apostles ] . ”
However , a Law teacher by the name of Gamaliel , a Pharisee , was present , and he was esteemed by all the people .
No Weapon Formed Against Us Will Succeed
In your own words , how would you express the assurance that Jehovah gives his people ?
Never will we allow those who hate our Bible message to intimidate us into compromising our faith .
[ Picture on page 21 ]
In Jesus ’ case , fighters against God did not prevail
“ You Know So Much About the Bible ”
Similarly today , many young servants of Jehovah muster up courage to speak to their teachers and schoolmates about God and the Bible , and often they experience equally gratifying results .
Tiffany , age 14 , was in a class where one discussion was directed to the Bible prophecy of the 70 weeks of years , found at Daniel 9 : 24 - 27 .
At first , Tiffany was hesitant about raising her hand .
Given the opportunity to explain the prophecy , Tiffany stood up and spoke extemporaneously .
As she finished , there was absolute silence in the classroom .
Tiffany was a little nervous .
At the end of the class , he asked Tiffany how she knew so much about the Bible .
When she did so and showed the teacher the portion that explains Daniel’s prophecy , he readily accepted the book and thanked her for it .
Truly , when Christian youths courageously speak about what their parents have taught them regarding God and the Bible , they bring praise and honor to Jehovah and blessings to themselves . ​ — Matthew 21 : 15 , 16 .
1 , 2 .
Why are many people rightly hesitant to consider what the future holds ?
Humans simply do not have the ability to predict accurately what will occur in the months or years to come .
The magazine Forbes ASAP devoted an issue to time .
In it , TV documentary host Robert Cringely wrote : “ Time eventually humiliates us all , but no one suffers at the hands of time more than prognosticators .
3 , 4 . ( a ) Some have what optimism about the new millennium ?
( b ) What realistic expectation do others have about the future ?
Professor Chris Dewdney of York University gave this reason for optimism : “ The millennium means that we can wash our hands of a really terrible century . ”
Clearly , most sense that a new millennium cannot banish our problems , making all things new .
You may wonder , ‘ Since men cannot foretell what our future holds , should we not just ignore the future ? ’
They actually foretell a future that is very bright .
That occurred more than a hundred years after Isaiah predicted it . ​ — 2 Chronicles 36 : 15 - 21 .
The initial fulfillment of Isaiah 65 : 17 - 19 involved the ancient Jews who , as Isaiah accurately predicted , did return to their homeland , where they reestablished pure worship .
You realize , of course , that they returned to a homeland on the same planet , not somewhere else in the universe .
That realization can help us to see what Isaiah meant by new heavens and a new earth .
The Bible itself clarifies what Isaiah meant .
We know that our planet ​ — the terra firma and the vast oceans — ​ cannot sing .
As to the combination phrase “ heaven and earth , ” the Cyclopædia explains that ‘ in prophetic language the phrase signifies the political condition of persons of different ranks .
Zerubbabel , a descendant of King David , was governor , and Joshua was high priest .
( b ) Why is Peter’s prophecy of particular interest at this time ?
You can see this by moving to another occurrence of the phrase “ new heavens and a new earth . ”
In 2Pe 3 verse 4 , Peter brings up Jesus ’ “ promised presence , ” which makes the prophecy very pertinent today .
You may already have learned that Jesus in heaven is the key Ruler in the “ new heavens . ”
Jesus promised that the apostles and some others like them would have a place in heaven .
17 , 18 .
In 2Pe 3 verses 5 and 6 , Peter writes about the Flood of Noah’s day , the Deluge that ended the wicked world back then .
This confirms that the phrase “ the heavens and the earth that are now ” refers , not to the material universe , but to humans and their rulerships .
Does that not suggest that some major changes for the better must occur ?
Battling against whom ?
This sets the stage for considering Revelation chapter 21 .
Revelation 21 : 1 indicates that what significant change lies ahead ?
John continues in Re 21 verses 4 , 5 : “ He [ Jehovah ] will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . The former things have passed away .
Also , he says : ‘ Write , because these words are faithful and true . ’ ”
The end of what conditions is guaranteed by John’s prophecy ?
Who of us has not lost a loved one to some disease , accident , or disaster ?
You would no doubt agree that mourning and outcry would decrease with the removal of death , old age , and disease .
The New English Bible renders Psalm 96 : 1 : “ Sing to the LORD , all men on earth . ”
• What are three instances where the Bible foretells “ new heavens and a new earth ” ?
• How were the ancient Jews involved in a fulfillment of “ new heavens and a new earth ” ?
One of those reliable predictions is recorded at Revelation 21 : 1 .
Why can we trust the Bible’s promises about the future ?
Note how Revelation 21 : 5 continues .
That divine promise is better than any national declaration of independence , any present - day bill of rights , or any human aspiration for the future .
What Bible prophecies already considered can bolster our confidence about what lies ahead ?
Definitely not !
Why do we reach that conclusion ?
Those passages point to new heavens and a new earth that will benefit Christians on a global scale .
Pointedly , the Bible foretells that God will eliminate wickedness and other causes of suffering and that he will then further bless mankind in his promised new system .
Why should we conclude that Isaiah 66 : 22 - 24 will have a fulfillment in coming days ?
( b ) What is the import of the prophecy that Jehovah’s servants will worship “ from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath ” ?
We can see from Isa 66 verse 22 that Jehovah knows that the new heavens and the new earth will not be temporary , of limited duration .
The graphic language Isaiah used may seem shocking .
Revelation 21 : 4 tells us of some things that will not exist in the coming new system .
Can we get any reliable hints ?
God will remove him .
He will die “ as a mere boy ” compared to having endless life . ​ — 1 Timothy 1 : 19 , 20 ; 2 Timothy 2 : 16 - 19 .
If you have not yet gained building experience or done gardening , Isaiah’s prophecy suggests that an education awaits you .
Or will the local climate suggest a flat roof ​ — like one of those in the Middle East — ​ a roof where you can gather with your family for delightful meals and conversation ? ​ — Deuteronomy 22 : 8 ; Nehemiah 8 : 16 .
You will be able to do that over a long life ​ — “ like the days of a tree . ”
Do you know from experience the pain of ‘ bringing to birth for disturbance ’ ?
We need not list the range of problems children may have that bring disturbance to parents and others .
In contrast , Jehovah assures us that he will hear and respond to our needs , even anticipate them .
Peace will prevail among humans and will be matched by peace with the animals .
19 , 20 .
As mentioned earlier , humans are unable to foretell the future accurately , despite widespread concerns related to a new millennium .
What is the legacy I leave for the next generation ?
You can understand why that is the case with many .
They may seek to enjoy life through hobbies or exciting forms of recreation .
What common element do we find at Isaiah 65 : 25 and Isaiah 11 : 9 ?
It is not presumptuous to imagine living in God’s new world .

Questions From Readers
Three of the Gospels relate the complaint about Jesus ’ being anointed with costly oil .
Matthew notes : “ On seeing this the disciples became indignant ” and complained that the oil could have been sold and the funds given to the poor .
Mark’s account includes most of those details .
As to the complaint , Mark reports that “ there were some expressing indignation , ” and “ they were feeling great displeasure at her . ”
So the two accounts show that more than one apostle was involved in the complaining .
How did it start though ?
He names the woman ​ — Mary , sister of Martha and Lazarus .
We read : “ Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , who was about to betray him , said : ‘ Why was it this perfumed oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor people ? ’ ” ​ — John 12 : 2 - 8 .
Once Judas raised this complaint , some other apostles may have murmured assent at what seemed a valid point .
“ You are not to accept a bribe , for the bribe blinds clear - sighted men and can distort the words of righteous men . ” ​ — Exodus 23 : 8 .
Nevertheless , legislation has not succeeded in curbing corruption .
Millions of bribes change hands every day , and billions of people suffer the consequences .
Bribery runs especially rampant in the world of commerce .
Inevitably , the ones who suffer most from corruption and the economic devastation it spawns are the poor ​ — the ones who are rarely in a position to bribe anyone .
Many who observe that politicians , policemen , and judges seem to ignore corruption or even practice it themselves merely follow their example .
They have to demand bribes if they want to make a decent living .
The more material benefits they amass , the greedier those practicers of corruption become .
Jesus , however , was incorruptible , and he taught his followers to behave in a similar way .
Could Christ’s teachings be an effective tool for fighting corruption today ?
Instead of bribing Felix , Paul spoke to him frankly about “ righteousness and self - control . ”
“ We trust we have an honest conscience , ” he wrote to Jewish Christians , “ as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 18 .
The obvious first step in curbing corruption is to recognize that corruption is destructive and wrong , since it benefits the unscrupulous to the detriment of others .
James Foley , U.S . deputy secretary of state , said : “ We all recognize that the cost of bribery is high .
On December 17 , 1997 , 34 major countries signed a “ bribery convention ” that is designed to “ have a major impact on the global fight against corruption . ”
Bribes for winning business contracts in other countries , however , are just the tip of the corruption iceberg .
The fight against corruption is a moral one that cannot be won by legislation alone or by “ the sword ” of legal penalties .
King David likewise understood that Jehovah hates corruption , and he requested that God not count him among the sinners , “ whose right hand is full of bribery . ” ​ — Psalm 26 : 10 .
Justice ​ — especially when practiced from the highest official down — ​ brings stability , whereas corruption impoverishes a country .
Her own head ones judge merely for a bribe , and her own priests instruct just for a price , and her own prophets practice divination simply for money . . .
What can move a person to make such a change ?
“ The word of God is alive and exerts power , ” he wrote .
* “ My assignment was to extort protection money from wealthy businessmen , ” he explains .
“ I also enjoyed the money and the excitement that this life - style offered me .
People feared me , which gave me a sense of power .
I somehow felt that nobody could touch me and that I was above the law .
Passages such as this convinced me that those who want to lead a criminal life have no real future .
I am trying to live in harmony with Psalm 37 : 3 , which says : ‘ Trust in Jehovah and do good ; reside in the earth , and deal with faithfulness . ’ ”
And Jehovah promises those who long for a world free from corruption that shortly there will come “ new heavens and a new earth . . . and in these righteousness is to dwell . ” ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also upon earth . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 10 .
[ Footnotes ]
While a bribe is given to pervert justice or for other dishonest purposes , a tip is an expression of appreciation for services rendered .
This is explained in “ Questions From Readers ” in the October 1 , 1986 , issue of The Watchtower .
[ Picture on page 7 ]
With the Bible’s help , we can cultivate “ the new personality ” and shun corruption
“ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding . In all your ways take notice of him , and he himself will make your paths straight . ” ​ — PROVERBS 3 : 5 , 6 .
As never before , people have access to information on just about any subject .
What problems can result from access to a superabundance of information ?
Others acquire partial information about complex fields of knowledge and then view themselves as experts .
What warnings regarding the pursuit of human wisdom are found in the Bible ?
He said : “ Take a warning : To the making of many books there is no end , and much devotion to them is wearisome to the flesh . ”
Centuries later the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy : “ Guard what is laid up in trust with you , turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called ‘ knowledge . ’ For making a show of such knowledge some have deviated from the faith . ”
To protect our spirituality , it is vital that we train our perceptive powers so that we can identify harmful information and shun it .
A World Overpowered by Satan
What is one source of harmful ideas , and who is behind it ?
The secular world is a prolific source of harmful ideas .
Never should we view as acceptable or harmless entertainment that promotes harmful ideas . ​ — Psalm 119 : 37 .
Apostates can present yet another threat to our spirituality .
As a result , when sincere individuals do research on our beliefs , they may stumble across apostate propaganda .
In addition , apostates occasionally take part in television or radio programs .
Exposing ourselves to apostate teachings through the various means of modern communication is just as harmful as receiving the apostate himself into our homes .
( b ) How did some Christians fail to be firm in upholding godly teachings ?
Such a spirit resulted in needless conflicts .
Of those who caused these arguments , Paul wrote : “ If any man teaches other doctrine and does not assent to healthful words , those of our Lord Jesus Christ , nor to the teaching that accords with godly devotion , he is puffed up with pride , not understanding anything , but being mentally diseased over questionings and debates about words . From these things spring envy , strife , abusive speeches , wicked suspicions . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 3 , 4 .
Guarding Our Trust
Fight the fine fight of the faith , get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses . ”
Paul’s use of such phrases as “ fight the fine fight ” and “ get a firm hold ” makes it clear that we must actively and determinedly resist spiritually harmful influences .
( b ) How does the congregation deal with those who insist on promoting false teachings ?
Discernment is also vital on the part of elders when called upon to assist those who speak unwisely .
To protect the unity of the congregation , elders should be quick to address such problems .
He said : “ Brothers , even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it , you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness . ”
As fine ministers , let us firmly uphold godly teaching .
• How is Christian balance displayed when dealing with today’s superabundance of information ?
Christians can exchange ideas without becoming dogmatic
Hear What the Spirit Has to Say
THE island of Puerto Rico is the home of the world’s largest and most sensitive single - dish radio telescope .
But no such messages have ever been received .
Ironically , though , there are clear messages from outside the human realm that any of us can receive at any time ​ — without the use of sophisticated equipment .
The Bible record contains several accounts of occasions when messages of divine origin were made audible to human ears .
On three occasions , Jehovah’s own voice was heard .
God also spoke through human prophets , many of whom wrote down what he inspired them to say .
“ All Scripture Is Inspired ”
The principal instrument of communication between God and humans is the Bible .
It is as if God were behind us , speaking in our ear the words : “ This is the way . Walk in it . ”
The Bible is spirit - inspired and contains the thoughts of God .
The “ thoughts and intentions of the heart ” can change as time passes and as we are affected by our experiences in life ​ — both pleasant and difficult .
If we do not constantly study the Word of God , our thoughts , attitudes , and emotions will no longer be in harmony with godly principles .
What words of the apostle Paul help us to examine ourselves with regard to reading the Bible ?
How can we cultivate and deepen our desire to learn from Jehovah ?
He wrote : “ As newborn infants , form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word , that through it you may grow to salvation . ”
“ Food at the Proper Time ”
Such counsel may be general in nature so as to allow each one to make a personal application .
From time to time , we also receive counsel that deals with specific aspects of our conduct .
Still , Jehovah takes delight in using his human servants , though imperfect , to guide us in this time of the end .
Guidance From Our Conscience
It is part of our nature .
How can a Bible - trained conscience help us to follow the guidance of Jehovah’s spirit ?
Still , our conscience may sound a warning , cautioning us against a potentially harmful course .
On the other hand , by learning to rely on our trained Christian conscience , we can make good choices even when there is no specific direction in writing .
Happy Are Those Who Listen and Obey
Jehovah’s spirit will also embolden us to face difficult situations with wisdom and courage .
However , we need not always wait for others to bring matters to our attention .
If we know the wise course to follow and what adjustments we need to make in our attitude and conduct in order to please God , let us act .
• How can we benefit from a program of regular Bible reading ?
As a result , Joseph’s insight “ proved to be good in the eyes of Pharaoh and of all his servants . ” ​ — Genesis 41 : 37 .
Their good conduct has often ‘ proved to be good in the eyes of those who observe it , ’ as the following experiences from Zimbabwe illustrate .
She observed that the husband and wife had a very good relationship and that their children were obedient .
After considering information from the Knowledge book on the subject “ Building a Family That Honors God , ” she said to the woman : “ This is the ‘ magic ’ that my husband and I use to ‘ tame ’ each other , and that is why we love each other very much . ”
This involved balancing our clothes and shoes on our heads , navigating the river , and then getting dressed again on the other side .
“ The interested person’s neighbors were very impressed with our zeal .
One of the individuals who visited the pioneers ’ home during this two - week period was the religious leader .
Why would one of Jehovah’s Witnesses rate such a plaque ?
However , when governments try to force them to transgress God’s laws , they follow the example of Christ’s apostles , who said : “ We must obey God as ruler rather than men . ”
“ I Will March Around Your Altar , O Jehovah ”
“ I SHALL wash my hands in innocency itself , and I will march around your altar , O Jehovah . ”
* Still , David found great delight in the tabernacle with its altar , which was the center of pure worship in Israel . ​ — Psalm 26 : 8 .
Burnt offerings , communion sacrifices , and guilt offerings were made on the altar , and the annual Atonement Day featured sacrifices offered in behalf of the nation .
Although a king , he was not even allowed in the courtyard of the tabernacle .
[ Footnote ]
Pay Attention to God’s Prophetic Word for Our Day
In fact , he wants all of us to know that we are deep in “ the time of the end . ”
What vital news that is for the six billion people now living on earth !
A terrified prophet of God heard Gabriel say : “ Understand , O son of man , that the vision is for the time of the end . ” ​ — Daniel 8 : 17 .
Who have ‘ roved about ’ during the time of the end , and with what result ?
Much of what Daniel wrote was made secret and sealed up to human understanding for centuries .
The result ?
In its pages , a king threatens to execute his wise men because they cannot reveal and interpret his puzzling dream , but God’s prophet solves the puzzle .
During a festive celebration , hundreds behold a hand that writes mysterious words on a palace wall .
8 , 9 .
If such claims are true , that would raise serious questions about what the book of Daniel foretold regarding the time of the end .
However , critics assert that the book is a fraud .
Critics have challenged this point because Belshazzar’s name was found nowhere outside the Bible .
Even critics had to agree : This was the Belshazzar of the book of Daniel .
This is only one of many proofs that the writings of Daniel are truly authentic .
Learning that his father , Nabopolassar , had died , this young man named Nebuchadnezzar took the throne in 624 B.C.E .
And Nebuchadnezzar appears to have relied heavily on divination in planning his military moves .
Unfit to rule for seven years , he ate vegetation , just as Daniel had foretold .
Can you explain how its major fulfillment brings us right down to the time of the end ?
According to Daniel chapter 2 , the dream involved an immense image with a head of gold , breasts and arms of silver , belly and thighs of copper , legs of iron , and feet of iron mixed with clay .
Nebuchadnezzar headed a dynasty that ruled over the Babylonian Empire .
It was overthrown by Medo - Persia , represented by the image’s breasts and arms of silver .
In the fourth century B.C.E . , a young man played a significant role in the fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy .
In addition to the Roman Empire , what other world power was pictured by the iron legs of the dream image ?
In an effort to shatter true Christianity , Rome persecuted Jesus ’ disciples .
Then in his 70 ’ s , Daniel has “ a dream and visions of his head upon his bed . ”
How those visions frighten him !
What grotesque creatures !
‘ A thousand thousands minister to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand keep standing before him . ’
What questions may arise when we read the book of Daniel , and what publication can help to answer them ?
( b ) In what period are we living , and what should we do ?
JEHOVAH was the Source of the first prophecy ever recorded .
He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel . ”
The apostle Paul identified God’s promised Seed when he wrote : “ The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed .
It says , not : ‘ And to seeds , ’ as in the case of many such , but as in the case of one : ‘ And to your seed , ’ who is Christ . ”
The Seed of blessing came through his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob .
First - century Jews expected one person to come as the Messiah , or Christ .
The Messiah Appears !
( a ) How are we to understand the prophecy of the 70 weeks ?
“ Seventy weeks of years ” began in 455 B.C.E . when Persian King Artaxerxes I ‘ sent forth the word to rebuild Jerusalem . ’
Faith in God’s prophetic word makes it possible for us to identify the Messiah .
He was called out of Egypt , and babes were killed after his birth .
As foretold , he entered Jerusalem on the colt of an ass .
Who is the Ancient of Days , and how was the prophecy recorded at Daniel 7 : 9 - 14 fulfilled ?
What a wonderful prophecy relating to the enthronement of “ the Son of man , ” Jesus Christ , in the heavens in the year 1914 ! ​ — Matthew 16 : 13 .
( b ) How would you explain the fulfillment of Daniel 2 : 44 ?
With faith in Jehovah , the “ Revealer of secrets , ” the prophet disclosed the meaning of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of an immense image .
Jesus ’ transfiguration was a preview of what , and what impact did that vision have on Peter ?
Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John into a lofty mountain where he was transfigured before them .
Shortly after faithful dead anointed ones were resurrected into the heavenly “ paradise of God , ” the remnant of spiritual Israel on earth was liberated from “ Babylon the Great , ” the world empire of false religion .
Into it the multitudes of sheeplike associates of spiritual Israel are streaming right now , “ in the final part of the days . ” ​ — Isaiah 2 : 2 - 4 ; Zechariah 8 : 23 ; John 10 : 16 ; Revelation 7 : 9 .
Can you imagine ​ — no doctors , no medicines , no hospitals or mental institutions , no funerals .
What splendid prospects !
Well , in its Paradise fulfillment , Ezekiel’s prophecy suggests that all of Jehovah’s people will have a place , even the land being apportioned in a just and orderly way .
[ Footnotes ]
• What was the first prophecy , and who was the promised Seed ?
• What were some Messianic prophecies fulfilled in Jesus ?
WHAT does it mean to be a Christian ?
“ To accept Christ as Lord and Savior . ”
The urge to change Christian teachings to suit the spirit of the age has a long history , as we shall see .
How do God and Jesus Christ feel about such changes ?
Can the churches that sponsor teachings that are not rooted in Christ rightly call themselves Christian ?
Another dislikes the shape of the nose , so he has that changed .
It is an entirely different matter to change Bible teachings to suit popular thinking .
Yet , that is precisely what has happened .
Jesus taught that his rulership , or Kingdom , is a heavenly one that would , in due time , destroy all human rulerships and rule over the entire earth .
However , by the time of Roman Emperor Constantine in the fourth century , many professed Christians had become impatient waiting for Christ’s return and for the establishment of God’s Kingdom .
“ Prior to Constantine , ” says the book Europe ​ — A History , “ Christians had not sought to assume [ political ] power as a means of furthering their cause .
The refashioned Christianity became the official “ universal , ” or “ catholic , ” religion of the Roman Empire .
These “ profound differences ” even affected fundamental teachings about God and Christ .
Christ and his disciples taught that there is only “ one God the Father , ” distinguished by his personal name , Jehovah , which appears some 7,000 times in early Bible manuscripts .
But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma .
Jesus even demonstrated the Biblical teaching of the resurrection by raising people from the dead .
When Jesus resurrected him , Lazarus came out from the tomb a living , breathing human .
If that were the case , Jesus would hardly have done him a favor by resurrecting him ! ​ — John 11 : 39 , 43 , 44 .
The Jewish Encyclopedia explains : “ The belief that the soul continues its existence after the dissolution of the body is a matter of philosophical or theological speculation rather than of simple faith , and is accordingly nowhere expressly taught in Holy Scripture . ”
* Yet , the Bible plainly states that “ the wages sin pays is death ” ​ — not eternal torment .
In the minds of just and loving people , it is a repelling thought !
Disfiguring the “ Portrait ” in Modern Times
Sadly , “ the dominant ideology of the day ” still tends to win out .
Paul could have reasoned : ‘ Yes , God reduced Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes for gross sexual sins , but that was 2,000 years ago !
These “ myths , ” of which we have considered a few , are spiritually destructive , whereas the truth of God’s Word builds up , and it leads to everlasting life .
However , they would be overshadowed by a weedlike majority , who would promote themselves and their teachings as the true face of Christianity .
“ Hell ” is a translation of the Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word Hades , both of which simply mean “ the grave . ”
The new name did not alter the Christian way of life , which continued to be modeled on that of Christ . ​ — 1 Peter 2 : 21 .
Feelings of futility led him to drug abuse and alcoholism .
It was at these moments that he remembered what his mother had told him : “ God is love . ”
Eventually , Antônio drifted away and reverted to his old habits .
About this time , Antônio’s wife , Maria , started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
By mid - 1992 , Antônio decided that he too would like to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
When the police found some cocaine in Antônio’s possession , they started to beat him .
One policeman threw him down in the mud and placed a shotgun barrel close to his face .
“ Finish him off ! ”
The only good things he could remember were his family and Jehovah .
He prayed briefly , begging for Jehovah’s help .
For no apparent reason , the policemen left him .
Antônio then shared what he had learned from these books with other patients .
After Antônio left the clinic , he continued his study of the Bible with the Witnesses .
Keep Your “ Hope of Salvation ” Bright !
“ Have on . . . as a helmet the hope of salvation . ” ​ — 1 THESSALONIANS 5 : 8 .
How does “ the hope of salvation ” help in endurance ?
Similarly , for thousands of years , hope in “ the salvation of Jehovah ” has sustained men and women of faith in times of trouble , and this hope has never led to disappointment .
The apostle Paul likened “ the hope of salvation ” to “ the helmet ” of a Christian’s spiritual armor .
Yes , our being confident that God will save us protects our thinking faculties , helping us to keep our senses despite adversity , opposition , and temptation .
“ Hope respecting the future was not a characteristic of the pagan world , ” the world surrounding the first - century Christians , states The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia .
Yet , “ the hope of salvation ” is a basic element of true worship .
Paul put it this way : “ Without faith it is impossible to please him well , for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ”
On the One to be praised , Jehovah , I shall call , and from my enemies I shall be saved . ”
What hope for future life did pre - Christian servants of Jehovah entertain ?
In Jesus ’ day , many Jews hoped for everlasting life , but they refused to accept Jesus as the key to realizing their hope .
How , though , is a restoration to such conditions possible ?
Why ?
That God would provide a ransom for all mankind was foreshadowed by the animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law .
Jesus was the one whose sacrifice fulfilled those prophetic pictures .
Unlike all other men , Jesus was not condemned to die because of sin .
His question may have reflected the prevailing Jewish thinking of his time ​ — that God demands certain good works and that by performing enough of those works , one can earn salvation from God .
In answer to the man’s question , Jesus simply reminded him that he should obey God’s commandments .
Jesus said to him : “ One thing is missing about you : Go , sell what things you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven , and come be my follower . ”
The young man , however , went away grieved , “ for he was holding many possessions . ”
That is why Jehovah provided a ransom to cover our sins .
Doing so brings not only God’s approval but also great joy , for “ his commandments are not burdensome ” ; they are “ a refreshment . ”
“ Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith ”
Yet , sexual excesses and perversions , disrespect for authority , divisions , and doubts were taking a toll on the spirit of the first - century congregation .
To help them combat such tendencies , Jude urged fellow Christians to keep clearly in mind their objective : “ Beloved ones , by building up yourselves on your most holy faith , and praying with holy spirit , keep yourselves in God’s love , while you are waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view . ”
Jehovah God expects exemplary moral conduct on the part of those to whom he will grant salvation .
Rather , God will do so , as Paul told the Greeks in Athens : “ He has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed ” ​ — Jesus Christ .
A few verses later , Paul points out that faith does not come spontaneously ; rather , it “ follows the thing heard , ” that is , “ the word about Christ . ” ​ — Romans 10 : 13 , 14 , 17 ; Joel 2 : 32 .
When we engage in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work , we are doing just what the apostle Paul wrote about , this time quoting Isaiah : “ How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things ! ”
16 , 17 .
Paul understood this aspect of the commission .
He stated : “ In fact , Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words , ‘ I have appointed you as a light of nations , for you to be a salvation to the extremity of the earth . ’ ”
Maintain “ the Full Assurance of the Hope ”
How can we keep our “ hope of salvation ” bright ?
Let us also take to heart Peter’s exhortation : “ Brace up your minds for activity , keep your senses completely ; set your hope upon the undeserved kindness that is to be brought to you . ”
IN AN isolated village in northern Thailand , a married couple who are Jehovah’s Witnesses try their newly acquired language skills on members of a hill tribe .
“ It is difficult to describe the joy and satisfaction we have , working among these interesting people , ” explains the husband .
As Christians , do we not all hope to do the same ?
Each of us might ask , ‘ Am I using whatever time remains for this system to save myself and those who listen to me ?
The latter attitude is dangerous .
Even after being saved through the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E . , true Christians did not stop preaching or fall back into a secular way of life .
How have Jehovah’s Witnesses shown endurance in modern times ?
In modern times Jehovah’s Witnesses have also persevered in the Christian work , even though they have experienced vicious persecution .
Certainly not , for Jesus assured us : “ He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved , ” whether that proves to be the end of the old system or the end of one’s present life .
How can a positive attitude help us to start Bible studies ?
True , in some territories , few seem to want to learn about Jehovah .
Yvette , a pioneer in a territory that some had called fruitless , noticed that visitors to the area , who did not have such a negative attitude , started home Bible studies .
The pure message of the Bible is powerful , and Jesus said that sheeplike ones know the voice of the true Shepherd when they hear it .
You have to understand a subject yourself before you can teach it to others .
On the other hand , some students hesitate to question a teacher .
To that end , as a review of your study , you might ask him to explain a point to you in simple terms , as if he were explaining it to someone hearing it for the first time .
Help the Student to Become Jehovah’s Friend
You will accomplish this not only by your words but also by your example .
If he sees that your words and actions spring from a good relationship with Jehovah , he may be more motivated to cultivate such a relationship himself .
( a ) Why is it important that the student develop the right motive for serving Jehovah ?
While you have the opportunity , you can encourage him to draw ever closer to Jehovah by reading God’s Word every day and thinking about it .
How can parents help their children to stay on the path to salvation ?
A great number of the children of Christian parents are sincere and “ solid in the faith . ”
Are you giving your children these things ?
Christian parents must never assume that their children will automatically become Christians too .
Is there really only one true religion ?
Studying with your own children will allow you to know firsthand what is in their hearts and minds .
Are their expressions heartfelt or perfunctory ?
How can parents make the family study enjoyable and beneficial ?
I’m still working in the far corners of the field ! ”
One day soon , at just the right time , Jesus will come to execute God’s judgment on this system .
Do you hope to be among them , along with your children and Bible students ?
• What should be our attitude , since we do not know the exact time of God’s judgment ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
Acting out Bible stories , such as Solomon judging the two harlots , makes family studies enjoyable

“ Honor men of all sorts , have love for the whole association of brothers , be in fear of God , have honor for the king . ” ​ — 1 PETER 2 : 17 .
1 , 2 .
We are faced with a steady flow of news about corrupt government officials , greedy employers , incompetent teachers , and abusive parents .
It is out of respect for Jehovah that we honor human authorities .
Naturally , honoring Jehovah’s authority always comes first in our lives . ​ — Acts 5 : 29 .
When David had the ark of the covenant brought to Jerusalem , his wife Michal “ got to see King David leaping and dancing around before Jehovah ; and she began to despise him in her heart . ”
However , she voiced her feelings in sarcasm : “ How glorious the king of Israel made himself today when he uncovered himself today to the eyes of the slave girls of his servants , just as one of the empty - headed men uncovers himself outright ! ”
How did Jehovah view Korah’s disrespect for His anointed ?
King Saul , under whom he served , became jealous of David’s achievements and sought to kill him .
Have you ever felt the same way ​ — that you had done no wrong to a person in authority , yet he kept giving you a hard time ?
In the Christian era , we also find outstanding examples of those honoring God - given authorities .
I’ve already written a letter to the Galatians advising them to keep free from observing the Law .
In the long term , God’s will was done .
Do you show due respect for those in authority ?
Over a year later , the decision was rendered in their favor .
Their attitude won the respect of some observers to the extent that they too wanted to become Jehovah’s Witnesses !
How can you show respect for God - given authority in the family ?
Should wives with believing husbands give them any less honor than wives with unbelieving mates give theirs ?
What does showing honor to parents involve ?
How about you children ?
God’s Word commands : “ Children , be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord , for this is righteous : ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; which is the first command with a promise . ”
Honor Those Taking the Lead
As a result , some in the congregation may feel dissatisfied with the elders .
How should we react when we feel that something in the congregation is not handled just right , or at least so it seems ?
Without being critical , explain how you have been affected .
And if it appears that other corrective measures are needed , have confidence that Jehovah will guide the elders to do what is good and right . ​ — Galatians 6 : 10 ; 2 Thessalonians 3 : 13 .
However , there is yet another aspect to consider with regard to honoring and respecting those who are in authority .
Let us examine that in the next article .
• What good reason do we have for honoring those who have authority ?
A religious title such as “ Rabbi , ” which means “ Teacher , ” “ tends to engender pride and a sense of superiority in those who obtain it , and envy and a sense of inferiority in those who do not ; and the whole spirit and tendency of it is contrary to the ‘ simplicity that is in Christ , ’ ” noted the Bible scholar Albert Barnes .
The Example of Jehovah and of Jesus
How did Jehovah honor his spirit creatures ?
4 , 5 .
A psalmist sang : “ Who is like Jehovah our God , him who is making his dwelling on high ?
Why is Peter’s role at Pentecost 33 C.E . significant ?
Only 51 days later , Christ dignified the repentant apostle by letting him represent Jesus ’ 120 disciples on the day of Pentecost and use the first of “ the keys of the kingdom . ”
Husbands and parents do well to imitate Jehovah and Jesus Christ in exercising God - given authority .
Recall that Jehovah took time to reason with Abraham .
In lands where male authority is deeply entrenched , a husband must keep in mind that his wife may have to overcome a formidable barrier to express her innermost feelings .
He cherished them , taking into consideration their physical and spiritual limitations even before they voiced their needs .
A word of sincere appreciation goes a long way toward helping your wife to feel valued . ​ — Proverbs 31 : 28 .
Jehovah even pleaded with the Israelites : “ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . .
They should be able to appreciate that their parents do love them .
While paternal authority is assumed , the point being made is the father’s need to have regard for the dignity of the children by not making them angry because of his excessive harshness .
Show consideration by making older ones feel needed and appreciated .
‘ Rising up ’ may include sitting down and listening to them relate what they accomplished years ago .
Despite their busy schedule , caring elders take the initiative to approach the young ones , the family heads , the single mothers , the housewives , and the elderly , whether such ones are facing problems or not .
An observant elder who makes appreciative comments about what a brother or sister does is imitating Jehovah , who appreciates his earthly creatures .
Remember how Jehovah treated Abraham’s probing questions and Habakkuk’s cry of distress .
“ When someone offering counsel treats me with respect , I feel free to approach him , ” said one Witness .
It may take more time , but hearing out those who have taken false steps makes it easier for them to accept any needed counsel .
Our showing honor to others extends to those who may be in line to become our spiritual brothers in the future .
Jehovah “ does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance . ”
• How should you view fellow worshipers ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Are you content , at peace ?
UNHAPPILY , there are many things in the world that rob people of inner peace .
Often , though , the competitive life - style involved brings anxiety , not peace .
Could he ever find it ?
Then there was Marcelo .
These experiences illustrate some situations that can destroy peace of mind .
[ Footnote ]
That is what the individuals mentioned in the preceding article discovered .
But they had at least three things in common .
And third , all of them found the inner peace they wanted after they accepted a Bible study with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Why So Little Peace ?
Man has neither the wisdom nor the foresight to rule himself without help , and the only help that has real value comes from God .
Without divine guidance , man’s efforts to gain peace will always be frustrated by the activities of the unseen but very real ​ — and very powerful — ​ “ wicked one , ” Satan .
Who can disagree with that assessment ?
For one thing , they learned that the world situation will one day be different .
When God’s will is done on earth , humans will experience a quality of life never before seen .
At the end of his ministry , he said to his disciples : “ I leave you peace , I give you my peace . I do not give it to you the way that the world gives it .
He compared himself to a shepherd , and he likened his meek followers to sheep when he said : “ I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance .
How can we benefit from what Jesus did ?
Just as when he walked on earth those many years ago , he is still concerned about meek ones who long for peace of mind .
It is very important to know this . ”
I hope that many more will be blessed , as I was , by learning the truth about God and his Son . ”
And that is only a foretaste of the peace that they will enjoy in the future .
The righteous themselves will possess the earth , and they will reside forever upon it . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 11 , 29 .
Moreover , we can be sure that in the near future , God will bless obedient mankind with peace as never before .

What attitude do Christians strive to maintain as preachers of the good news ?
A YOUNG man is excited about a new job .
He is eager to do his best .
Still , it can be an ongoing struggle .
Paul’s positive attitude about his ministry is an excellent example for us .
He was not ashamed of the good news .
He had the right attitude and was eager to carry out his ministry .
Be aglow with the spirit . Slave for Jehovah . ” The Greek word translated “ loiter ” carries the thought of being “ sluggish , slothful . ”
It is natural that faithful servants of God experience discouragement from time to time .
( a ) How could the view of our fellowman affect us ?
( b ) What lofty view of our ministry is expressed at 2 Corinthians 2 : 17 ?
Rather than allowing such thinking to affect us , let us maintain the view that Jehovah and Jesus have toward our ministry .
What Do We Owe Our Neighbor ?
In order to have a proper attitude toward our ministry , we must have the right motive .
Why do we preach ?
Even when few listen to us , our faithfully proclaiming the message of salvation brings praise to Jehovah .
What impels us to tell others of the hope of salvation ?
Today , we feel the same love for and obligation toward our neighbor .
How does the Bible describe the world outside the Christian congregation ?
These statements and others like them are in harmony with the apostle John’s words : “ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 19 .
Regarding individuals outside the Christian congregation , what do we not do , and why not ?
Christians do not presume to prejudge how any individual will respond to the preaching work .
They do not have a basis for describing any individuals as goats .
They eventually became believers .
How can we “ form a longing ” for Bible knowledge , and how will such knowledge benefit our ministry ?
How can Christian meetings equip us to handle the word of the truth aright ?
Christian meetings build up our faith , help us form a longing for God’s Word , and train us to be eager proclaimers of the good news .
We Can Count on Jehovah’s Support
We are eager to fulfill this God - given responsibility whole - souled , to the best of our ability .
Jehovah offers us his spirit and equips us with “ the sword of the spirit , ” God’s Word .
With his help we can open our mouths “ with freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news . ”
• In what way should our desire to declare the good news be like “ a burning fire ” in our hearts ?
• In general , how should we view those who do not share our beliefs ?
To this day , whether we live in an agricultural society or not , sowing spiritual seed in this way is the most important work that Christians do .
Just as it is written : ‘ How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things ! ’ ”
Never has it been more important to press ahead with a positive attitude in fulfilling this God - given commission .
For that reason Jehovah’s Witnesses are fully immersed in the production and distribution of Bibles and Bible - study aids in 340 languages .
And almost six million Witnesses share in distributing this Bible literature around the world .
For example , he could have cleared up many of the medical misconceptions of his day , or he could have advanced human understanding in other sciences .
Yet , he made it clear very early in his ministry that his commission was that of preaching the good news .
Jesus alluded to himself as the Sower of Kingdom truth .
He spread seeds of good news at every opportunity .
Then Jesus made a remarkable promise .
He said : “ Look ! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ​ — Matthew 28 : 19 , 20 .
As Head of the Christian congregation , he is responsible before Jehovah for this worldwide work . ​ — Ephesians 1 : 22 , 23 ; Colossians 1 : 18 .
We too share that genuine interest in people .
But like the angels , we rejoice when even “ one sinner ” accepts the message of salvation .
How effective can the use of Bible - based publications be ?
The Work of the True God
How was an old magazine instrumental in helping one family to come to know Jehovah ?
Robert was particularly interested in an article on the subject of raising children .
Robert and Lila began to study the Bible regularly with the Witnesses , and eventually they got baptized .
They , in turn , sowed seeds of truth in their children and reaped bountifully .
What moved a couple in Puerto Rico to develop an interest in the Bible ?
Some 40 years ago , William and Ada , a married couple from Puerto Rico , had no interest in studying the Bible .
Since then , they have helped more than 50 individuals to become part of our Christian brotherhood .
Karl was only 11 years old and somewhat mischievous .
The paper was an invitation to a public lecture on the subject of hell , sponsored by the Bible Students , known today as Jehovah’s Witnesses .
About a year later , after several sessions of Bible study , Karl was baptized , thereby becoming one of the Bible Students .
In 1925 he was invited to work at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — where he still serves .
These and many similar experiences illustrate the potential for good that our literature may have after it leaves our hands .
We Have Been Entrusted With a Treasure
That treasure is the God - given commission to preach , and the earthen vessels are the humans to whom Jehovah has entrusted this treasure .
What will we encounter as we sow seeds of Kingdom truth , and why should we nevertheless maintain a positive attitude ?
There are areas where most people seem extremely apathetic , even hostile .
May we never forget that , although we are the ones who plant and water the seeds , it is Jehovah who makes them grow .
Yet , just as Jesus and the angels accomplish their part of the work , Jehovah expects us to accomplish our ministry fully .
• How are Jesus Christ and the angels involved in the evangelizing work today ?
• Why should we be generous as sowers of Kingdom truth ?
Faith in God’s provision for raising the dead by means of his Son , Jesus Christ , can sustain us in times of stress .
Likely , our resurrection hope will be strengthened as we consider restorations to life recorded in the Bible .
In a thrilling review of the faith displayed by Jehovah’s pre - Christian witnesses , the apostle Paul wrote : “ Women received their dead by resurrection . ”
When the child later died , Elijah laid him on a couch , prayed , stretched himself upon the boy three times , and pleaded : “ O Jehovah my God , please , cause the soul of this child to come back within him . ”
What miracle did Elisha perform in Shunem ?
We read : “ As [ certain Israelites ] were burying a man , why , here they saw [ a Moabite ] marauding band .
Jesus told her : “ Stop weeping . ”
Then he touched the bier and said : “ Young man , I say to you , Get up ! ”
She was indeed dead , but Jesus was about to show that people can be raised to life just as they can be awakened from a deep sleep .
Taking the girl by the hand , he said : “ Girl , get up ! ”
What did Jesus do at the tomb of Lazarus ?
After praying publicly so that observers would know that he depended on God - given power , Jesus said in a loud voice : “ Lazarus , come on out ! ”
And out he came !
His hands and feet were still bound with burial wrappings , and his face was covered with a cloth .
Other Resurrections Strengthen Our Hope
When Jesus sent his apostles out as Kingdom preachers , he said : “ Raise up dead persons . ”
At Joppa in 36 C.E . , the godly woman Dorcas ( Tabitha ) fell asleep in death .
What was the last resurrection of Bible record ?
When Paul stopped there on his third missionary trip , he prolonged his discourse until midnight .
When on trial before Roman Governor Felix , Paul testified : “ I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets ; and I have hope toward God . . . that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous . ”
God himself alluded to a resurrection when he gave the first prophecy in Eden .
If that Seed was to bruise the serpent’s head thereafter , Christ would have to be raised from the dead .
Jesus declared : “ That the dead are raised up even Moses disclosed , in the account about the thornbush , when he calls Jehovah ‘ the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob . ’
Paul’s resurrection hope was in harmony with “ things set forth in the Law . ”
On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , the apostle Peter quoted from Psalm 16 : 8 - 11 , saying : “ David says respecting [ Christ ] , ‘ I had Jehovah constantly before my eyes ; because he is at my right hand that I may never be shaken . On this account my heart became cheerful and my tongue rejoiced greatly . Moreover , even my flesh will reside in hope ; because you will not leave my soul in Hades , neither will you allow your loyal one to see corruption . ’ ”
When did Peter quote from Psalm 118 : 22 , and how was this associated with Jesus ’ death and resurrection ?
Furthermore , there is no salvation in anyone else , for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved . ” ​ — Acts 4 : 10 - 12 .
Peter here quoted from Psalm 118 : 22 , applying what it said to Jesus ’ death and resurrection .
What hope did Job express , as recorded at Job 14 : 13 - 15 , and how can this comfort bereaved ones today ?
How have some expressed their confidence in the resurrection hope ?
• What incidents recorded in the Scriptures give us reason for hope in the resurrection ?
“ I have taken the loss of all things . . . so as to know [ Jesus Christ ] and the power of his resurrection . ” ​ — PHILIPPIANS 3 : 8 - 10 .
( b ) How will the resurrection take place ?
He said that the resurrection will consist of regathering and revivifying all the bones and flesh that ever made up a human body , whether it was destroyed by fire or by accident , was eaten by a beast or became fertilizer .
Jehovah , the God of resurrection , does not need to reassemble atoms of matter that originally constituted a human body .
He can fashion new bodies for those resurrected .
It strengthens us to endure trials and even to face death as faithful Witnesses of Jehovah .
But false teachers linked with the congregation in Corinth denied the resurrection .
In fact , the resurrected Jesus appeared to Cephas ( Peter ) , “ then to the twelve . ”
He was seen by some 500 , perhaps when he commanded : ‘ Go , make disciples . ’
What was Paul’s line of reasoning as recorded at 1 Corinthians 15 : 12 - 19 ?
Moreover , “ if in this life only we have hoped in Christ , we are of all men most to be pitied . ”
( b ) What is “ the last enemy , ” and how will it be brought to nothing ?
Inasmuch as Christ is “ the firstfruits ” of those asleep in death , others too would be resurrected .
Those belonging to him were to be raised during his presence .
This type of baptism begins when God’s spirit engenders the heavenly hope in them and ends when they are raised from death to immortal spirit life in heaven . ​ — Romans 6 : 3 - 5 ; 8 : 16 , 17 ; 1 Corinthians 6 : 14 .
Of what can Christians be sure even if Satan and his servants should kill them ?
As Paul’s words indicate , the resurrection hope enables Christians to stand in jeopardy hourly and to face death daily for doing the Kingdom - preaching work .
They know that Jehovah can resurrect them if he permits Satan and his servants to kill them .
While he was in Ephesus , his foes may have thrown him into the arena to fight wild beasts .
This will keep alive our resurrection hope .
Paul next dealt with certain questions .
What is meant by the expressions “ heavenly bodies ” and “ earthly bodies ” ?
He said : “ It is sown in corruption , it is raised up in incorruption . ”
Finishing their earthly course in faithfulness during Jesus ’ presence , they would “ be changed , in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye . ”
But because of Jesus ’ sacrifice and resurrection , death inherited from sinful Adam will no longer be victorious . ​ — Romans 5 : 12 ; 6 : 23 .
Their labors as Kingdom proclaimers are not in vain , for a resurrection awaits them .
He was absolutely certain that Jesus was raised from the dead and that others would also be released from mankind’s common grave .
Paul considered selfish advantages “ a lot of refuse ” and ‘ took the loss of all things ’ so that he might ‘ know Christ and the power of his resurrection . ’
The apostle was willing to submit to a death like that of Christ in the hope of receiving “ the earlier resurrection . ”
Also called “ the first resurrection , ” it is experienced by Jesus ’ 144,000 anointed followers .
What a blessing it will be when Abraham and Sarah , Isaac and Rebekah ​ — yes and so many others , including “ all the prophets ” — ​ are raised to life on earth !
Why should we not delay in doing good things for others ?
But above all , may we be thankful to Jehovah , who has made victory over death possible through our Lord Jesus Christ !
• In the case of anointed Christians , what is sown and what is raised up ?
[ Picture on page 16 ]
Respect for Authority ​ — Why Lacking ?
A spokesman for the National Association of Head Teachers in Britain is quoted as stating : “ The public are saying ‘ I have got rights , ’ rather than ‘ I have got responsibilities . ’ ”
Sociologist Mikhail Topalov endorsed this sentiment : “ These kids are not stupid .
But how far does such respect go ?
Paul was a Roman citizen , and Rome was the world power at that time .
In that sense the superior authorities have a relative position within the framework of God’s purpose .
He knows that by subjecting himself to the superior authorities and paying due taxes , not only is he upholding the standard of the community in which he lives but he is also living in harmony with divine requirements .
When a man follows the example of Jesus and exercises headship in a loving way , he will earn the “ deep respect ” of his wife .
*
These words , uttered by Jehovah God himself , endorsed Jesus as one who speaks with divine authority .
These “ gifts in men ” are Christian elders , who are appointed by holy spirit and are given the authority to care for the spiritual interests of fellow believers . ​ — Acts 20 : 28 .
For this reason Paul counsels : “ Remember those who are taking the lead among you , who have spoken the word of God to you , and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith . ”
Hymenaeus and Philetus are mentioned as men who subverted the faith of some and whose empty speeches ‘ violated what is holy . ’
The same is true today in the Christian congregation , which is described as “ a pillar and support of the truth . ”
Respect for authority is essential for our well - being physically , emotionally , and spiritually .

LEBANON has been noted for its natural resources since Bible times .
Likewise today , Lebanon continues to bear fruit that is very precious in Jehovah’s eyes .
Soon the principal arrived , and Wissam started over .
It turned out that this teacher had a copy of the Creation book and had been using it to deliver lectures at the university !
One day her cousin gave her a Bible and introduced her to the Pentecostal Church .
Six years later , Jehovah’s Witnesses called at Nina’s home and told her about God’s Kingdom .
However , she found that all their answers were logical and based on the Bible .
She dedicated her life to God and got baptized .

An ambitious prince concocts a devious scheme to usurp his father’s throne .
It has even ensnared some servants of Jehovah and led them to their ruin .
An examination of some of these will help us to see the danger of overstepping due bounds .
* “ That is enough of you , ” they said to Moses and Aaron , “ because the whole assembly are all of them holy and Jehovah is in their midst . Why , then , should you lift yourselves up above the congregation of Jehovah ? ” ​ — Numbers 16 : 1 - 3 .
Hence , when Moses confronted Korah , he was , in effect , asking , Do you view your assignment as something so trivial that you must also secure the priesthood ?
( b ) How was Korah’s rebellion brought to a disastrous end ?
The rest , including Korah , were consumed by fire from God .
Or we could become like the first - century Christian named Diotrephes .
He was highly critical of apostolic authority , evidently because he wanted to be in charge .
Of course , it is not wrong for a Christian man to reach out for congregation responsibilities .
Who was Absalom , and how did he attempt to curry the favor of those coming to the king for judgment ?
Absalom was determined to usurp his father’s kingship .
He had his kingship proclaimed throughout the land . ​ — 2 Samuel 15 : 10 .
Absalom had smooth lips .
He spoke swelling things to those whose favor he needed ​ — all to acquire a coveted position of authority .
When God’s prophet Samuel spoke favorably of him , Saul humbly replied : “ Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel , and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ?
* Remember , though , that Jehovah can read hearts and perceive our innermost motives .
Guard Against Impatience
18 , 19 . ( a ) Describe how impatience can cause a modern - day servant of God to act presumptuously . ( b ) What should we remember about the operation of the Christian congregation ?
The account of Saul’s presumptuous act has been recorded in God’s Word for our benefit .
He is punctual , up - to - date on congregation procedures , and gifted in speaking and teaching .
Should he criticize his brothers , perhaps implying that were it not for his efforts nothing would get done and the congregation would falter ?
[ Footnotes ]
Since Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn , those of his descendants who were swayed by Korah to rebel might have resented that Moses ​ — a descendant of Levi — ​ had administrative authority over them .
Hence , to be deprived of a burial was calamitous and was often an expression of God’s disfavor . ​ — Jeremiah 25 : 32 , 33 .
Do You Recall ?
• How can we avoid the impatient spirit manifested by Saul ?
A courageous Israelite judge calls himself the smallest in his father’s house .
Each of these men displays modesty .
In what way is wisdom “ with the modest ones ” ?
The modest person is wise because he follows a course that God approves , and he avoids a presumptuous spirit that results in dishonor .
In addition , Jehovah blessed Paul with visions and the gift of speaking in foreign tongues .
When visiting them , he did not present himself “ with an extravagance of speech or of wisdom . ”
Instead , Paul said regarding himself and his companions : “ Let a man so appraise us as being subordinates of Christ and stewards of sacred secrets of God . ”
Paul set a fine example for Christians today .
No matter what responsibilities have been entrusted to us , none of us should feel that we are superior to others .
As was true in Paul’s case , it is only by undeserved kindness that humans can come into a relationship with God at all , much less serve him in some privileged capacity . ​ — Romans 3 : 12 , 24 .
When giving counsel or direction , he does so as a fellow worker ​ — not as a master .
Certainly , it would be wrong for one who excels in certain tasks to solicit praise from or exploit the admiration of fellow believers .
When we are entrusted with a measure of responsibility , modesty will help us to avoid putting undue emphasis on ourselves , creating the impression that the congregation is thriving solely because of our efforts and abilities .
Are you not encouraged when you see , for example , the single parent who regularly comes to the Kingdom Hall with children in tow ?
These individuals may not be in the limelight .
Gideon ​ — “ The Smallest ” in His Father’s House
In what way did Gideon show modesty in speaking with God’s angel ?
The angel clarified matters and told Gideon : “ You will certainly save Israel out of Midian’s palm . ”
What modesty ! ​ — Judges 6 : 11 - 15 .
Before sending Gideon into battle , Jehovah tested him .
H .
Macmillan , who finished his earthly course in 1966 , set a fine example in this regard .
C .
Russell , the first president of the Watch Tower Society , once asked Brother Macmillan for his thoughts on who might take charge of the work in his absence .
“ I stood there half dazed , ” Brother Macmillan wrote years later .
This is the Lord’s work and the only position you get in the Lord’s organization is what the Lord sees fit to give you ; and I am sure I’m not the man for the job . ”
Like Gideon , he had a modest view of himself ​ — a view we do well to adopt .
How did Jesus show that he had a modest view of himself ?
Thus , although Jesus was perfect , he was not a perfectionist .
Modesty will also move us to be reasonable in our expectations of others and to be considerate of their needs .
[ Footnotes ]
On the contrary , his courage is confirmed by Hebrews 11 : 32 - 38 , which includes Gideon among those who “ were made powerful ” and who “ became valiant in war . ”
• What is modesty ?
• How can we imitate Paul’s modesty ?
• How did Jesus set the supreme example of modesty ?
Gideon used discretion in carrying out God’s will
Sacrifices That Pleased God
Relief from these is needed .
Next , we find that Noah , preserved by God through the great Flood that destroyed the wicked generation of his day , was moved “ to offer burnt offerings upon the altar ” to Jehovah .
On several occasions , God’s faithful servant and friend Abraham , moved by God’s promises and blessings , ‘ built an altar and called on the name of Jehovah . ’
Later , Abraham met the greatest test of his faith when he was told by Jehovah to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering .
These accounts , though brief , shed much light on the subject of sacrifice , as we shall see .
What role do sacrifices play in worship ?
Why Is Sacrifice Needed ?
When Adam sinned , he did so deliberately .
His taking and eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad was an intentional act of disobedience .
The penalty for that disobedient act was death , as God had clearly stated : “ In the day you eat from it you will positively die . ”
Adam and Eve eventually reaped the wages of sin ​ — they perished . ​ — Genesis 3 : 19 ; 5 : 3 - 5 .
When Eve gave birth to her firstborn son , Cain , she proclaimed : “ I have produced a man with the aid of Jehovah . ”
Was she thinking that perhaps her son would turn out to be the Seed ?
On the other hand , his brother Abel showed faith in God’s promise and was moved to offer some firstlings of his flock as a sacrifice to Jehovah .
Similarly , many of the offerings prescribed by the Law can be viewed as “ gifts ” to God to seek his acceptance and favor .
Where in the Bible can we find an overview of the sacrifices , or offerings , in the Law ?
Among the offerings made voluntarily as gifts or as an approach to God to gain his favor were the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and communion offerings .
Some scholars hold that the Hebrew term for “ burnt offering ” means “ an offering of ascent ” or “ an ascending offering . ”
It was a voluntary offering consisting of fine flour , usually moistened with oil , with frankincense added .
“ The priest must grasp from it his handful of its fine flour and its oil along with all its frankincense ; and he must make it smoke as a remembrancer of it upon the altar , as an offering made by fire of a restful odor to Jehovah . ”
Although these sacrifices also involved burning on the altar , they differed from the burnt offering in that the entire animal was not offered to God , only the fat and certain portions of it .
The rest of the animal was disposed of outside the camp or in some cases partaken of by the priests .
Interestingly , a burnt offering was usually preceded by a sin offering or a guilt offering , suggesting that to make a sinner’s gift acceptable to God , forgiveness of sin was needed . ​ — Leviticus 8 : 14 , 18 ; 9 : 2 , 3 ; 16 : 3 , 5 .
Some were private sins , some were sins against “ the holy things of Jehovah ” , and some , though not entirely unwitting , were sins that resulted from wrong desires or fleshly weaknesses .
What happened in 70 C.E . as far as the Law and its sacrifices are concerned ?
In 70 C.E . , the Jewish system of things , with its temple and priesthood , came to its end .
A Hebrew word frequently translated “ offering ” is qor·banʹ .
• What principal types of sacrifices were offered under the Law , and what were their purposes ?
There , in one bold statement , the apostle Paul affirms that all the sacrifices offered under the Mosaic Law were of no permanent value as far as man’s salvation is concerned . ​ — Colossians 2 : 16 , 17 .
The question , then , is , What “ instruction ” and “ comfort ” can we glean from that body of information in the Law regarding offerings and sacrifices ?
Though not required to offer literal sacrifices in the manner stipulated by the Law , we are still very much in need of what the sacrifices did to a degree for the Israelites , namely , to have our sins forgiven and to enjoy God’s favor .
Quoting from Psalm 40 : 6 - 8 , Paul points out that Jesus did not come to perpetuate the “ sacrifice and offering , ” the “ whole burnt offerings and sin offering , ” all of which by the time of Paul’s writing no longer had God’s approval .
Rather , Jesus came with a body prepared by his heavenly Father , one that corresponded in every respect to the one God prepared when He created Adam .
What superior way of approach to God is available to Christians ?
Hence , while the Israelites had a temporary means of approach to God by their sacrifices , Christians have a superior basis for coming to God ​ — the sacrifice of Jesus Christ .
If we exercise faith in the ransom sacrifice provided by God and obey Him , we too can have our sins forgiven and enjoy God’s favor and blessing .
Is that not a source of comfort ?
How , though , can we demonstrate that we have faith in the ransom sacrifice ?
If those conditions were met , “ it [ was to ] be graciously accepted for him to make atonement for him . ”
When the sacrifices ​ — animal or grain — ​ were offered on the altar , salt , a preservative , was added . ​ — Leviticus 2 : 11 - 13 .
The Law stated that anyone coming before Jehovah had to be clean and undefiled .
All of this draws attention to one fact : Jehovah is holy , and he does not condone or approve of sin or corruption of any kind .
In view of this , we ought to scrutinize ourselves in all areas of life to be sure that our service to Jehovah is acceptable to him .
12 , 13 .
Do you willingly spend your time and energy in teaching interested ones and helping them to become disciples of Jesus Christ ?
Our zealous participation in the ministry , like the restful odor of a burnt offering , is well - pleasing to God . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 58 .
The term “ communion offerings ” is sometimes translated “ peace offerings . ”
Regarding the communion sacrifice , one scholar observes : “ This was , indeed , a season of happy fellowship with the Covenant God , in which He condescended to become Israel’s Guest at the sacrificial meal , even as He was always their Host . ”
What makes Christian meetings particularly joyous is that we not only receive instruction but also offer praise to Jehovah .
“ Praise Jah , you people ! ”
How Would You Answer ?
• What can we offer that is comparable to a voluntary burnt offering ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
For our service to be acceptable to Jehovah , we must be free from defilement of any kind
Isaiah chapter 53 contains a famous Messianic prophecy .
It is easy to see why a question might arise about Isaiah 53 : 10 .
Isaiah 53 : 10 reads : “ Jehovah himself took delight in crushing him ; he made him sick .
Jesus knew in advance that the noble course that he would take would involve some agony .
Therefore a voice came out of heaven : ‘ I both glorified it and will glorify it again . ’ ” ​ — John 12 : 27 , 28 ; Matthew 26 : 38 , 39 .
In that sense Jehovah “ took delight in crushing , ” or the crushing of , the Messiah .
How can one’s life be affected by one’s attitude ?
How do we learn attitudes ?
The previously mentioned encyclopedia notes : “ We learn or absorb , as if by osmosis , the attitudes of those with whom we are closely associated . ”
Who was exemplary with regard to his attitude , and how can we imitate him ?
He said : “ I set the pattern for you , that , just as I did to you , you should do also . ”
* We study Jesus ’ life with the intention of doing what the apostle Peter recommended : “ To this course you were called , because even Christ suffered for you , leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely . ”
4 , 5 .
As Christians , we likewise want to reach out to serve others , including “ those not strong . ”
He knew that opposition from an unbelieving and uncomprehending world can be expected by those who try to please their neighbor “ in what is good for his upbuilding . ”
Jesus demonstrated a proper attitude in other ways .
Paul encourages us to imitate these aspects of Jesus ’ attitude when he says : “ Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus , who , although he was existing in God’s form , gave no consideration to a seizure , namely , that he should be equal to God . No , but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men . ” ​ — Philippians 2 : 5 - 7 .
I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within , but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members . ”
Correcting Faulty Attitudes
Let us , then , as many of us as are mature , be of this mental attitude . ” ​ — Philippians 3 : 12 - 15 .
In what ways does Jehovah reveal a proper mental attitude to us ?
Paul’s words show that anyone who , having become a Christian , does not feel the need to make progress has a wrong attitude .
Paul goes on to say : “ If you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect , God will reveal the above attitude to you . ” ​ — Philippians 3 : 15 .
Prayerful study of God’s Word with the help of Christian publications provided by “ the faithful and discreet slave ” will enable those “ mentally inclined otherwise ” to develop a proper attitude .
Christian elders , appointed by holy spirit “ to shepherd the congregation of God , ” will be happy to offer support .
Let us accept it .
Yet , he was inclined to justify himself .
Jehovah directed Elihu to assist Job in rectifying this inclination .
May we avoid trying to justify ourselves , remembering that no matter what our privileges may be in Jehovah’s service , we are still only “ good - for - nothing slaves . ” ​ — Luke 17 : 10 .
Did all have a wrong attitude ?
The record continues : “ Therefore Jesus said to the twelve : ‘ You do not want to go also , do you ? ’
Simon Peter answered him : ‘ Lord , whom shall we go away to ? ’ ”
When confronted with explanations or refinements in understanding of the Scriptures that we may at first find difficult to accept , would it not be good to display the attitude shown by Peter ?
How foolish it would be to stop serving Jehovah or to speak in a manner contrary to “ the pattern of healthful words ” simply because some things are initially difficult to understand ! ​ — 2 Timothy 1 : 13 .
Their solution ?
“ From that day on they took counsel to kill him . ”
Jehovah’s servants maintain a positive attitude .
Jesus likewise refused to be intimidated by his enemies .
• Describe the mental attitude of Jesus Christ .
A Christian with the right attitude reaches out to help others
[ Picture on page 9 ]
Despite living in difficult times , Jeremiah displayed a positive attitude .
Even when he witnessed the horrors of Jerusalem’s fall in 607 B.C.E . , he could see positive things .
Jeremiah wrote in the book of Lamentations : “ It is the acts of loving - kindness of Jehovah that we have not come to our finish , because his mercies will certainly not come to an end .
Throughout history , servants of God in the most difficult circumstances have sought to maintain a positive , even joyful , attitude . ​ — 2 Corinthians 7 : 4 ; 1 Thessalonians 1 : 6 ; James 1 : 2 .
Adopt a Waiting Attitude
If we cultivate a mental attitude like that of Jesus , we will not lose the joy of Jehovah even if things do not always happen as and when we expect them to .
In many ways .
How will a waiting attitude help someone struggling with a personal problem ?
In what way will a waiting attitude help our view of a progressively refined understanding of the Bible ?
Remember , Jehovah saw fit to reveal “ the sacred secret of the Christ ” a little at a time and over a period of some 4,000 years .
Do we , then , have any reason to be impatient ?
Some may be discouraged because they feel that after many years of faithful service , they may not live to see “ the great and fear - inspiring day of Jehovah . ”
Still , they can be encouraged when they look at the positive aspect .
Thus , we are encouraged to do what we can , patiently waiting until circumstances change ​ — either in this system of things or in that which is to come .
What ungodly trait can be avoided by one with a waiting attitude ?
Some who have become apostate were unwilling to wait .
Yet , they failed to acknowledge that Jehovah’s spirit moves the faithful and discreet slave to make adjustments in His due time , not when we may feel that this is needed .
Into these very things angels are desiring to peer . ”
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step . ”
To acknowledge that Jeremiah’s words are true is not defeatist .
What realistic view do Jehovah’s Witnesses have of what can be accomplished by humans ?
The book suggested that most obstacles can be overcome if they are approached with a positive attitude .
How does the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses improve individuals ?
Such reformed individuals have learned to provide for their families in a responsible and honest way .
By being law - abiding citizens themselves and by helping others to change their lives for the better , Jehovah’s Witnesses lessen the load of agencies whose work it is to deal with social problems .
But he did not remove the problem of sickness or conquer the enemy death .
It seems that some of his contemporaries wanted him to take power and act in this way , but Jesus declined .
He wrote : “ Expectation postponed is making the heart sick . ”
In these times of ecological crisis , they relish the certain prospect of seeing Paradise established on earth .
Encourage fellow believers .
Can You Explain ?
• How did Jesus show a waiting attitude ?
Jesus endured for the joy that was set before him

Our Precious Heritage ​ — What Does It Mean to You ?
What sort of things have people received as an inheritance ?
What heritage did Jehovah originally make possible for the offspring of Adam and Eve , and why did they not receive it ?
He provided the garden of Eden as a sample of what the entire globe could become and set before our first parents a wonderful , challenging assignment .
Their offspring would share in this .
They owed Jehovah love and obedience , but Adam and Eve failed to appreciate what God had given them and disobeyed his commandment .
Therefore , they could not pass these on to their offspring . ​ — Genesis 2 : 16 , 17 ; 3 : 1 - 24 .
How can we obtain the heritage that Adam forfeited ?
An Inheritance Passed On Through Abraham
He was willing to serve Jehovah wherever and however God directed so that his offspring could receive their inheritance .
Because Abraham did not withhold even his son , Jehovah declared : “ By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves . ”
But they all had confidence in Jehovah .
So one day when Esau was hungry , he sold his right as firstborn to his brother , Jacob .
For what ?
In exchange for one meal of bread and lentil stew !
The nation through which God’s promises to Abraham would be fulfilled descended from Jacob , whose name was changed by God to Israel .
At Mount Sinai , what further extraordinary developments took place in connection with the inheritance of the sons of Israel ?
What a spiritual heritage that new nation had !
They worshiped the only true God .
The Messianic Seed was to appear in their nation .
Why ?
But they did not appreciate their precious heritage .
14 , 15 . ( a ) Following Jesus ’ death , how did the nations begin to bless themselves by means of the “ seed ” of Abraham ?
Before his death , Jesus introduced to prospective Jewish members of that new nation the new covenant , which would be validated by his own blood .
As a secondary part of the spiritual seed of Abraham , they will share in bringing the blessing of life in perfection to people of all nations .
What a precious inheritance they have ! ​ — Ephesians 1 : 16 - 18 .
What aspects of their heritage do anointed Christians enjoy while still on earth ?
Joyfully , these blessed ones likewise render sacred service to Jehovah and recognize that their salvation is dependent on faith in the Lamb of God , Jesus Christ .
It will be a world in which “ death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ”
The righteous themselves will possess the earth , and they will reside forever upon it . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 3 , 4 , 10 , 11 , 29 .
Jesus ’ “ other sheep ” have an inheritance in the earthly realm of the heavenly Kingdom .
It is through the collective body of anointed , “ the faithful and discreet slave , ” that the other sheep have had opened to them an understanding of the precious promises contained in God’s Word .
Together , they thank God for the sin - atoning value of Jesus ’ sacrifice .
They serve together as one flock under one Shepherd , Jesus Christ .
How can all of us show that we cherish our spiritual heritage ?
Is your appreciation of it strong enough to fortify you to resist any temptation to pursue a course that might lead to forfeiting it ?
May all of us cherish the spiritual heritage that God has given us .
Abraham’s offspring received the promise of a precious inheritance
Do you appreciate your spiritual heritage ?
Half - truths and misinformation have been used by their opponents to misrepresent them before the public .
Jean Bonhomme , a medical doctor and former member of Parliament , sent an open letter to a local newspaper .
He wrote : “ From time to time , Jehovah’s Witnesses come to my home .
They express themselves mildly and listen kindly to my skepticism . ”
Bonhomme said : “ Otherworldliness , in their case , can hardly do any harm .
On the other hand , the otherworldliness of certain politicians is much more of a threat to the peace of citizens and the harmony of society . ”
However , a much more interesting phenomenon is occurring among the people of Chile .
The following experiences illustrate the fine results that are being achieved by this method of witnessing .
She did so and finally decided to try making a call .
A telephone operator answered , and Karina explained the purpose of the call .
During one of their conversations , she read to him a portion of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life .
She asked around , but no one in Yerevan , Armenia , where she lived could tell her who Jehovah is ​ — not her parents , not her teachers , not even the ministers at the local church .
Silvia grew up , finished school , and got a job , but she still did not know who Jehovah is .
One of her roommates received regular visitors .
She was warmly welcomed at the branch and was finally able to have her own Bible study .
From successive refugee centers , Silvia had to locate Jehovah’s Witnesses and start her Bible study over and over again .
Silvia is now 26 years old and serves in the place that reminded her of paradise , the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Denmark .
she now remarks .
“ THE Son of man came , not to be ministered to , but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many , ” Jesus Christ told his apostles .
He also knew how much time he had to fulfill his mission .
His ministry on earth as the Messiah was to be only three and a half years long .
Hence , Jesus ’ entire course of action on earth was essentially governed by two factors : the purpose of his coming and a keen sense of timing .
Near the end of his ministry , he used the expression “ the hour has come . ”
They have all now come to the village of Cana in the district of Galilee to attend a wedding feast .
Just a few weeks earlier , he was baptized , anointed with holy spirit , and introduced by John the Baptizer as “ the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world . ”
Now his direction must necessarily come from the Supreme Authority who sent him .
What determination to do his Father’s will is expressed in Jesus ’ answer to Mary !
May we be similarly determined to fulfill our “ whole obligation ” to God . ​ — Ecclesiastes 12 : 13 .
What miracle does Jesus Christ perform in Cana , and what effect does it have on others ?
This occurs as an introduction to Jesus ’ miracle - working power , giving a sign that God’s spirit is upon him .
Soon it is the spring of 30 C.E . , and Jesus and his companions are on their way to Jerusalem to observe the Passover .
Greedy Jewish merchants are selling animals and birds for sacrifices right inside the temple .
He makes a whip of ropes and drives the sellers away .
As they travel through the district of Samaria , Jesus seizes an opportunity to give a thorough witness to a Samaritan woman .
In Galilee , Jesus commences an even greater ministry than in Judea and Jerusalem .
His challenging words : “ Repent , you people , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near , ” ring out in the entire district .
‘ Good talk concerning Jesus spreads out through all the surrounding country , ’ and great crowds flock to him ​ — from Galilee , Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and the other side of the Jordan River .
However , not all of Jesus ’ hearers are receptive .
The “ hour ” of his death has not yet come . ​ — Luke 4 : 16 - 30 .
( a ) Why do some religious leaders come to hear Jesus ?
( b ) Why is Jesus accused of breaking the Sabbath ?
Religious leaders ​ — scribes , Pharisees , Sadducees and others — ​ are also often present where Jesus preaches .
Many of them are there , not to listen and learn , but to find fault and try to entrap him .
Now the Jews charge him with blasphemy for claiming to be God’s Son by calling him Father .
What an extensive witness to the truth is given in Galilee ! ​ — Matthew 4 : 18 - 25 ; Luke 8 : 1 - 3 ; 9 : 1 - 6 .
13 , 14 . ( a ) On what occasion are the Jews seeking to get hold of Jesus ?
The Festival of Tabernacles is near .
Jesus , though , is aware of the danger .
Delaying in Galilee for some time , Jesus goes up to Jerusalem “ not openly but as in secret . ”
They go in advance to every place and city into which Jesus , accompanied by his apostles , is planning to go . ​ — Luke 10 : 1 - 24 .
While Jesus is walking in the temple colonnade , they encircle him .
“ This sickness is not with death as its object , ” answers Jesus , “ but is for the glory of God , in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it . ”
He knows exactly what he must do and why . ​ — John 11 : 1 - 10 .
Jesus asks .
Not understanding what Jesus intends to do , Martha objects : “ Lord , by now he must smell , for it is four days . ”
Lazarus comes out with his feet and hands still bound with burial wrappings and his face covered with a cloth .
“ Loose him and let him go , ” says Jesus . ​ — John 11 : 41 - 44 .
How Would You Answer ?
• What can we learn from the way Jesus often dealt with opposers ?
“ His hour had come for him to move out of this world to the Father . ” ​ — JOHN 13 : 1 .
As the Festival of the Passover nears , many people go from the country into Jerusalem , and the city is buzzing with speculations about Jesus .
“ What is your opinion ? ”
On Nisan 8 , six days before the Passover , Jesus is back in the vicinity of Jerusalem .
For you have the poor always with you , but me you will not have always . ”
What a marvelous example this provides for us as we eagerly await the end of this system of things !
On Sunday , Nisan 9 , Jesus comes to Jerusalem triumphantly .
“ Blessed is the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name ! ”
they cry . Some Pharisees in the crowd want Jesus to rebuke his disciples .
Now these keep telling others about that miracle .
When the chief priests and the scribes see this and they hear the boys in the temple crying out , “ Save , we pray , the Son of David ! ”
“ Did you never read this , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise ’ ? ”
And he always took measures to get away safely when his life was threatened .
It was also not Jesus ’ custom to advertise himself as the Messiah .
7 , 8 .
The merchants in the temple are now referred to as “ robbers . ”
Yet , they do not know how to eliminate Jesus , since all the people , being astounded at his teaching , are hanging onto him to hear him . ​ — Mark 11 : 18 ; Luke 19 : 47 , 48 .
What lesson does Jesus teach , and what invitation does he extend to his listeners at the temple ?
But what awaits Jesus cannot be avoided .
The Day for Denunciations
The answers Jesus gives silence them . ​ — Matthew 21 : 23 – 22 : 46 .
What advice does Jesus give his listeners concerning the scribes and the Pharisees ?
Since the scribes and the Pharisees profess to teach God’s Law , Jesus now urges his listeners : “ All the things they tell you , do and observe , but do not do according to their deeds , for they say but do not perform . ”
But Jesus is not through with them .
What scathing denunciations does Jesus pronounce against the scribes and Pharisees ?
The significance of these prophetic words reaches down to our time .
( a ) During the Passover on Nisan 14 , what lesson does Jesus teach the 12 ?
( b ) What commemoration does Jesus institute after dismissing Judas Iscariot ?
For the next two days ​ — Nisan 12 and 13 — ​ Jesus does not openly show himself at the temple .
Rather than scolding them , Jesus patiently teaches them about the value of ministering to others .
Why is Jesus in agony in the garden of Gethsemane ?
The agony of this anticipated experience and how it may bring reproach upon his Father is so intense that while Jesus prays , his sweat becomes as drops of blood falling to the ground .
“ Look ! My betrayer has drawn near . ”
The Son of Man Glorified !
• How may we imitate Christ Jesus in our ministry ?
Said the inspired psalmist : “ The law of Jehovah is perfect , bringing back the soul .
The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy , making the inexperienced one wise .
Speaking in anticipation of the time when the nation of Israel would have a human king , Jehovah said : “ It must occur that when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom , he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law from that which is in the charge of the priests , the Levites .
What did the Governing Body recently write to Branch Committee members regarding Bible reading , and why would all Christian elders do well to follow such counsel ?
Christian elders today have a very busy schedule , making daily Bible reading a challenge .
Daily reading of the Scriptures will help them to “ act wisely . ”
Young and old , native and alien resident , needed to have engraved , as it were , in their hearts and minds what conduct would bring Jehovah’s blessing and what would bring his disapproval .
Today , millions of Jehovah’s servants are like those “ alien residents ” in a spiritual sense .
They constantly need to remind themselves of Jehovah’s standards of good and bad .
Daily reading of God’s Word helps them to do this . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 ; James 1 : 25 .
There are also many “ little ones ” among Jehovah’s people who have been taught Jehovah’s standards by their parents but who need to convince themselves of the rightness of his will .
( b ) What did the founding editor of this magazine state with regard to Bible study aids ?
Wise King Solomon wrote : “ Take a warning : To the making of many books there is no end , and much devotion to them is wearisome to the flesh . ”
One might add that the reading of many books published today is not only wearisome to the flesh but , frankly , dangerous to the mind .
The present Bible - reading program covers the entire Bible in a period of about seven years .
This schedule is beneficial for all but particularly so for new ones who have never read the Bible in its entirety .
Those who attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead for missionaries and the Ministerial Training School as well as new members of the Bethel family are required to read the whole Bible in one year .
Remember what Moses wrote ​ — and Jesus repeated — ​ that “ man must live , not on bread alone , but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth . ”
12 , 13 . ( a ) How does the apostle Peter illustrate the longing we should have for God’s Word ?
Paul , on the other hand , uses the need for milk to illustrate the poor feeding habits on the part of some who claim to be spiritual adults .
For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness , for he is a babe .
The Bible’s Author , Jehovah , offers you that privilege .
So before opening your Bible , ask Jehovah to help you recognize points in your reading that need to be applied in your personal life .
If the point is still not clear , make a note to do further research later .
Review Questions

Elders , in particular , need to read the Bible daily
Study ​ — Rewarding and Enjoyable
If the material is wholesome , reading can be a source of healthy relaxation .
Solid food must be masticated before being swallowed and digested .
Making Study a Pleasure
Developing a Fondness for God’s Word
I have longed for your salvation , O Jehovah , and your law I am fond of . ” ​ — Psalm 119 : 16 , 24 , 47 , 77 , 174 .
The progression is : rejoice , meditate , delight in . . .
This combination may suggest that purposeful reflection is the means by which one comes to take delight in the word of Yahweh . . . .
*
We should muse over deep spiritual thoughts , become absorbed in them , and meditate on them .
This requires quiet reflection and prayer .
We should follow his example .
( c ) Why is it important for us to consider the study of the Bible as “ an act of worship ” ?
The psalmist states that he showed concern for Jehovah’s laws , commandments , and reminders .
He sings : “ With your orders I will concern myself , and I will look to your paths . . . .
All day long it is my concern .
Considering the study of God’s Word as a part of our worship adds seriousness to it .
Study is a part of our worship and is done to improve our worship .
How does Jehovah reveal deep spiritual thoughts to his people ?
The slave class diligently provides spiritual nourishment for all ​ — “ milk ” for new ones but “ solid food ” for “ mature people . ” ​ — Hebrews 5 : 11 - 14 .
Give an example of “ deep things of God ” that have been explained by the slave class .
For example , fine material has been published that shows how Jehovah can at once be just and merciful .
How should we show appreciation for “ the grand sum ” of spiritual truths revealed thus far ?
He wrote : “ My son , if you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself , so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear , that you may incline your heart to discernment ; if , moreover , you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself , if you keep seeking for it as for silver , and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it , in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah , and you will find the very knowledge of God .
Similarly , when we begin a study period , we should select in our personal library the study tools we will need .
Remembering that study is work and requires mental effort , it is also good to adopt an appropriate posture .
After concentrating for a while , you might find it beneficial to do some stretching or go outside for some fresh air .
In some languages , this Bible is printed in a larger edition , known as the Reference Bible .
It does take time , however , and you are probably thinking , ‘ Where can I find the time to do justice to my Bible reading and personal study ? ’

• What fine study tools has Jehovah provided ?
[ Pictures on page 17 ]
IT HAS been said that “ to choose time is to save time . ”
A person who allots a specific amount of time to things that need to be done will often get more out of his time .
( a ) In his Sermon on the Mount , what did Jesus say about our spiritual need ?
( b ) What self - examination would be in order ?
You may realize how important this is , but you may feel that you just do not have time to study or to read the Bible .
If so , let us examine ways and means of making more room in our life for reading God’s Word , for personal study , and for meditation .
( b ) What did Paul mean when he counseled us to ‘ buy out the opportune time for ourselves ’ ?
In view of the times we live in , all of us need to take heed of the apostle Paul’s words : “ Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons , buying out the opportune time for yourselves , because the days are wicked .
Many of Jehovah’s servants today seem to have difficulty fitting Bible reading and deep study into their lives .
In Greek , the phrase “ buying out the opportune time ” implies buying at the expense of something else .

Why and how should we “ make sure of the more important things ” ?
So if our Bible reading and study habits leave much to be desired , it would be good to make a personal analysis to see how our time is spent .
What are the advantages of following the advice given in the booklet Examining the Scriptures Daily ​ — 1999 ?
*
She says : “ I am deeply motivated , and I stick to my reading schedule come what may ! ”
*
“ Food Supplies at the Proper Time ”
It has been as if we collectively have heard a voice saying to us : “ ‘ This is the way . Walk in it , you people , ’ in case you people should go to the right or in case you should go to the left . ”
It is essential to have a regular schedule for Bible reading and personal study and to stick to it .
However , the Bible shows that we need to be reminded of things already learned .
We are helped to measure up to one of our basic Christian responsibilities , namely , that we may individually become “ a workman with nothing to be ashamed of , handling the word of the truth aright . ”
The more we read and study the Bible , the more our minds will be filled with God’s thoughts .
Our skill in teaching will be enhanced , and our conversations , talks , and counsel will be more upbuilding spiritually . ​ — Proverbs 1 : 5 .
• What is revealed by the way we use our time ?
Balancing other activities in our busy life with spiritual pursuits brings rich dividends
Should You Investigate Other Religions ?
I thought that such programs could help me to understand people of other religions better .
When asked about the potential dangers of such exposure to false teachings , he would answer : “ Nothing could undermine the faith of one who knows Bible truth . ”
These experiences raise an important question , Is it wise to listen to what others believe ?
Recognizing True Christianity
Foreseeing this , Jesus disclosed one way to distinguish these counterfeit forms of Christianity from true Christianity .
First , he warned : “ Be on the watch for the false prophets that come to you in sheep’s covering , but inside they are ravenous wolves . ”
Following Jesus ’ example , they stand apart from the world’s politics and social controversies .
They make God’s name known .
Instead , they treat one another as brothers . ​ — Luke 4 : 43 ; 10 : 1 - 9 ; John 13 : 34 , 35 ; 17 : 16 , 17 , 26 .
True worshipers today are united in thought and deed , just as the first - century Christians were .
Beware of False Teachers
He once began a discourse by saying : “ Men of Athens , I behold that in all things you seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are .
For instance , while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration I also found an altar on which had been inscribed ‘ To an Unknown God . ’ ”
Paul , however , did not regularly feed his mind on the philosophies of Greek orators .
Or ‘ are we inciting Jehovah to jealousy ’ ? ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 10 : 20 - 22 .
This should not surprise us .
After speaking of “ the faithful and discreet slave ” that represents the body of anointed Christians , Jesus spoke of the “ evil slave , ” a class that complains , “ my master is delaying , ” and starts to beat its fellow slaves .
“ The kingdom . . . will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ” ​ — DANIEL 2 : 44 .
What confidence can we have in the Bible ?
The apostle Paul wrote : “ When you received God’s word , which you heard from us , you accepted it , not as the word of men , but , just as it truthfully is , as the word of God . ”
The Bible contains what we need to know about God : information about his personality , his purposes , and his requirements for us .
Of paramount importance in the Bible is its theme : the vindication of God’s sovereignty ( his right to rule ) by means of his heavenly Kingdom .
Why is God’s Kingdom of immediate importance to us ?
The prophecy at Daniel 2 : 44 states : “ In the days of those kings [ now ruling on earth ] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [ a government in heaven ] that will never be brought to ruin .
“ He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation ; because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth . ”
God’s Word says of earth’s new Ruler : “ To him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom , that the peoples , national groups and languages should all serve even him . ”
Because Jesus will imitate God’s love , great will be the peace and happiness under his rule .
How is Matthew 24 : 14 being fulfilled today ?
There , people come to learn of the incoming new government .
Associate Rulers
Jehovah himself was their Ruler , and as long as they obeyed him , there was no need for any other rulership .
Genesis chapter 1 shows that Jehovah , likely through his firstborn heavenly Son , dealt with Adam and Eve .
The account uses such expressions as “ God said to them ” and “ God went on to say ” to them . ​ — Genesis 1 : 28 , 29 ; John 1 : 1 .
Everything in the garden of Eden was absolutely perfect .
There would have been no need for a new heavenly government .
As perfect mankind multiplied , why would God still have been able to communicate with them ?
As the human family multiplied , how would God communicate with all of them ?
They are grouped together in island universes called galaxies .
Others contain about a trillion .
What a marvelous arrangement ​ — to have Jehovah as Ruler , to have direct access to him , and to have the prospect of never dying , living forever on a paradise earth !
Independence from Jehovah’s rule would , without fail , result in selfishness , hate , cruelty , violence , wars , and death .
Sadly , our first parents decided that they did not need God as their Ruler , and they chose to live independently from him .
“ The Rock [ Jehovah ] , perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice . . . .
For thousands of years , people have tried every form of human government , every economic and social system .
The 20th century proved that .
Why would Jehovah let humans go their own way ?
So freedom was not to be absolute , as that would result in anarchy .
By letting the human family go its own way , God has , once and for all time , demonstrated that we need his rulership .
His way of ruling , his sovereignty , is the only right way .
This is because our minds and bodies were designed by Jehovah to work best when in harmony with his laws .
How is God’s purpose to be fulfilled by the Kingdom ?
But during that time , how will the superiority of Jehovah’s way of ruling be demonstrated ?
The following article will consider these questions .
• What is the theme of the Bible ?
• How must free will be exercised ?
[ Picture on page 10 ]
National Archives photo ; concentration camp : Oświęcim Museum ; child : UN PHOTO 186156 / ​ J .
During all that time , God’s will was not being done on earth in general .
What will mark the transition from human rule to Kingdom rule ?
Marking this transition will be the period of time that Jesus called the “ great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now , no , nor will occur again . ”
Thus , Jehovah is fully justified in bringing this wicked system to its end .
Likely he was referring to Psalm 37 : 29 , which foretold : “ The righteous themselves will possess the earth , and they will reside forever upon it . ”
What bad things will no longer exist under Kingdom rule ?
“ They will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears .
And they will actually sit , each one under his vine and under his fig tree , and there will be no one making them tremble . ” ​ — Ezekiel 34 : 25 - 28 ; Micah 4 : 3 , 4 .
Sickness , sorrow , and even death will be eliminated .
When he resurrected a 12 - year - old girl , her parents “ were beside themselves with great ecstasy . ”
The rule of God through his Kingdom will have been shown to be completely superior in every respect .
The Bible shows that “ Satan will be let loose out of his prison . ”
No , they will be like perfect Adam and Eve , who willingly chose to rebel against Jehovah’s righteous rule . ​ — Revelation 20 : 7 - 10 ; Nahum 1 : 9 .
On the other hand , likely the vast majority of people will choose to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty .
Hence , Romans 8 : 21 will be fulfilled : “ The creation itself [ humankind ] also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God . ”
What a wonderful prospect awaits faithful ones , to know that God will forever shower down on them an overflow of spiritual and material benefits !
How did Jesus show that it was proper to be sustained by our hope ?
Thus , looking forward to the reward is a vital help in enduring as a Christian .
“ Next , the end , when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father , when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power .
For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 24 , 25 .
When Christ hands over the Kingdom to God , how are the scriptures to be understood that speak of it as lasting forever ?
Yet , we can be certain that Jehovah will give them many further privileges of service throughout his creation .
What conditions will exist in the new world ?
He was bemoaning recent cases of gross dishonesty by public officials that made the headlines .
“ Moral standards have been lost through greed , ” he said .
Moral values that are rooted in God’s Word , the Bible , and that have long been widely accepted as a guide for what is right and what is wrong are being pushed aside .
Is Bible Morality Relevant ?
A lady who noted the social changes in Germany in the past few years wrote of her concern : “ Marriage is now regarded as old - fashioned and out - of - date .
On the other hand , millions consider the moral standards taught in the Bible to be trustworthy and relevant to life in our modern world .
A married couple living on the Swiss - German border discovered that learning to live according to Bible morals made them happier .
That guideline is the Bible . ”
Is that the case ?
Stick to Your Mate
Their union was the first marriage in history and was to be an enduring relationship .
People were asked what factors are important for a good marriage .
Or does the Bible standard of sticking faithfully to one’s mate still make good sense ?
But hastily ending a marriage without a very serious reason or in order to take another mate reveals a selfish disregard for others .
Why not ?
Doris plunged into depression , and the two of them discussed divorce .
Sticking faithfully to a marriage mate demands strength of character and love of principle .
He is fair in his dealings with others ​ — straightforward , honorable , not deceptive or misleading .
Honest people contribute to a climate of trust and confidence , which leads to healthy attitudes and promotes strong human relationships .
Despite widespread corruption and cheating ​ — or maybe because of it — ​ honest individuals are generally admired by others .
Christine was taught to steal from the time she was 12 years of age .
Employers prefer workers who do not cheat .
Do we not respect politicians , policemen , and judges who shun corruption ?
The peaceful family unit is where adults and children have the best opportunity to feel emotionally secure .
Think of how much everyone would benefit if there were no abandoned mates , divorce courts , or child - custody cases .
[ Blurb on page 5 ]
1 , 2 . ( a ) How do people in general view sexual morality ?
What have many in Christendom been taught about sexual relations , and how does that compare with what the Bible teaches ?
In contrast with today’s secular world , some in Christendom have taught that sexual relations are shameful , sinful , and that the “ original sin ” in the garden of Eden was the sexual seduction of Adam by Eve .
The Bible record refers to the first human couple as “ the man and his wife . ”
The Bible is quite specific on this matter .
Later , Jesus included “ fornications ” and “ adulteries ” with the “ injurious reasonings ” that originate in the heart and defile a person .
The apostle Paul was inspired to admonish the Christians in Corinth : “ Flee from fornication . ”
And in his letter to the Hebrews , Paul wrote : “ Let marriage be honorable among all , and the marriage bed be without defilement , for God will judge fornicators and adulterers . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 4 .
Yet , if we obey God’s direction , we benefit greatly .
It likewise promotes in us a healthy , positive attitude toward sex that will contribute to happiness in marriage .
Wrote one Christian woman : “ The truth of God’s Word is the best protection there is .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Maintain your conduct fine among the nations , that , in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers , they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection . ”
One regulation regarding military encampments required that excrement be buried outside the camp .
Perhaps the Israelites wondered about the reason for such direction ; some may have thought it unnecessary .
Similarly , there are spiritual , social , emotional , physical , and psychological reasons why God has limited sexual relations to the marriage bed .
Let us now consider a few Bible examples of those who maintained moral cleanness .
He attracted the attention of Potiphar’s wife , who tried to seduce him .
Why did Joseph reason as he did ? ​ — Genesis 39 : 1 - 9 .
Joseph’s family lived far away , and his father thought he was dead .
If Joseph engaged in sexual immorality , his family would never know of it .
Such a sin could probably also be concealed from Potiphar and his male servants , since there were times when they were not in the house .
Doubtless he knew what Jehovah had proclaimed in the garden of Eden : “ That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh . ”
Jehovah told that king : “ Here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken , since she is owned by another owner as his wife . . . .
Well , as a slave , he had duties to perform and could do little to change his situation .
Archaeological evidence suggests that the design of Egyptian houses made it necessary to pass through the main part of the home to reach the storerooms .
Thus , through good times as well as hard times , Job showed moral integrity .
Jehovah observed this and blessed him richly .
Jehovah’s altar was covered with the tears of abandoned wives , and God condemned those who thus “ dealt treacherously ” with their mates . ​ — Malachi 2 : 13 - 16 .
How was the Shulammite like “ a garden barred in ” ?
Solomon , though rejected by her , was inspired to record her story .
In moral integrity , the Shulammite set an excellent example for Christian women today .
Jehovah saw and appreciated the virtue of the Shulammite girl and blessed her just as he blessed Joseph and Job .
Let us never forget that Jehovah is “ paying attention ” and rejoices as we loyally strive to keep morally clean . ​ — Malachi 3 : 16 .
We have a higher morality , a godly morality .
See The Watchtower , March 15 , 1983 , pages 29 - 31 .
Sadly , there are situations in which an innocent Christian acquires a sexually transmitted disease from an unbelieving mate who has not followed God’s direction .
• What is covered by the word “ fornication ” in the Bible ?
• How do we benefit by remaining morally clean ?
You Can Remain Morally Clean
It involves understanding the reasons why immorality is condemned and how we benefit by shunning it .
We have learned that he knows what is best for us .
( b ) What should we avoid ?
We do this by being selective in what we watch and read and in the music we listen to .
Remember , imperfect humans can easily fall into immorality .
To maintain moral cleanness , we must fill our minds with godly wisdom . ​ — James 3 : 17 .
Each step taken makes it increasingly difficult to turn back .
In the twilight hours , his “ heart ” has directed him , not to just any street , but to one where he knows a prostitute can usually be found .
“ By the smoothness of her lips she seduces him . ”
This expression tells us that his thoughts , desires , affections , emotions , and goals in life were not in harmony with what God approves .
Learning From the Sins of David
Sadly , though , even outstanding servants of God have become involved in sexual immorality .
David was then middle - aged , possibly in his early 50 ’ s .
David had her brought to his palace and had relations with her .
But Uriah did not go to his home .
The child ​ — a son — ​ was born .
The Bible says : “ The thing that David had done appeared bad in the eyes of Jehovah . ”
Jehovah sent the prophet Nathan , who skillfully confronted David with what he had done .
Rather , he showed the attitude described at Psalm 141 : 5 : “ Should the righteous one strike me , it would be a loving - kindness ; and should he reprove me , it would be oil upon the head , which my head would not want to refuse . ”
Enduring the Consequences of Sin
Because David was a man of integrity , because he was merciful to others , and because his repentance was genuine .
If we have remained morally clean , may we continue in that course by taking advantage of all the provisions that Jehovah has made to assist us .
By maintaining moral chasteness , we will be benefited now and forever .
Having this advance knowledge , be on your guard that you may not be led away with them by the error of the law - defying people and fall from your own steadfastness . ” ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 14 , 17 .
• Why can it be difficult to remain morally clean ?
• What are some ways to support our determination to follow high moral standards ?
• What lessons can we learn from the sins of the young man mentioned by Solomon ?
[ Pictures on page 16 , 17 ]
World Peace ​ — How ?
The authors reflect on the hopeful spirit that prevailed a mere decade ago .
At what seemed to be the dawn of a new era , many expected that mankind would begin to make significant headway in tackling poverty , illness , and environmental issues .
Students of the Bible realize that man’s efforts , no matter how noble , can never fully succeed .
Why not ?
Because , as the Bible states , “ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
Yes , by means of God’s Kingdom , our globe will be transformed into a peaceful , happy home , where life and work will be a constant joy for all obedient mankind .
Furthermore , God promises to “ wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ”
Would You Welcome a Visit ?
“ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ” ​ — ACTS 20 : 35 .
We can be sure that in the year 2000 , me - ism is by no means dead .
How many times do you hear the questions , “ What is in it for me ? ”
In a similar way , true worship is characterized by giving that is based on love .
Since we love Jehovah and we love our fellow believers , it is a delight to serve them , to give of ourselves to them .
But those who serve unselfishly , being more concerned with what they can give than with what they hope to receive , find happiness indeed .
5 , 6 . ( a ) What public service was performed in Israel , with what benefits ?
The apostle Paul used a Greek word related to lei·tour·giʹa with reference to Israel’s priests .
They taught God’s Law and offered sacrifices that covered the sins of the people .
Consequently he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him , because he is always alive to plead for them . ” ​ — Hebrews 7 : 24 , 25 .
Why does Jesus ’ public service bring unparalleled benefits ?
Jesus continues as priest forever , without successors .
He is “ a public servant [ lei·tour·gosʹ ] of the holy place and of the true tent , which Jehovah put up , and not man . ”
He uses his high authority to give , not to take .
How did Jesus perform a public service to replace the Law covenant ?
Yet , Christians on earth do perform public service , and they find great joy in doing so .
Our endeavoring to tell others about the fine qualities and beneficent purposes of our beloved heavenly Father certainly brings us great joy . ​ — Psalm 71 : 23 .
Only they can render him sacred service in the Holy compartment and the inner courtyard of Jehovah’s spiritual temple , and they look forward with eager anticipation to serving with Jesus in the Most Holy , heaven itself .
Their companions , the other sheep class , rejoice with them in their marvelous hope . ​ — Hebrews 6 : 19 , 20 ; 10 : 19 - 22 .
Where does the great crowd render sacred service , and how does this blessing affect them ?
Thus , the great crowd are seen “ standing before the throne and before the Lamb , dressed in white robes . ”
In a similar way , the great crowd worships Jehovah in the outer courtyard of his spiritual temple .
Sacred Service That Is Unacceptable
It is not up to us to determine the proper way to worship God .
Yet , they turned to other gods when they thought this would be to their advantage .
There are many people who claim to worship God , but their worship is really directed to the gods of nationalism , tribalism , wealth , self , or some other deity .
( a ) How do we view our sacred service ?
He was speaking to Satan , but how vital it is that all of us heed his words !
Doing this in behalf of our fellowman is a joyful work that brings great happiness .
Still , such service brings real happiness only if it is offered wholeheartedly and in the right way .
Who are really worshiping God properly ?
Christendom’s liturgies are generally either worship services or specific rituals , such as the Eucharist in the Roman Catholic Church .
Likely , this public ministering included preaching to the public .
( b ) Who is considered a minister in Christendom , and why are things different among Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
* For this , they graduate from colleges or seminaries and are ordained .
The New Encyclopædia Britannica says : “ In churches that have retained the historic episcopate , the ordaining minister is always a bishop .
Yet , this is not the case among Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Angels ministered to Jesus .
Man or woman , adult or child , a true disciple of Jesus Christ would be a minister . ​ — Joel 2 : 28 , 29 .
He did not have a certificate of ordination or a degree from some seminary to prove that he was a minister , and he was not ordained by any man .
By whom does a Christian minister become “ adequately qualified ” ?
Paul said : “ Our being adequately qualified issues from God , who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant . ”
How does Jehovah qualify his worshipers to be ministers ?
Thus Timothy was “ persuaded to believe . ”
For one thing , his faith was strengthened by association with Christians in nearby congregations .
And overseers visited them in order to build them up .
When was Timothy ordained as a minister , and why would you say that his spiritual progress did not end there ?
However , Timothy did not then rest on his laurels .
Today , how does someone “ rightly disposed for everlasting life ” make progress toward being a minister ?
He has presented his whole self “ a sacrifice living , holy , acceptable to God ” without reserve or condition .
But the central part of his ministry , as was the case with Jesus and Paul , was preaching the good news and making disciples .
It is sharing in this work that identifies one publicly as a genuine Christian minister .
The Attitude of a Christian Minister
Most of Christendom’s ministers expect to be given special respect , and they take such titles as “ reverend ” and “ father . ”
However , a Christian minister knows that Jehovah alone is worthy of reverence .
Even though its usage in relation to the Christian ministry is more elevated , a di·aʹko·nos is still a servant .
Genuine Christian ministers ​ — even those with special responsibilities in the congregation — ​ are humble slaves .
Hence , Christian ministers humbly serve Jehovah God and Jesus Christ .
How was Paul rewarded for enduring in the ministry ?
Because he endured , however , many accepted the good news and became ministers .
Yes , the almost six million ministers of Jehovah today can say with the apostle Paul : “ In every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers , by the endurance of much . ”
They are truly to be commended for their endurance .
As a result , the final ones of the 144,000 have been gathered , and millions more have the confident hope of enjoying everlasting life on a paradise earth .
• What responsibility did all first - century Christians share ?
• Why should a Christian minister endure in the face of difficulties ?
Timothy was taught God’s Word from infancy .

He became an ordained minister when he was baptized
Christian ministers are willing to serve
Moreover , Paul did all of this “ most gladly . ”
What about you ?
Are you willing to spend your time , energy , talents , and resources serving Jehovah God and the interests of others , even if doing so means being “ exhausted and worn out ” at times ?
Most individuals do not just hesitate to serve God but flatly refuse to do so .
Jehovah wants willing , wholehearted service .
In many lands today , mothers have a legal obligation to care for their children .
No .
Love motivates us to copy Paul’s example . ​ — Matthew 22 : 39 .
What was the result ?
Instead of giving Jehovah the best of their animals , however , people in Malachi’s day began to offer those they really did not want themselves .
How might this happen to any of us ?
Jesus found great happiness in willingly serving God .
By means of Jesus , Jehovah would ultimately crush Satan and remove the effects of his rebellion . ​ — Genesis 3 : 15 .
Even under the severest stress , Jesus never faltered in his willingness to submit to his Father’s will .
So even if we willingly serve God , it will not be easy for us to do so .
We too find that we cannot carry out completely all the good things we wish to do .
This is not because of any reluctance on our part .
Jehovah will reward and support such a willing spirit .
The Bible ​ — Cherished and Suppressed
The Bible’s opponents , however , fiercely rejected such an idea .
A recent study shows , though , that while the Bible is still highly regarded there , “ spending time reading it , studying it and applying it . . . is a thing of the past . ”
So how do most people deal with the increasingly complex and troubling issues in life ?
[ Picture on page 3 ]
From the book Deutsche Kulturgeschichte
“ THE word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword . . . and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart . ”
Then he added : “ When you take the issue of our longing and need for healing today and read the Bible in that light , astonishing results follow . ”
A Book That Gives Purpose
The Author of the Bible , Jehovah God , is ‘ familiar with all our ways . ’
It makes sense to seek to understand those limits and directions and learn to live by them .
Happy is the man whose “ delight is in the law of Jehovah , ” says the psalmist .
He admits that he was too clever in his own eyes to see the numerous examples in support of the Bible’s authenticity .
Unfortunately , I remained uninformed and ignorant to the beauty and veracity of the greatest book ever written . ”
“ It was a challenge , ” says Daniel , “ because we are so imperfect . ”
Now Daniel reads God’s Word every day , and it keeps him close to Jehovah .
Happiness eluded him .
He dreaded going to sleep at night , not knowing if he would wake up the next day .
Then he read what Jesus said about death and the resurrection : “ The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear [ Jesus ’ ] voice and come out . ”
His mother could not raise him on her own , so he was sent to live in many foster homes .
Eventually , he found what he was looking for through his study of the Bible .
Remember , Jehovah sees what is in our heart and knows what we are looking for .
George says : “ Personality conflicts or misunderstandings are among the most stressful situations in life . ”
How does he deal with them ?
When husband and wife disagree , both need to “ be swift about hearing , slow about speaking , slow about wrath . ”
Yes , the Bible teaches us how to acknowledge and deal with our own imperfections and how to have success in coping with those of others .
It will truly prove to be a textbook for living !
The Bible teaches you how to draw close to God
“ [ Jehovah ] is giving to the tired one power ; and to the one without dynamic energy he makes full might abound . ” ​ — ISAIAH 40 : 29 .
And what dynamic energy resides in the things he created !
* All life on our globe depends on the energy generated by atomic reactions on the sun .
And there are many other factors that drain us of strength .
The apostle Paul pointed out that the Christian ministry would require more than the normal power of imperfect humans .
He wrote : “ We have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves . ”
Jehovah helps us by means of his holy spirit , and thus our weakness magnifies his power .
With full faith and confidence , David therefore wrote : “ By God we shall gain vital energy , and he himself will tread down our adversaries . ”
Jehovah also energized Habakkuk so that he might complete his assignment as prophet .
Like David , Habakkuk , and Paul , we should exercise faith in God’s ability to strengthen us and in his power to save us .
Just as we must eat to maintain physical strength , we need to take in spiritual food provided by God through his Word and Christian publications to maintain our spiritual strength .
Therefore , meaningful study and meditation are essential .
The psalmist David ‘ meditated on God during the night watches . ’
Why should we attach great importance to regular prayer ?
May we therefore “ persevere in prayer . ”
Of course not .
Jesus said : “ Where there are two or three gathered together in my name , there I am in their midst . ”
How do fellow believers in our congregation prove to be “ a strengthening aid ” ?
The result ?
What suggestions are offered regarding home Bible studies ?
How glad we are to prepare well and make an extra effort to help others draw close to God !
Some years later he approached her , and soon her husband started a Bible study with him .
How can we demonstrate that we look to Jehovah for strength ?
We can do so by fully availing ourselves of the spiritual provisions he makes through the ‘ faithful slave . ’
How did the apostles Peter and Paul express the need for God - given strength ?
Despite our human frailty , Jehovah will strengthen us to do his will if we rely on him for aid .
May we display the same conviction and bring glory to the Sovereign Lord Jehovah , who empowers the tired one . ​ — Isaiah 12 : 2 .
• Why do Jehovah’s people need more than normal power ?
Our own relationship with Jehovah is strengthened as we use the Bible to teach others
How are God’s reminders related to happiness ?
On the basis of Psalm 119 : 60 , 61 , what confidence do we have ?
God’s reminders were dear to the psalmist who sang : “ I hurried up , and I did not delay to keep your commandments .
Jehovah’s reminders help us to endure persecution because we are confident that our heavenly Father can cut the ropes of restraint that enemies tie about us .
When God sees fit to remind us of things having to do with his laws , we are grateful for such direction .
Why We Need God’s Reminders
One reason why we need Jehovah’s reminders is that we are forgetful .
Why are God’s reminders needed today more than ever before ?
Without such reminders we would become ‘ forgetful hearers . ’
At the Public Meeting , speakers present instruction from God’s Word , including Jehovah’s reminders and Jesus ’ wonderful “ sayings of everlasting life . ”
How have God’s people in one Asian land manifested appreciation for Christian meetings ?
“ In 19 years , we have never missed a meeting .
The spiritually beneficial instruction received at these gatherings gives us clear evidence that our heavenly Father cares for his people .
They are no part of the world , just as I am no part of the world .
Let us continue to cherish God’s Word , which sets us apart for his sacred service .
Since we are living deep in the last days of this wicked system of things , let us keep praying for divine help so that we can continue to observe Jehovah’s reminders and thus ‘ keep on guard according to his word . ’ ​ — Psalm 119 : 9 .
Those “ rightly disposed for everlasting life ” will thus have evidence that the course set out in God’s Word is really the best one to pursue .
20 , 21 .
If we are to receive the undeserved gift of everlasting life , we must love Jehovah’s reminders exceedingly and observe them wholeheartedly .
And I will keep your reminders . ” Yes , by word and deed , let us prove that we really do love Jehovah’s reminders exceedingly .
Following Anna’s example , do you make it a point not to miss meetings ?
Heeding Jehovah’s reminders sets us apart as clean and acceptable for his service
1 , 2 .
True Christians are certain that their sharing with others a knowledge of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ constitutes the greatest help they can offer .
However , what about helping ones who are already serving God , who are following “ The Way ” ?
( a ) Under what circumstances did Paul write to the Colossians ?
One was the zealous evangelizer Epaphras from the city of Colossae in Phrygia , in the plateau country east of Ephesus in Asia Minor ( modern - day Turkey ) .
Why did Epaphras travel to see Paul in Rome , and what can we learn from Paul’s response ?
He reported on the faith , love , and evangelizing efforts of those Christians .
Early in his letter , Paul provided insight into a form of help that we might overlook .
7 , 8 .
Or we may approach Jehovah about Christians and others in a region hit by a disaster or tragedy .
And other prayers focused on limited groups . ​ — Job 42 : 7 , 8 ; Luke 6 : 28 ; Acts 7 : 60 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 1 , 2 .
He asked that prayer be offered for him or for him and his associates .
Colossians 4 : 2 , 3 reads : “ Be persevering in prayer , remaining awake in it with thanksgiving , at the same time praying also for us , that God may open a door of utterance to us , to speak the sacred secret about the Christ , for which , in fact , I am in prison bonds . ”
The same was true of Paul’s associate in Rome .
Paul indicated that Epaphras was praying specifically for those in Colossae .
But our personal or family prayers can be quite specific .
In your private prayers , why not ask Jehovah to bless her and to help her continue loyal in her service ?
Why could not each of them mention him by name in their private prayers from time to time ?
Because of distance or other circumstances , you may feel limited in what material or direct help you can provide .
A key to helping is your prayers . ​ — Psalm 18 : 2 ; 20 : 1 , 2 ; 34 : 15 ; 46 : 1 ; 121 : 1 - 3 .
16 , 17 .
Only these are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God , and these very ones have become a strengthening aid to me . ” ​ — Colossians 4 : 10 , 11 .
There were many circumcised Jews in Rome , and some were now Christians .
Likely , they did not hesitate to associate with Christians of Gentile background , and they must gladly have shared with Paul in preaching to Gentiles . ​ — Romans 11 : 13 ; Galatians 1 : 16 ; 2 : 11 - 14 .
Note Paul’s comment : “ These very ones have become a strengthening aid to me . ”
Paul used such elsewhere in this very letter but not at Colossians 4 : 11 . ​ — Matthew 5 : 4 ; Acts 4 : 36 ; 9 : 31 ; 2 Corinthians 1 : 4 ; Colossians 2 : 2 ; 4 : 8 .
19 , 20 . ( a ) What is the sense of the expression that Paul applied to the brothers aiding him in Rome ?
( b ) In what ways might those brothers have helped Paul ?
The Greek term rendered “ strengthening aid ” at Colossians 4 : 11 was sometimes used in secular texts for a medicine to relieve distress .
Today’s English Version uses the phrase : “ They have been a great help to me . ”
Can you not imagine those brothers helping Paul with his needs , doing such basic things as shopping or running errands for him ?
Thus they may feel freer to ask for your help if they need some medicine from the pharmacy , or the like .
They are simply examples , but these can remind us of real situations in which we can become more of “ a strengthening aid ” to our brothers and sisters .
The point is not that we develop the inclinations of humanitarians .
We mention others by name in our private prayers and make efforts to strengthen them because of this : We believe that our brothers and sisters want to “ walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him . ”
Can you include another Christian in your family outings ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) Outsiders noted what about the early Christians ?
JESUS ’ followers were deeply interested in fellow worshipers .
Tertullian ( writer of the second and third centuries C.E . ) told of the kindness that they showed toward orphans , the poor , and the elderly .
You can see that Epaphras ’ prayers for his loved ones had two aspects : ( 1 ) that they “ finally stand complete ” and ( 2 ) that they stand “ with firm conviction in all the will of God . ”
Paul wrote the Ephesians , living to the west of Colossae , that shepherds and teachers try to help “ all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God , to a full - grown man , to the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ . ”
How can we make completeness a key goal ?
Do we consider Bible principles before we make decisions ?
Example one : Suppose we grew up in a climate marked by prejudice or hostility toward people of another race , nationality , or region .
Do we have ‘ a chip on our shoulder , ’ being quick to think something negative if one from that background errs or slights us in some minor way ?
Now , more so than before , are we able to see ​ — even look for — ​ ways in which others are superior ?
‘ I must admit that this sister is superior to me in being patient . ’
‘ She is superior in controlling her temper . ’
Epaphras prayed that the Colossians “ stand complete . ”
And Paul reminded the Corinthians about some in the past who had served Jehovah for a time but then failed .
He warned spirit - anointed brothers : “ Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall . ”
10 , 11 . ( a ) Epaphras set what pattern for us as to prayer ?
( b ) In line with what Epaphras did , what resolve would you like to make ?
Epaphras ’ prayers for the Colossians were of that sort .
And plan to do it more as you consider the yeartext .
What was it ?
He prayed that they would stand “ with firm conviction in all the will of God . ”
They had a distinct hope , life in the heavens , and they had every reason to keep that hope bright .
That valid hope is clearly part of “ the will of God . ”
Is it part of your “ firm conviction in all the will of God ” ?
Give attention to where Paul puts “ hope ” in his reasoning : “ Let us exult while in tribulations , since we know that tribulation produces endurance ; endurance , in turn , an approved condition ; the approved condition , in turn , hope , and the hope does not lead to disappointment ; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 3 - 5 .
17 , 18 . ( a ) How did the series that Paul presented to the Romans lead up to hope ?
Some have been physically assaulted , have had their Bible literature confiscated , or have been the object of lying reports in the media .
Then endurance led to an approved condition .
If a relatively few deflect from the Christian way , why need this be no cause for discouragement ?
No , indeed !
In what sense will your standing complete with firm conviction be noticed ?
Be confident of that .
Why ?
• What is involved in your ‘ standing complete ’ ?
• As suggested at Romans 5 : 4 , 5 , what type of hope do you want to have ?
[ Pictures on page 23 ]
Your sure hope and firm conviction are shared by millions of others
Why is it so essential that Jesus said that it , above all else , characterizes his disciples ?
Let us consider these questions .
Genuine love as it is revealed in the Bible is never merely intellectual .
It entails deep sincerity and full emotional commitment . ​ — 1 Peter 1 : 22 .
Love ​ — An Essential Quality
He said : “ You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you .
The Bible says that taking in knowledge of Jehovah and Jesus means everlasting life .
For example , it is vital continually to take in knowledge of God’s Word .
Hence , there is a great need for more elders , and those who reach out for the privilege are to be commended .
However , those reaching out for privileges of oversight will maintain a good balance if they keep in mind the purpose of such a privilege .
Simply having authority or a wider name recognition is not the important thing .
Elders who please Jehovah are motivated by love for him and for their brothers .
They are not seeking prominence or influence .
Why do Christians keep Jehovah’s promised blessings in mind ?
The importance of being motivated by love is seen in another way .
Most of us long for the fulfillment of God’s promises and echo the sentiment of the apostle John : “ Amen !
Yes , love builds us up .
How can we learn to love Jehovah , even though we cannot see him ?
From Jesus ’ words , it is clear that first and foremost we should love Jehovah .
Today , Jehovah cares for us , guides us , strengthens us , and encourages us .
How Can We Show Our Love ?
Obedience to God’s Word in such things is evidence that our love for Jehovah is genuine .
15 , 16 .
Love for Jehovah helps people to make good decisions .
For some years , he and his wife studied the Bible and despite obstacles eventually qualified as Kingdom publishers .
Last year , Gazmend was baptized , one of 366 baptized in Albania in the 2000 service year .
In fact , worldwide such love moved 805,205 to share in different features of the pioneer ministry during the 2000 service year .
What an expression of love and faith those pioneers made !
We today are like the ones addressed by Peter when he said : “ Though you never saw [ Jesus ] , you love him . ”
On April 19 , 2000 , a total of 14,872,086 were reminded of our reasons for loving Jesus when they attended the annual Memorial of his death .
Jesus said that we should love Jehovah with our whole heart , soul , mind , and strength .
And how does love of neighbor help us to maintain a good balance and a proper motive ?
Do You Remember ?
• Why is love a vital quality ?
Because we show our love of God by obeying his Word , and his Word commands us to love our neighbor .
And he was referring to a love that is different from that which naturally exists within families or between a man and a woman .
A Jewish scribe ​ — who , as Jesus discerned , was speaking intelligently — ​ agreed with Jesus that love of God should be “ with one’s whole heart and with one’s whole understanding and with one’s whole strength . ”
( a ) How did Jesus teach a “ man versed in the Law ” that he should have an extensive view of who is his neighbor ?
Love Within the Family
As a result , many Christian parents have experienced a joy similar to that of a mother in the Netherlands .
The peak of 31,089 publishers reporting in the Netherlands last year includes many who learned from their parents to love Jehovah .
In 1998 , he was baptized and was later overjoyed when his wife agreed to study the Bible .
According to a man in Germany , what strengthened his marriage ?
Their love is expressed in action , as Paul showed when he said : “ Through love slave for one another . ”
A financial crisis left them without work or income , so the publishers decided to raise money by selling food to the local fishermen when these came home after a night’s fishing .
10 , 11 .
An example is in the Solomon Islands .
Eventually , the volunteers had to leave , but not before they had trained local brothers to complete the foundation .
Like God , We Love the World
How do we imitate Jehovah in our attitude toward those not of our faith ?
Like Jehovah God , we act lovingly toward all ​ — including those not of our faith .
This can result in salvation to any who listen . ​ — Mark 13 : 10 ; 1 Timothy 4 : 16 .
To do this , they had to learn a new language , but their loving interest was rewarded when despite a heavy downpour of rain , 27 attended a public talk .
At present , she corresponds with 42 people and conducts 11 Bible studies .
Jesus told the man versed in the Law that a Samaritan could be viewed as a neighbor .
In his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus went even further when he said : “ You heard that it was said , ‘ You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
This was serious because in Europe some speak of Jehovah’s Witnesses in this way in order to persuade people that the activities of the Witnesses should be restricted or banned .
Finally , the editor realized that the original article was wrong , and he published a retraction .
How Can We Cultivate Love ?
What indicates that it might not always be easy to act lovingly toward others ?
No wonder that we are told : “ Pursue love ” !
How can we do this ?
This love is a strong incentive to love our neighbor .
Why ?
Fourth , we can seek the help of holy spirit because love is part of the fruitage of the spirit .
However , some showed interest , so that 433,454,049 return visits were made and 4,766,631 Bible studies were conducted .
What a demonstration all of this was of the love Jehovah’s Witnesses have for their God and for their neighbor !
That love will never grow cold .
2000 SERVICE YEAR REPORT OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORLDWIDE
A New Way to Declare the Good News
Imagine that you are seated among 5,000 others in a darkened auditorium in New York City .
You are at the premiere of something technically innovative , and the message is unique .
Russell realized the potential for motion pictures to reach masses of people .
Designed to be shown in four segments , the “ Photo - Drama ” took viewers from creation down through human history to the climax of Jehovah God’s purpose for the earth and humankind at the end of Christ’s Millennial Reign .
Music lover Karl F .
Klein of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses adds : “ At the same time that these pictures were being shown , there was an accompaniment of very fine music , such gems as Narcissus and Humoreske . ”
“ Sometimes humorous mishaps would take place , ” recalled Clayton J .
Woodworth , Jr .
By the end of 1914 , the “ Photo - Drama ” had been presented to audiences totaling over 9,000,000 in North America , Europe , and Australia .
Because its case of phonograph records weighed only 30 pounds [ 14 kg ] .
For an exhibition , of course , it would also be necessary to carry a phonograph .
Millions of Kingdom proclaimers ​ — a mighty nation — ​ are now associating with more than 91,000 congregations in 235 lands around the earth .
Theocratic ​ — Not Democratic — ​ Appointment
Explain .
( b ) Why are the appointments of overseers and ministerial servants theocratic ?
These sincere Christians endeavor to stick to Jehovah’s standards .
If elements of the world seek to interfere with these appointments , Jehovah’s people refuse to compromise .
As servants of the Great Theocrat , Jehovah , we do well to bear in mind the differences between democratic and theocratic procedures .
He said : “ Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock , among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers , to shepherd the congregation of God , which he purchased with the blood of his own Son . ”
How is it that the holy spirit plays a pivotal role in theocratic appointments ?
For instance , overseers were to be irreprehensible , moderate in habits , sound in mind , orderly , hospitable , qualified to teach , and exemplary as family heads .
What are some of the qualifications that must be met by men reaching out for congregational responsibility ?
A review of these qualifications shows that those who take the lead in Jehovah’s worship must be exemplary in Christian conduct .
Men who reach out for congregational responsibility must give evidence that holy spirit is operating on them .
In their overall pattern of life , however , all who hope to be appointed as overseers or ministerial servants should demonstrate that they are spiritual men , measuring up to the requirements of God’s Word .
So when the elders in the local congregation meet to recommend men for congregational responsibility , they pray for God’s spirit to guide them .
While men on the scene made the recommendations , the appointments were made by responsible men there in Jerusalem .
However , they do commission responsible brothers to act for them in making certain other appointments .
‘ Make Appointments , as I Gave You Orders ’
Why did Paul leave Titus in Crete , and what does this indicate regarding theocratic appointments today ?
Paul then outlined the qualifications that Titus was to look for in men who would qualify for such appointments .
Today , therefore , the Governing Body appoints qualified brothers at the branches to represent it in making appointments of elders and ministerial servants .
( b ) How is the whole process of recommendation and appointment carried out ?
Such a letter may be used to appoint more than one brother in the congregation .
This is the case because the qualifications are set out in God’s Word , which is inspired by holy spirit , and the individual appointed gives evidence of producing the fruitage of that spirit .
Moreover , the Christian spirit and earnest efforts of these men contribute greatly to our wonderful peace and unity as Jehovah’s servants .
How grateful we are for Jehovah’s direction by means of his Word and holy spirit !
We are deeply grateful for the theocratic arrangements in place among us .
• How are responsible Christian men appointed by holy spirit ?
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
What can be said about the religious situation that exists today ?
They were , in fact , “ the least ” of them .
They were anointed with Jehovah’s holy spirit and zealously went forth declaring the truth about God and Christ to others . ​ — Acts 2 : 41 , 42 .
The early Christians kept in step with the spiritual enlightenment provided through divinely inspired letters .
At the Cedar Point , Ohio , convention in 1919 , God’s Kingdom was highlighted .
It was also discerned in the 1920 ’ s that there are two opposing organizations ​ — Jehovah’s and Satan’s .
What spiritual enlightenment concerning the great crowd was provided in 1935 ?
At the Washington , D.C . , convention in 1935 , it was thrilling to learn that the great multitude , or great crowd , of Revelation chapter 7 is a class with an earthly hope .
What big issue was highlighted at the St .
It is universal domination , or sovereignty .
This is the issue that must be settled soon , and the great and fear - inspiring day for that to be done comes on apace !
At that convention and at subsequent ones , there have been numerous flashes of spiritual light .
15 , 16 . ( a ) How did we move ahead in our ministry during the 1920 ’ s and 1930 ’ s ?
Currently , we use the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life .
Moving Ahead With Organizational Refinements
In keeping with Isaiah 60 : 17 , how has Jehovah’s organization moved ahead ?
Another milestone was reached in 1938 when all servants in the congregation began to be appointed more closely in line with the arrangements for theocratic appointment in the early Christian congregation .
Since then , attention has been given to simplifying the work at headquarters and at the branches of the Watch Tower Society so as to “ make sure of the more important things . ”
Keeping in step with Jehovah’s progressive organization requires that we recognize the God - assigned role of Jesus Christ as “ head of the congregation . ”
He also knows his sheep and their deeds .
Before giving the Model Prayer , Jesus stated : “ God your Father knows what things you are needing before ever you ask him . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 8 - 13 .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Picture on page 17 ]
Like David , we cannot recount all of Jehovah’s wonderful works
[ Picture on page 18 ]
God’s flock has benefited from timely adjustments in organizational procedures
In fact , this has almost always been the case .
In 1940 , Hayden C .
Swingle replaced Hayden C .
Covington on the board of directors , and Frederick W .
A Historic Annual Meeting
At the annual meeting held on October 2 , 1944 , in Pittsburgh , the members of the Pennsylvania corporation adopted six resolutions amending its charter .
The charter had provided that voting shares be issued to contributors of funds to the Society’s work , but the third amendment eliminated that provision .
In referring to “ overseers ” and “ task assigners , ” this prophecy pointed to improvements in organizational procedures among Jehovah’s people .
In 1971 the same speaker explained that the members of the Watch Tower Society could not vote in the members of the anointed Governing Body .
Why ?
“ Because , ” he said , “ the governing body of the ‘ slave ’ class is not appointed by any man .
It is appointed by . . . Jesus Christ , the Head of the true Christian congregation and the Lord and Master of the ‘ faithful and discreet slave ’ class . ”
This would no longer be the case .
While not equal in experience or ability , Governing Body members would be equal in responsibility .
Society . . .
At that unforgettable annual meeting in 1971 , a distinction was clearly drawn between the spirit - anointed members of the Governing Body and the directors of the Pennsylvania corporation .
All of them harmoniously assist and have a role to play in getting the good news preached earth wide .
No matter where they are located or who serve as directors or officers , these entities are theocratically guided and used by the Governing Body .
We are thankful for the services of such legal entities .
The Society published the Bible Students ’ edition of the King James Version , which included a 500 - page appendix .
Then in 1944 the Society began to print the American Standard Version of 1901 , which uses the divine name .
The legal entities used by Jehovah’s Witnesses have assisted in printing and distributing all of these Bible translations .
Yet , this does not prevent the ‘ slave ’ from allowing qualified overseers from among the “ other sheep ” to care for legal and administrative responsibilities .
These are convenient , but they are not indispensable .
As we look to the future , we are confident that Jehovah will care for the spiritual and material needs of his people .
This was made clear at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania , held at the Jersey City , New Jersey , Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses on Saturday , October 7 , 2000 .
In his opening remarks , the chairman , John E .
The potential for growth in Haiti is shown by the fact that on April 19 , 2000 , four times the number of Kingdom publishers in that land attended the Memorial of Christ’s death .
Growth in the sign - language congregations is particularly notable .
This is an average of one study per publisher .
Sadly , young brothers are still being incarcerated because of their neutrality .
A peak of 533,665 Kingdom proclaimers reported field service in Mexico in August 2000 .
Vast Building Program in South Africa
During the 2000 service year , this land saw a peak of 112,720 publishers .
“ Truly , Jehovah has raised up a new , youthful generation of Witnesses to declare his name ! ”
Each month , on the average , we receive a thousand letters from interested people asking for more information . ”
Daniel Sydlik , a member of the Governing Body , gave an absorbing talk .
The article “ How the Governing Body Differs From a Legal Corporation , ” appearing in this magazine , is based on that informative presentation .
The annual meeting also included a stirring talk given by Governing Body member David Splane on the yeartext for the year 2001 .
[ Footnote ]
AT THE conclusion of the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania on October 7 , 2000 , a special announcement was made by the chairman , John E .
In their discourses , Brothers Sydlik and Jaracz had explained that the fact that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” has been entrusted with all of the Lord’s earthly belongings does not prevent the slave class from allowing qualified men from among the “ other sheep ” to care for certain routine administrative responsibilities .
Kingdom Proclaimers Report
Latvia Responds to the Good News
THE Bible clearly shows that it is God’s will that “ all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Because of her physical condition , she was baptized in her own home .
How did Anna’s daughter react to this ?
Anna’s reply ?
Have You Made the Truth Your Own ?
“ Be transformed by making your mind over , that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . ” ​ — ROMANS 12 : 2 .
TO BE a true Christian in these last days ​ — these “ critical times hard to deal with ” — ​ is not easy .
Would he hold back something so good from you ?
What doubts might affect some today ?
For example : “ How do we know that this is the truth as Jesus taught it ? ”
“ Are we on the threshold of Armageddon , or is it a long way off ? ”
5 , 6 .
We can also ask for help from those who are strong in the faith , never doubting that Jehovah will give us the support we need .
What if Doubts Linger ?
9 , 10 .
What can we do to overcome lingering doubts ?
How was Elisha’s attendant affected by doubt ?
Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant’s eyes , so that he saw ; and , look !
These leave no room for doubt that Jehovah does have a heavenly organization supporting his servants in the worldwide educational work today . ​ — Isaiah 6 : 1 - 4 ; Ezekiel 1 : 4 - 28 ; Daniel 7 : 9 , 10 ; Revelation 4 : 1 - 11 ; 14 : 6 , 7 .
Why have some Christians fallen victim to Satan’s machinations ?
They have allowed themselves to fall into Satan’s alluring trap .
Such ones have failed to remain “ babes as to badness . ”
They have neglected to put on and maintain their “ complete suit of armor from God . ” ​ — Ephesians 6 : 10 - 13 ; Colossians 3 : 5 - 10 ; 1 Timothy 1 : 18 , 19 .
Why might some find it difficult to appreciate their spiritual heritage ?
Certainly , we do not need to experience the world’s “ low sink of debauchery ” to see how debased life can be .
Our Name Not Merely a Label
Of course , this would recommend that we always have some form of literature with us no matter where we may be ​ — at home , at work , in school , at the store , or at places of recreation . ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 15 .
For the same reason , people may be less inclined to recount lewd jokes in our presence .
How do we know that we are deep in the last days ?
The article stated : “ 1999 turned out to be the most murderous year in the second half of the most murderous century . ”
Jehovah’s blessing is clearly evident on the greatest Bible educational work that has ever been done in all the world as a witness to the nations .
Slacking the hand will not merit Jehovah’s blessing .
Rather , it is the time to “ become steadfast , unmovable , always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 58 .
See The Watchtower , January 15 , 2000 , pages 12 - 14 .
Paragraphs 13 - 18 give a review of six lines of powerful evidence showing that since 1914 we have been living in the last days .
Do You Recall ?
Regular Bible study and prayer can help us dispel doubts
Elisha’s attendant had his doubts resolved by a vision
We can see in this context that dedication is a serious matter .
It implies voluntary identification as a servant of God , and it requires clean conduct .
After we gained accurate knowledge of Jehovah God and his purposes and of Jesus Christ and his role in those purposes , we made the personal decision to serve God with our whole heart , mind , soul , and strength .
What example did the apostle John set for us ?
What about the faithful apostle John , who was exiled to the inhospitable island of Patmos in his old age for “ speaking about God and bearing witness to Jesus ” ?
No , John remained faithful to his death , knowing that although ‘ the appointed time was near , ’ the fulfillment of his visions was for a later date . ​ — Revelation 1 : 3 ; Daniel 12 : 4 .
He became a Witness in 1939 at the beginning of World War II , and he gave up a flourishing press photography business in order to take up the full - time ministry .
He loyally lived up to his dedication , and right down to his death in 1986 , he proclaimed the imminence of God’s war of Armageddon .
Many of them spent ten years or more in military prisons .
( b ) How does Jehovah view our service to him ?
One person’s situation may allow him to serve in the full - time ministry as a pioneer , as a volunteer in a branch office of the Watch Tower Society , as a missionary , or in the traveling ministry .
Are their relatively few hours spent in the ministry each month worth any less in Jehovah’s eyes than the many hours spent by a full - time servant ?
In any case , our salvation depends , not on anything we might do , but on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness through Christ Jesus , our Lord .
To live up to our dedication in a conscientious manner , we should use each day to Jehovah’s praise .
At the end of each day , can we look back on it and see how we contributed in some way to the sanctification of God’s name and the proclamation of the Kingdom good news ?
Keep Your Vision Clear
We are living in times that are becoming more difficult for Christians .
Satan and his agents try to blur the distinction between good and bad , clean and unclean , moral and immoral , ethical and unethical .
Our spiritual vision can become blurred , or out of focus , so that we fail to discern his crafty acts .
What should be our determination ?
If we appreciate the seriousness of our dedication to Jehovah God , what should we be determined to do ?
Thus , never let it be said that we have left the love that we had when we first knew the truth .

Jehovah’s Day of Judgment Is Near !
JEHOVAH GOD is about to swing into action against the wicked .
I will cut off mankind from the surface of the ground . ”
Therefore , God’s prophet urged : “ Before the statute gives birth to anything , before the day has passed by just like chaff , before there comes upon you people the burning anger of Jehovah , before there comes upon you the day of Jehovah’s anger , seek Jehovah , all you meek ones of the earth , who have practiced His own judicial decision .
4 , 5 .
How was Zephaniah 1 : 1 - 3 fulfilled upon wicked ones in Judah ?
Yes , Jehovah was going to bring gross wickedness to an end in the land of Judah .
Whom would God use to “ finish everything off the surface of the ground ” ?
At that time , there was a ‘ finishing off ’ of wicked ones in Judah .
Foretelling God’s acts against false worshipers , Zephaniah 1 : 4 - 6 says : “ I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and I will cut off from this place the remaining ones of the Baal , the name of the foreign - god priests along with the priests , and those who are bowing down upon the roofs to the army of the heavens , and those who are bowing down , making sworn oaths to Jehovah and making sworn oaths by Malcam ; and those who are drawing back from following Jehovah and who have not sought Jehovah and have not inquired of him . ”
For instance , there was the Baal worshiped by Moabites and Midianites at Mount Peor .
Divine wrath would also be unleashed upon those trying to mix true worship with false religion by ‘ making sworn oaths to Jehovah and by Malcam . ’
The worship of Molech included child sacrifice . ​ — 1 Kings 11 : 5 ; Jeremiah 32 : 35 .
What is the essence of Zephaniah 1 : 8 - 11 ?
How far - reaching would Jehovah’s examination of his professed worshipers be ?
“ The Great Day of Jehovah Is Near ”
According to Zephaniah 1 : 14 - 16 , how close is Jehovah’s day of judgment ?
It is near , and there is a hurrying of it very much .
The sound of the day of Jehovah is bitter .
Judah’s sinful priests , princes , and people were warned that ‘ the great day of Jehovah was near . ’
Babylonian invaders caused Judah’s inhabitants many sufferings , including mental anguish in the face of death and destruction .
That “ day of storm and of desolation ” was one of darkness , clouds , and thick gloom , perhaps not only figuratively but also literally , for smoke and carnage were everywhere .
It was “ a day of horn and of alarm signal , ” but warnings were sounded in vain .
Fortifications of the present wicked system of things will be just as useless against the weaponry in God’s heavenly arsenal , ready for his early use in selective destruction .
Do you hope to be spared ?
Have you taken a firm stand on the side of Jehovah , ‘ who guards all those loving him but who will annihilate all the wicked ones ’ ? ​ — Psalm 145 : 20 .
21 , 22 .
How will Zephaniah 1 : 17 , 18 be fulfilled in our day ?
As he did in the days of Zephaniah , Jehovah will soon bring distress upon “ all the inhabitants of the earth , ” those who refuse to heed his warning .
Nobody can save those who fight against God and his people .
• What is in store for Christendom and all the wicked of our day ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
Jehovah’s day came upon Judah and Jerusalem at Babylonian hands in 607 B.C.E .
[ Picture on page 16 ]
What was the spiritual condition of Judah when Zephaniah began his prophetic work ?
The civil leaders ​ — the princes , the nobles , and the judges — ​ were oppressing the very ones they were supposed to protect .
No wonder Jehovah decided to ‘ stretch out his hand ’ against Judah and Jerusalem in order to destroy them ! ​ — Zephaniah 1 : 4 .
Zephaniah wrote : “ Before the statute gives birth to anything , before the day has passed by just like chaff , before there comes upon you people the burning anger of Jehovah , before there comes upon you the day of Jehovah’s anger , seek Jehovah , all you meek ones of the earth , who have practiced His own judicial decision .
These requirements should be of great interest to us today .
Why ?
It means getting to know how God views matters and being attentive to his feelings .
How do we “ seek righteousness , ” and why is this possible even in this world ?
Judah lost God’s favor because of mimicking her ungodly neighboring nations .
What happened in Judah in 607 B.C.E . , but who were spared ?
Yet , all was not lost .
As regards Ashdod , at high noon they will drive her out ; and as regards Ekron , she will be uprooted . ”
Today , where is Philistia and where are its cities ?
Search though you may , you cannot find them .
The extent of the devastation was vividly foretold in these words : “ Both pelican and porcupine will spend the night right among her [ fallen ] pillar capitals .
Gone from the city streets would be the sounds of commerce , the cries of warriors , the chants of priests .
Zephaniah’s prophecy again focuses on Judah and Jerusalem .
She did not listen to a voice ; she did not accept discipline . In Jehovah she did not trust .
Deplorable , indeed , was the ruthlessness of the princes , nobles , and judges .
Morning by morning he kept giving his own judicial decision . At daylight it did not prove lacking . ”
“ But the unrighteous one was knowing no shame , ” said Zephaniah .
Whether the people listen or not , your ministry is a success from God’s standpoint as long as you are carrying it out faithfully ; you have no need for shame as you do God’s work with zeal .
Jehovah expands his denunciation to include all the nations : “ I cut off nations ; their corner towers were desolated .
Their cities were laid waste . ”
In Zephaniah’s day , God’s anger was unleashed upon those wickedly “ making all their dealings ruinous . ”
• How can we “ seek meekness ” ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Because they continue to seek Jehovah , a great crowd will survive the day of his anger
Jehovah’s Restored People Praise Him Earth Wide
“ A Pure Language ” for Whom ?
4 , 5 . ( a ) What would happen to the unrighteous ?
In 539 B.C.E . , Babylon was overthrown by the Medes and the Persians under King Cyrus .
In time , Jerusalem’s temple was rebuilt , and the priesthood was again in a position to instruct the people in the Law .
Break out in cheers , O Israel !
Rejoice and exult with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem !
He has turned away your enemy . The king of Israel , Jehovah , is in the midst of you .
He will exult over you with rejoicing .
Those prophetic words referred to the remnant gathered out of Babylonian captivity and brought back to their ancestral land .
Here I am acting against all those afflicting you , at that time ; and I will save her that is limping , and her that is dispersed I shall collect together .
How that restoration brought praise to Jehovah and to those bearing his name !
10 , 11 .
Micah’s prophecy answers : “ But we , for our part , shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite , even forever . ”
It is clear that these Witnesses of Jehovah are the ones fulfilling Jesus ’ prophetic words : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations ; and then the end will come . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 .
The spiritual prosperity that Jehovah’s servants enjoy in these last days is the direct result of having him ‘ in their midst ’ as their all - powerful God .
Now it represents the meek ones of all the nations throughout the entire earth , those who respond favorably to the global Kingdom - preaching work and who stream to “ the mountain of the house of Jehovah . ”
After 537 B.C.E . , many in the surrounding nations were astonished by the restoration of God’s servants to true worship in their homeland .
What did one writer say about Jehovah’s Witnesses , and what growth have they experienced ?
Only “ to those obeying him as ruler . ”
They use the pure language to praise Jehovah earth wide on a huge and growing scale .
Anointed Christians have taken the lead in seeking Jehovah and speaking the pure language .
Although anointed ones have diminished in number to fewer than 8,700 , some six million others are imitating their faith by seeking Jehovah and speaking the pure language .
These are the growing number of the great crowd from all nations who exercise faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice , render sacred service in the earthly courtyard of God’s spiritual temple , and will survive “ the great tribulation ” soon to come upon this unrighteous world . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 14 , 15 .
The great crowd will be ushered into God’s righteous new world .
In principle , to them apply the words : “ All your sons [ and daughters , of course ] will be persons taught by Jehovah , and the peace of your sons will be abundant .
Greatest Teaching Work in History
In an orderly manner , he will bring them back to life .
And what a privilege we have right now to be God’s people , those experiencing the grand fulfillment of the prophetic words recorded at Zephaniah 3 : 20 !
• Zephaniah’s restoration prophecy has had what fulfillments ?
• What great teaching work will take place in the new world ?

Rejoicing for Those Who Walk in the Light
Without sunlight , we could not exist .
What path did Israel and Judah choose , and how did Jehovah respond ?
Like those mentioned in the book of Proverbs , they were “ leaving the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness . ”
Yet , while Jehovah was angry with his people , he did not completely abandon them .
It was life - giving .
Such leaders claim to serve God , but in truth most of them promote the gods of this world ​ — nationalism , militarism , wealth , and prominent individuals — ​ to say nothing of teaching pagan doctrines .
Isaiah was evidently familiar with these writings .
What is this city ?
Does the city mentioned by Isaiah have a counterpart today ?
Yes .
The organized preaching work virtually ceased .
“ A Stronghold to the Lowly One ”
He provides for them as their loving Father .
Then , the “ banquet of well - oiled dishes ” will include physical food in abundance .
For them , the words of the psalmist are comforting indeed .
( b ) How will ‘ the reproach of Jehovah’s people ’ be removed ?
Listen now to an even more wonderful promise .
Sin and death , which have weighed on mankind like a suffocating blanket , will be no more .
How we long for the day when the benefits of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice are fully applied to obedient and faithful humankind ! ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
Because Jehovah will remove their source ​ — the father of the lie , Satan the Devil , along with all of Satan’s seed . ​ — John 8 : 44 .
No , indeed !
“ Jehovah is my light and my salvation .
Those who choose the light can say with the psalmist : “ Jehovah is my light and my salvation . Of whom shall I be in fear ? ”
Regarding 607 B.C.E . , Jehovah promised that those who listened to him would survive .
[ God ] sets salvation itself for walls and rampart .
With his blessing , the Israel of God has “ a strong city , ” a citylike organization that supports and protects it .
What mental attitude do we do well to cultivate ?
Jehovah supports those mentally inclined to trust in him and comply with his righteous principles .
Those with that mind - set look to “ Jah Jehovah ” as the only secure Rock .
Humiliation for God’s Enemies
( b ) In what way was “ Babylon the Great ” humiliated ?
That city certainly afflicted God’s people .
What an abasement !
By heeding his guidance , these meek ones show that they hope in Jehovah and wholeheartedly cherish his name ​ — his “ memorial . ” ​ — Exodus 3 : 15 .
Picture the prophet using the quiet times of the night to pray to Jehovah , expressing his deepest thoughts and ardently seeking Jehovah’s guidance .
9 , 10 .
Frequently , the majority chose rebellion and apostasy rather than the light of Jehovah’s truth .
In Isaiah’s day when Jehovah’s hand protected Judah against her enemies , the majority refused to recognize this .
Aspects of this prophecy had a fulfillment when God allowed his anointed servants to go into spiritual captivity in 1918 and then liberated them in 1919 .
What rich blessings have Jehovah’s anointed servants enjoyed since 1919 ?
Judah needed Jehovah’s help to escape from captivity in Babylon .
Awake and cry out joyfully , you residents in the dust !
For your dew is as the dew of mallows , and the earth itself will let even those impotent in death drop in birth . ”
Yes , those impotent in death would , as it were , be reborn for renewed activity !
16 , 17 . ( a ) In 539 B.C.E . , what did the Jews need to do in order to survive the fall of Babylon ?
( b ) Likely , what are the “ interior rooms ” today , and how do they benefit us ?
Jehovah’s servants always need his protection .
Soon , though , he will stretch out his hand for the last time against Satan’s world , and his worshipers will need his help as never before .
Those who heeded it would have stayed in their houses , safe from the conquering soldiers out in the streets .
Regarding that time , Isaiah prophesies : “ In that day Jehovah , with his hard and great and strong sword , will turn his attention to Leviathan , the gliding serpent , even to Leviathan , the crooked serpent , and he will certainly kill the sea monster that is in the sea . ”
How comforting to be assured of that !
Isaiah beautifully describes the joy of Jehovah’s people when he writes : “ In that day sing to her , you people : ‘ A vineyard of foaming wine ! I , Jehovah , am safeguarding her . Every moment I shall water her . In order that no one may turn his attention against her , I shall safeguard her even night and day . ’ ”
How does Jehovah protect the Christian congregation ?
Hence , let no one endanger the welfare of the Christian congregation !
In so doing , we make peace with God ​ — something of such importance that Isaiah mentions it twice . ​ — Psalm 85 : 1 , 2 , 8 ; Romans 5 : 1 .
Anointed Christians have filled the earth with “ produce , ” nourishing spiritual food .
Yes , hope in Jehovah . ” ​ — Psalm 27 : 1b , 14 .
• What increase is prophesied in Isaiah ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
[ Picture on page 19 ]
In addition to conveying it by word of mouth , they placed in the hands of the public more than 700 million pieces of printed material to advertise and explain it .
From a secular point of view , they may appear to be ill - qualified for the task .
Yes , all these blessings and more can be yours if you respond and react favorably to the proclamation of the Kingdom good news .
Let your kingdom come .
As a nation , they had received the Law covenant through Moses about 1,500 years earlier .
Greek culture and philosophy had infiltrated Jewish religious teachings .
The law received from God through Moses was now adulterated , even invalidated , by man - made beliefs and traditions .
Jesus , like a sacrificial lamb , was to ‘ take sin away ’ and bring about a reversal of the sad state of human affairs .
“ The wages sin pays is death , ” the Bible explains , “ but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” ​ — Romans 6 : 23 .
As a perfect man ​ — in fact , the greatest man who ever lived — ​ Jesus took up preaching the good news .
As mentioned earlier , the good news of God’s Kingdom is being proclaimed and taught in all the inhabited earth today .
The following article will explain .
Kingdom Blessings Can Be Yours
In other words , being sincere and of honest heart , Paul repented . ​ — Galatians 1 : 13 - 16 .
A Change That Brought Blessings
Their beliefs included much human philosophy and tradition .
The apostle Paul admonished : “ Prove to [ yourself ] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . ”
Remember that Saul had his ideas about God’s will before he became the apostle Paul .
In other words , what may have the appearance of godliness is not necessarily approved by God .
ONE of the most astounding prophecies in the Bible is found at Acts 1 : 8 .
Bearing witness to Jesus also required sharing his powerful teachings with others and explaining his role in Jehovah’s purpose .
It is a fact of history that cannot be denied .
The commission to preach and teach also manifested God’s love for those bearing the message , since it allowed them to express their devotion to Jehovah and display their love for fellow humans .
( a ) Where do we find the most reliable history of the early Christians , and what growth is described therein ?
The account of the early Christians , who were empowered by holy spirit , is both exciting and highly meaningful to us today .
We also face problems similar to those faced by Christians in the first century .
Earlier , on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , God’s holy spirit was poured out upon about 120 disciples gathered in an upper room .
What commotion there must have been as thousands of people made their way to the pool or pools in and around Jerusalem to be baptized in the name of Jesus , the man who had been impaled as a criminal some 50 days earlier ! ​ — Acts 2 : 41 .
They were willing to die for what they believed in . ​ — Acts 7 : 51 - 60 .
What responsibility did the early Christians accept , and what parallel do we find today ?
One Bible scholar said : “ Communicating the faith was not regarded as the preserve of the very zealous or of the officially designated evangelist .
Geographical Growth
What type of growth is described at Acts 12 : 24 , and how did this take place ?
Despite governmental opposition , the work continued to prosper .
The holy spirit was first poured out in Jerusalem , and from there the word spread quickly .
For example , Acts 17 : 6 relates that in Thessalonica , northern Greece , opposers cried out : “ These men that have overturned the inhabited earth are present here also . ”
He complained : “ [ It ] is not confined to the cities only , but has spread its infection among the neighboring villages and country . ”
In this 21st century , the word of God has spread to literally all parts of the earth .
( a ) What did one Bible historian write about the early Christians ?
( b ) To whom did the disciples give credit for their success ?
Still , those early Christians recognized that the success of their ministry did not depend on their efforts alone .
They had a divine commission to carry on their work , and they had divine support to accomplish it .
Spiritual growth comes from God .
He wrote : “ I planted , Apollos watered , but God kept making it grow .
For we are God’s fellow workers . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 3 : 6 , 9 .
How did this happen ?
Not long after the spirit was poured out upon the disciples at Pentecost , Peter and John were summoned to speak to the Jewish Sanhedrin , the highest court in the land , whose judges bore responsibility for the execution of Jesus Christ .
Holy spirit also caused Stephen to witness boldly to the Sanhedrin .
Luke reports : “ When they had made supplication , the place in which they were gathered together was shaken ; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness . ” ​ — Acts 4 : 31 .
In addition , holy spirit manifested itself in Christians themselves , producing godly qualities , such as love .
The Bible account says : “ There was not one in need among them ; for all those who were possessors of fields or houses would sell them and bring the values of the things sold and they would deposit them at the feet of the apostles . In turn distribution would be made to each one , just as he would have the need . ”
• What role did holy spirit play in the growth of God’s word ?
[ Picture on page 13 ]
[ Picture Credit Line on page 10 ]
True Christianity Prevails !
By the year 100 probably every province that bordered the Mediterranean had a Christian community within it . ”
Similarly , the apostle Paul had specifically warned that apostasy would precede the day of Jehovah . ​ — 2 Thessalonians 2 : 1 - 3 .
However , Satan’s scheme to thwart Jehovah’s purpose was doomed to failure .
Thus , the Bible itself remained intact , though its message was perverted by many who professed to have the authority to teach it .
This has occurred in “ the time of the end ” ​ — the time in which we are now living .
Jehovah blessed that handful of spirit - anointed Christians .
In the United States , two scholars jointly wrote : “ During the past 75 years the Jehovah’s Witnesses have sustained an extraordinary rate of growth . . . and have done so on a global scale . ”
What has contributed to this growth ?
By means of the preaching activity of his Witnesses , Jehovah is drawing out for his service “ the desirable things of all the nations ” ​ — the meek , sheeplike people of the earth . ​ — Haggai 2 : 6 , 7 .
What sorts of people have responded to the word of God ?
They are to be found among rich and poor , the highly educated and the illiterate .
Under every type of government , in all cultures , from concentration camps to palaces , men and women have responded favorably to the good news .
This adds to the evidence that holy spirit is at work in the lives of those serving God .
How do Jehovah’s Witnesses feel about the evangelizing work , and what reaction to their preaching activity do they expect ?
They take an active part in the evangelizing work .
They are God’s fellow workers who , in harmony with his holy spirit , gather others to Jehovah’s service .
Jesus prepared his followers for mixed reactions to the good news .
Some of these ways reflect remarkable ingenuity .
However , when civil strife erupted in 1995 , civilian traffic along the river was prohibited .
In Nairobi , Kenya , two Christian women in field service had finished working the houses assigned to them .
She implored the Witnesses to come to her home immediately for a discussion , and a Bible study was started with her that very day .
About two weeks earlier , she had lost her baby in death .
Soon the woman was making fine spiritual progress and was better able to cope with the painful loss of her child .
What love has Jehovah shown to humankind by means of the ransom ?
Like the ransom , the preaching work is an expression of Jehovah’s love for people everywhere .
Think about the love Jehovah showed in providing the ransom .
What an awe - inspiring expression of love for humankind !
John 3 : 17 states : “ God sent forth his Son into the world , not for him to judge the world , but for the world to be saved through him . ”
How , in turn , will they hear without someone to preach ? ” ​ — Romans 10 : 13 , 14 .
It is not an easy work , yet how Jehovah rejoices when he observes his people faithfully living the truth and sharing the good news with others !
So whatever your circumstances are , let God’s spirit and the love in your heart motivate you to share in this work .
• How has the word of God prevailed in our day ?

Obedience ​ — An Important Childhood Lesson ?
“ PARENTS Want Individuals , Not Kids Who Obey . ”
The survey also found that parents today believe that it is far more important to teach children such matters as good manners , independence , and responsibility .
Or is it among the important lessons that children can learn and benefit from ?
More important , how does Jehovah God , the Originator of the family arrangement , view obedience to parents , and what are some of the benefits that flow from such obedience ? ​ — Acts 17 : 28 ; Ephesians 3 : 14 , 15 .
Young people , on the other hand , lack the balanced thinking that comes with maturity .
Realistically , the Bible says : “ Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy . ”
In contrast , the lesson of obedience learned in childhood can extend rewardingly throughout one’s life .
The word “ obey ” in its various forms occurs more than 160 times in the Bible .
A confirmation of this promise is found at Proverbs 3 : 1 , 2 : “ My son , my law do not forget , and my commandments may your heart observe , because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you . ”
The grand reward for those who obey is a personal relationship with Jehovah now and everlasting life in a peaceful new world . ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
“ Every good gift and every perfect present ” comes down from God , our heavenly Father . ​ — James 1 : 17 .
Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area can tell you the exact meeting place and time .
Reaching a sealed door , they drilled a hole .
Carter inserted a candle and peered inside .
Among the thousands of treasures in the tomb was a solid gold coffin .
Elihu patiently waited till that dialogue was over .
The One Who Did the Works
Elihu wisely urged Job ​ — and us — ​ to be attentive to the wonderful works of Jehovah God .
Moreover , in view of concerns you may have about health , finances , the future , your family , workmates , and neighbors , why be attentive to God’s works ?
Jehovah brought plagues on ancient Egypt and then parted the Red Sea so that Moses could lead the ancient Israelites to freedom .
There is a similar event related in Joshua chapter 3 .
What did Elihu have in mind about God’s doing things in “ a wonderful way ” ?
We may not be farmers , but rain and snow may affect us .
Have you ever done so ?
So let us see what God asked , and let us think about the implications , yes , let us do what Job 37 : 14 urges us to do .
“ Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth ?
Who set its measurements , in case you know , or who stretched out upon it the measuring line ?
Where was Job ​ — where were any of us — ​ when the earth came to be ?
As if our earth were a building , God asked : “ Who laid its cornerstone ? ”
We know that earth is at exactly the right distance from our sun for us to live and thrive .
And it is the right size too .
Most of us understand that the force of gravity from the huge mass of the sun keeps our earth in place , its socket pedestals sunk down so to speak .
Still , who fully understands gravity ?
In recent years , however , physicists have begun to speculate that gravity might travel in waves made of particles called gravitons . . .
15 - 17 . ( a ) On what did Job 38 : 8 - 11 focus , leading to what questions ?
You might imagine that most of what is to be known about them must be settled by now .
In a widely accepted reference work , you could locate this admission : “ The distribution of the continental platforms and ocean basins on the surface of the globe and the distribution of the major landform features have long been among the most intriguing problems for scientific investigation and theorizing . ”
As you may know , a hypothesis “ implies insufficient evidence to provide more than a tentative explanation . ”
Give Jehovah Due Credit
Humans cannot take credit for the earth’s rotation , alluded to at Job 38 : 12 - 14 .
Now , imagine that God asked you these further questions : “ Have you come to the sources of the sea , or in search of the watery deep have you walked about ? ”
“ Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth ?
( a ) The questions at Job 38 : 19 might bring up what scientific views ?
( b ) The realities about light should move us to do what ?
As for darkness , where , now , is its place ? ”
It answers : “ Seemingly , [ light ] cannot be both because the two models [ waves and particles ] are so different .
We enjoy food and oxygen produced as plants respond to light .
Hardly .
He certainly did not mean , though , that he would keep silent about these grand works .
1 , 2 .
So we have reason to join the psalmist in saying : “ How many your works are , O Jehovah ! All of them in wisdom you have made .
Works Powerful and Wonderful
As recorded at Job 38 : 22 , 23 , 25 - 29 , God asked about what things ?
Some who live in a fast - paced society and who must travel may view snow merely as an obstacle .
In simpler terms , scientists have offered detailed theories , but they really cannot fully explain rain .
How do God’s wonderful works manifest his great power ?
What Effect on You ?
Imagine yourself in Job’s place , being questioned by Almighty God .
Jehovah asks us the questions we read at Job 38 : 33 - 38 .
11 , 12 .
We have touched on only a few of the points that Elihu raised with Job , and we have noted some questions that Jehovah called on Job to answer “ like an able - bodied man . ”
We say “ some ” because in chapters 38 and 39 , God focused attention on other notable aspects of creation .
Who knows all their laws , or statutes ?
Jehovah directed Job’s attention to some of the animals ​ — the lion and the raven , the mountain goat and the zebra , the wild bull and the ostrich , the mighty horse and the eagle .
In effect , God asked Job if he had given these varied animals their characteristics , allowing them to live and to thrive .
You could also examine Job chapters 40 and 41 , where Jehovah again asked Job to respond to questions about two particular creatures .
We understand these to be the hippopotamus ( Behemoth ) , prodigious in size and strong in body , and the formidable Nile crocodile ( Leviathan ) .
But accepting the correction implicit in God’s questions , Job changed his thinking .
After reviewing these creative marvels , we should likewise be impressed with God’s wisdom and power .
One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth , and one night after another night shows forth knowledge . ”
But David went further .
Why was David’s reverential fear of God fitting ?
Snow , hail , rainstorms , wind , and lightning are all in his arsenal .
What force !
He did something like that back in the days of Abraham , who learned that the Judge of all the earth had weighed the wickedness of two cities , Sodom and Gomorrah .
Wonderful Works in the Future
God fulfilled the above prophecy in the past , and he will act wonderfully in the future .
In this context , where Isaiah mentions “ wonderful things ” of God , we find a reliable prophecy that is yet to be fulfilled , just as the judgment on Babylon was fulfilled .
What ‘ wonderful thing ’ is promised ?
And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth , for Jehovah himself has spoken it . ”
The apostle Paul later quoted from that passage and applied it to God’s bringing dead ones back to life , resurrecting the dead .
What a wonderful work that will be ! ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 51 - 54 .
Peace will be abundant .
God will deliver the poor and afflicted .
He promises : “ There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth ; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow . His fruit will be as in [ ancient ] Lebanon , and those who are from the city will blossom like the vegetation of the earth . ” ​ — Psalm 72 : 16 .
That should regularly be a subject of our enthusiastic conversation with relatives and others .
• How should we respond after considering some of God’s wonderful works ?

A Worldwide Association Caring for One Another
Recently , thousands of people , including many of Jehovah’s Witnesses , were obliged to flee the war - torn Democratic Republic of Congo to the relative safety of the Central African Republic .
A list of those who had arrived safely was kept at each Kingdom Hall .
The branch office that directs the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country dispatched three vehicles per day to assist Witnesses who were still en route and to search for any who might be lost .
They immediately ran to the vehicle and identified themselves as Witnesses .
The refugee problem will be a thing of the past .
In the meantime , in harmony with the apostle Paul’s admonition at 1 Corinthians 12 : 14 - 26 , Jehovah’s Witnesses endeavor to take care of one another .
Although separated by rivers , borders , languages , and distance , they are concerned about one another , so they are quick to act when someone falls into need . ​ — James 1 : 22 - 27 .

Three Kingdom Halls were turned into reception centers
SANDRA is a widow who lives in Australia .
“ The realization that I had suddenly lost my mate and best friend overwhelmed me .
Sandra has an older friend , Elaine , who has been a widow for some six years .
Yes , the death of a beloved mate can cause a variety of reactions , for widowhood really involves more than simply living without a husband .
It was hard to know just what to do . ”
Sickness , accidents , wars , ethnic cleansing , and violence in general are contributing to an increasing number of widows .
* Many of these women suffer in silence , not knowing what to do .
Other women are in a situation similar to that of widows because their husbands left them .
Although separation and divorce create problems of their own , a number of the principles discussed in the following article may also help women in these circumstances .
Helping Widows Through Their Trials
Both women were widows .
Naomi , however , lost not only her husband but also her two sons , one of whom had been Ruth’s husband .
Where you die I shall die , and there is where I shall be buried . May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should make a separation between me and you . ” ​ — Ruth 1 : 16 , 17 .
This history is an example of how Jehovah cherishes widows who draw close to him and trust in him .
Specific but Not Overbearing
When offering help to a widow , it is best to be clear and specific but not overbearing .
Many people will not ask for assistance when they need something ; instead , they suffer in silence .
While encouraging us to take an unselfish personal interest in people , it reminds us not to be busybodies . ​ — Philippians 2 : 4 ; 1 Peter 4 : 15 .
Those who act on these Bible principles truly “ honor widows . ”
People who are shown honor feel valued , cherished , dignified .
When Anna’s husband died after they had been married just seven years , she turned to Jehovah for comfort .
“ [ She ] was never missing from the temple , rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications . ”
He showed his love for her in a very special way by allowing her to see the baby who would grow up to be the Savior of the world .
How this thrilled and comforted Anna !
Clearly , she experienced the truth of Psalm 37 : 4 : “ Take exquisite delight in Jehovah , and he will give you the requests of your heart . ”
Elaine states : “ For a long time after David’s death , I had a physical pain , like a knife turning in my rib cage .
Congregation elders can especially offer friendship in a kindly way to grieving widows .
This government will soon eliminate all causes for sorrow , including death .
Yes , humans will be liberated from death and all the mourning and outcry it brings .
Being helpful means to strike a balance between respecting another’s privacy and being available when needed
Be Joyful With the Happy God
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why do many lack joy in life ?
Christians are not immune to the stresses and strains of these “ critical times hard to deal with , ” and it is not surprising that faithful servants of Jehovah sometimes become discouraged . ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 .
In what sense can it be said that everyone has at least some reasons to rejoice ?
Everyone has some blessings for which to be grateful .
If he finds employment , he will be able to work hard .
In the centuries that followed , the majority of mankind walked in the footsteps of Adam and Eve , but Jehovah did not turn his back on the human family because of such widespread disobedience .
Their imperfections were obvious , yet Jesus loved them .
Later , when he came to earth and actually “ resided among ” humans , his view of mankind did not change .
Name some ways in which we can imitate Jehovah and Jesus when it comes to maintaining our joy .
Let us see how some of these principles might be applied in a practical way in an area that is dear to the hearts of zealous Christians everywhere ​ — the field ministry .
Even if the majority refuse to respond to the good news , we have every reason to be joyful as we engage in the field ministry .
We must not forget that people’s circumstances change .
What took place in one town , and what can we learn from it ?
If someone did show interest in the Kingdom message , the neighbors lost no time in discouraging further contact with the Witnesses .
Needless to say , it was a challenge to preach there .
With what result ?
Imagine the joy of the Kingdom publishers who did not give up !
Millions of Jehovah’s dedicated servants turn first to Jehovah in prayer , then to their Christian brothers and sisters .
While on earth , Jesus himself valued the support of his disciples .
The doctors valiantly tried to save him , but Jonathan’s physical condition worsened until late one afternoon , he fell asleep in death .
Look at your congregation .
What do you see ?
She also studies the Bible with her children , trains them in the ministry , and brings them to congregation meetings .
18 , 19 .
They sorely miss their mates !
Their stable , positive attitude adds to the joy of the congregation !
Think of the progress they have made since they began studying the Bible .
Are we ?
Why can it be said that each congregation member plays an important role in the congregation ?
Are you married , single , or a single parent ?
And when you join in singing a Kingdom song , when you make a comment or handle a student assignment in the Theocratic Ministry School , your contribution adds to our joy .
Better still , it brings joy to Jehovah’s heart .
Is it possible to maintain our joy even in such situations ?
See Insight on the Scriptures , Volume 2 , page 119 , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
[ Pictures on page 10 ]
By counting their blessings , the greatest of which is having a close personal relationship with Jehovah , these faithful Christians were able to “ continue to rejoice . ”
Yes , those first - century Christians had a powerful hope .
They confidently looked forward to receiving something that could not be plundered ​ — the unfadable “ crown of life ” in God’s heavenly Kingdom .
( b ) What might cause a Christian to lose sight of his hope ?
Their faith that God would give them the promised crown of life undoubtedly sustained them in their suffering .
Further , we realize that “ time and unforeseen occurrence ” befall us all .
An accident can take the life of someone we love .
Is the coming Paradise real to me ?
Am I as eager for the end of the present system of things to come as I was when I first learned the truth ? ’
Paul further counseled the Romans to “ endure under tribulation . ”
At that , Paul , together with Luke , Silas , and Timothy , set sail for Europe .
Did this turn of events cause the zealous missionaries to lose their joy ?
When problems arise , reflecting on Jehovah’s goodness in his dealings with us helps us to “ rejoice in the hope . ”
David , whose life was far from trouble free , wrote : “ Many things you yourself have done , O Jehovah my God , even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us ; there is none to be compared to you . Were I inclined to tell and speak of them , they have become more numerous than I can recount . ”
He lives in a country where the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses was banned for many years .
For example , when a prisoner received a package from home , he shared its contents with fellow believers , who viewed these extra provisions as coming from Jehovah , the ultimate Giver of “ every good gift and every perfect present . ”
Ella , who also lives in a country where the Kingdom work was long banned , was arrested for sharing her Christian hope with others .
After more than five years , Ella was interrogated again .
And she added : “ If you do not want to release me , I will stay until Jehovah sees fit to deliver me . ”
She learned to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself .
Can you learn something from her example ? ​ — Hebrews 13 : 5 .
The more terrifying the situation , the deeper the peace became . ”
She did this , not in her own strength , but in the strength that Jehovah provided her .
Let us now discuss some other ways in which we can maintain our joy in Jehovah’s service .
A Christian couple invited an elder to their home for a meal .
Although they both had demanding full - time jobs , they were not in a position to look for other work .
They wondered how long they would be able to cope .
When asked for advice , the elder responded , “ Simplify . ”
The husband and his wife were spending up to three hours each day commuting to and from work .
He chose a very complicated design , although he had never built a house before .
At first , all went well , but in time the borrower began to renege .
Learning to go to bed at a reasonable hour may help put us back on track .
• Why should we try to simplify our lives ?

“ Jehovah Has Been Very Good to Me ! ”
Then , on January 3 , 2001 , at the age of 95 , Karl Klein faithfully completed his earthly course .
Karl became a member of the headquarters staff in 1925 , working first in the printery .
Many regular readers of The Watchtower will recall Brother Klein’s life story , an appealing account of his experiences that was published in the issue of October 1 , 1984 .
We have every reason to believe that Jehovah has now fulfilled that desire . ​ — Luke 22 : 28 - 30 .
Karl in 1943 with T .
Karl and Margareta , October 2000
Similarly , when the angel Gabriel announced the coming birth of Jesus to the virgin girl Mary , she said : “ My soul magnifies Jehovah . . . because the powerful One has done great deeds for me . ”
While banished by the Roman government to the isle of Patmos “ for speaking about God and bearing witness to Jesus , ” John received “ a revelation by Jesus Christ . ”
They fell down before God and said : “ You are worthy , Jehovah , even our God , to receive the glory and the honor and the power , because you created all things , and because of your will they existed and were created . ”
Declare Jehovah’s Praiseworthy Deeds !
Give examples of how David praised Jehovah .
For example , David sang : “ Make melody , you people , to Jehovah , who is dwelling in Zion ; tell among the peoples his deeds .
The book of Psalms contains many expressions of praise to God , and about half of these songs are attributed to David .
Moreover , since early times , divinely inspired compositions of David and others have been used to praise Jehovah .
What motivates us to praise Jehovah ?
When we reflect on the miraculous things Jehovah did for his people in times past , our hearts motivate us to laud him .
Jesus said that the first commandment is : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength . ”
David could not recount all of Jehovah’s wonderful works , and neither can we .
How is our hope bound up with God’s great deeds ?
Our hope for the future is bound up with the great and praiseworthy deeds associated with God’s eternal purpose .
After the rebellion in Eden , Jehovah gave the hope - filled first prophecy .
Jehovah brought the first reconciled ones together in the Christian congregation , established at Pentecost 33 C.E .
With the help of the holy spirit , they preached the good news far and wide , showing how Jesus ’ death and resurrection opens the way for obedient mankind to experience eternal blessings under the rule of God’s heavenly Kingdom .
The winds of destruction have been held back to allow for the sealing of the remaining ones of the 144,000 , who will rule with Christ in heaven .
As a result , an increasing number of “ other sheep ” are now becoming worshipers of Jehovah .
We rejoice that the opportunity is still open for meek ones of the earth to join us in praising Jehovah .
In recent years , he has ‘ opened large doors leading to activity . ’
This has made it possible for the good news to be proclaimed throughout vast territories where enemies of the truth formerly stood in the way .
They are fulfilling these prophetic words : “ This is what Jehovah of armies has said , ‘ It will be in those days that ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold , yes , they will actually take hold of the skirt of a man who is a Jew , saying : “ We will go with you people , for we have heard that God is with you people . ” ’ ”
Consult the current Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and note the lands now reporting from 100,000 to nearly 1,000,000 Kingdom publishers .
As Jehovah’s people , we praise and thank our heavenly Father for giving us real purpose in life , rewarding work in his service , and a bright outlook for the future .
We are thankful that Jehovah has moved the hearts of his people to ‘ honor him with their valuable things . ’
How should reflecting on Jehovah’s great and praiseworthy deeds affect us ?
• Why do you feel impelled to praise Jehovah ?
• How is our hope linked with God’s great deeds ?
Divine Guidance for Selecting a Marriage Mate
Both performances seem almost effortless .
Indeed , proper guidance is essential .
But the first man , Adam , did not choose his wife .
Is that not what we would expect of our loving Creator ? ​ — Psalm 19 : 8 .
That is why “ he has hated a divorcing , ” allowing it only on the grounds of “ fornication . ”
Why do young men and women especially need to be careful when choosing a mate , and how can they make the wisest decision ?
Indeed , a relationship founded solely on such factors can quickly erode into disdain or even hatred .
We also need to realize that what is best for us may not be what our heart initially desires .
It helps us to discern how we can make the wisest decisions in life .
While marriage can satisfy our inborn need for love and companionship , it also presents challenges requiring maturity and discernment .
As reality sets in , however , we may regret that we did not heed the wise counsel offered for our good .
How sad it would be if an arrangement that could have brought us great happiness becomes a source of much distress !
As we can see , Paul’s inspired words emphasize the need for love and respect .
It requires a wholehearted commitment through both good times and bad .
They do show , however , that it is better to wait until we are “ past the bloom of youth , ” when strong sexual impulses can distort good judgment .
When contemplating marriage , it is important to have a mature understanding of all that is involved .
Premature marriage can bring a host of problems that a youthful couple are likely ill - prepared to handle .
Marriage should be undertaken only when we are physically , mentally , and spiritually ready to take on an enduring partnership .
He was a full - time pioneer minister , and they wanted to get married .
Within the year , I matured some and began to see that this young man did not have the qualities that would make for a good marriage mate .
‘ Marry Only in the Lord ’
This can have a detrimental effect on communication and on marital happiness .
When we comply with God’s Word , our hearts do not condemn us , for we are doing what is “ pleasing in his eyes . ” ​ — 1 John 3 : 21 , 22 .
When contemplating marriage , to what important matters should attention be given , and why ?
When marriage is considered , the virtue and spirituality of the prospective mate should be of primary concern .
And the greatest strength a couple can achieve comes from mutual devotion to the Creator and full acceptance of his guidance .
Building a Spiritually Strong Family
What was God’s purpose for the family , but what happened instead ?
Adam’s offspring had what abilities , but what would be needed to build a spiritually strong family ?
As sinners , however , they would need to pay considerable attention in order to build a spiritually strong family .
If you are a parent , how can you do this ?
First , establish priorities , giving attention to “ the more important things , ” including the teaching and training of your children .
But do not leave this to chance .
This does not mean just being in the same house , each one doing his own thing .
Instead , they will view it as a blessed privilege . ​ — Genesis 33 : 5 ; Psalm 127 : 3 .
Teach by Word and Example
God counsels parents to set the example for their children , to communicate with them , and to teach them .
What example shows the value of training children from an early age , and to whom is the credit for success due ?
The value of training children from an early age can be seen in an example from Venezuela .
In time , Felito became a regular pioneer .
His parents comment : “ As we watch our son’s progress , we realize that we owe it to Jehovah and his instruction . ”
( b ) What resulted when a certain Japanese girl pursued her goal ?
Appropriate goals include reading the Bible daily , becoming a regular publisher of the good news , and progressing to dedication and baptism .
While in elementary school , a Japanese girl named Ayumi made it her goal to witness to everyone in her class .
To arouse the interest of her teacher and classmates , she obtained permission to place several Bible publications in the library .
As a result , 13 Bible studies were arranged for during her six years in elementary school .
How can children derive the greatest benefit from Christian meetings ?
13 , 14 . ( a ) Why should parents work with their children in the ministry ?
Wise parents will direct the youthful energy of their children toward serving Jehovah , helping them to make preaching an important part of their lives .
Only by working with their children in the ministry can parents make sure that their young ones will get the training needed to become ministers “ with nothing to be ashamed of , handling the word of the truth aright . ”
Doing this will help to make the ministry joyful , meaningful , and productive for them .
At the same time , parents can observe the attitude , deportment , and ability of their children .
If possible , let each child have his own witnessing case , and teach him or her to keep it neat and presentable .
Maintain Spirituality
Do you remember to thank Jehovah in prayer for each day of life and for his bountiful provisions “ when you lie down and when you get up ” ?
Rather than always telling them what to do , why not show them how to find God’s viewpoint on matters by encouraging them to do research on their own ?
What about single - parent families ?
Of course , Christians who are single parents need to rely fully on Jehovah .
They must have faith that he will provide help . ​ — Psalm 121 : 1 - 3 .
To what mental and physical needs of their children should parents give attention , but on what should emphasis be placed ?
Upbuilding music and especially singing songs of praise to God will help a child to develop a healthy attitude that can play an important role in strengthening his relationship with Jehovah .
The miraculous way in which they were saved was in itself unmistakable evidence that God was with them .
( b ) What did some Jews , and later many non - Jews , come to realize ?
Even when confronted with the fact that Jesus was resurrected after they had put him to death , they were unwilling to admit that this was of God’s doing .
Rather , they took the lead in persecuting Jesus ’ followers , trying to hinder their work of “ declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus . ”
To them it was obvious that God had rejected the self - righteous Jewish leaders and was backing the humble followers of Jesus Christ . ​ — Acts 11 : 19 - 21 .
Granted , true religion does make people better .
But does the fact that a religion produces better people in itself prove that it has God’s backing ?
Is that the sole criterion for determining if a religion is true ?
Let us review some of the “ fruits , ” or identifying marks , of true religion so that we in all honesty can determine who today has divine backing .
They base their teachings on the Bible .
Therefore , whether Jew or non - Jew , Christians were to serve as “ a people for [ God’s ] name . ”
( a ) Why does joy characterize members of the true religion ?
They reflect God’s joyful personality .
My own servants will eat , but you yourselves will go hungry .
( a ) Why can members of the true religion not be divided into a clergy and a laity class ?
They are organized in the manner of the first - century Christian congregation .
Jesus set out the principle : “ Do not you be called Rabbi , for one is your teacher , whereas all you are brothers .
Moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
Those shepherding the flock of God are told to do so “ not under compulsion , but willingly ; neither for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”
Genuine Christian shepherds refrain from trying to make themselves masters over the faith of others .
What balanced position regarding human governments does God require of those desiring to have his backing ?
They are submissive to human governments and yet remain neutral .
Because “ the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God .
What part does love play in identifying God’s people ?
Christian love knows no partiality , accepting all people regardless of their skin color , economic or educational status , nationality , or language .
They are willing to suffer persecution for doing God’s will .
Today , those desiring God’s backing dare not water down God’s word or compromise godly principles so as to avoid persecution .
What group is noted for having no paid clergy , all of its members being preachers ?
And despite all of these positive things , who are still looked down on , ridiculed , and persecuted ? ’
They have reached this conclusion on the basis of what Jehovah’s Witnesses teach and how they conduct themselves , as well as on the basis of the benefits their religion has brought .
Is it presumptuous of Jehovah’s Witnesses to point out that they alone have God’s backing ?
Actually , no more so than when the Israelites in Egypt claimed to have God’s backing in spite of the Egyptians ’ belief , or when first - century Christians claimed to have God’s backing to the exclusion of Jewish religionists .
How did the Devil react to the Kingdom’s birth , and of what is this an evidence ?
The gradual developments involving God’s earthly organizational arrangement and their positive results were foretold at Isaiah 60 : 17 : “ Instead of the copper I shall bring in gold , and instead of the iron I shall bring in silver , and instead of the wood , copper , and instead of the stones , iron ; and I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners . ”
These positive changes reflected divine blessing and evidenced God’s approval of those who had come out in zealous support of his Kingdom .
For example , in 1931 this small group of Christians went on public record that they were more than just Bible Students .
Even in lands normally known for religious liberty , such as the United States , Canada , and Germany , the Witnesses were repeatedly forced to fight legal battles to retain their freedom of worship .
By 1988 , the U.S . Supreme Court had reviewed 71 cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses , two thirds of which were decided in their favor .
Today , throughout the world , legal battles continue so that , as in the first century , there can be a “ defending and legally establishing of the good news . ” ​ — Philippians 1 : 7 .
During the 1930 ’ s , in the days leading up to World War II , dictatorial governments placed bans or restrictions upon the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany , Spain , and Japan , to name only three .
But in the year 2000 , these three countries alone had almost 500,000 active proclaimers of God’s Kingdom .
What outstanding event took place in 1958 , and what dramatic change has taken place since ?
But the Witnesses were still under ban in the huge Soviet Union and in its allied nations in the Warsaw Pact .
Today , in these former Communist nations , there are well over half a million active Witnesses .
Along the way , this ever - growing new world society has acquired know - how that has proved invaluable today and perhaps even will during post - Armageddon restoration work .
This is mainly because of the Witnesses ’ Bible - based position on such matters as blood transfusions , neutrality , smoking , and morals .
The discussion was triggered by an article that appeared that day in the Polish daily Dziennik Zachodni .
Give an example of how prominent individuals have praised the stand taken by Jehovah’s Witnesses as regards political neutrality .
( b ) Give examples of favorable comments that have been made in behalf of God’s people today .
This often opens the way for them to speak with people never before willing to listen .
Such actions are therefore welcome , and Jehovah’s Witnesses truly appreciate them .
Like Gamaliel , prominent individuals have recently spoken out in favor of religious freedom for Jehovah’s Witnesses .
And a professor of the scientific study of religion at the university of Leipzig posed a pertinent question as regards a German government commission set up to investigate so - called religious sects , asking : “ Why should only religious minorities come under scrutiny but not the two large churches [ the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church ] ? ”
( b ) How were three other influential individuals limited in what they could do in behalf of Jesus ?
Even two members of the Sanhedrin , Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea , who were favorable to Jesus , were limited in what they could do to prevent the court from taking action against Jesus .
From its very beginning , true religion has faced strong opposition .
“ The kings of the entire inhabited earth , ” under the guidance of Satan , “ will battle with the Lamb , but , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings , the Lamb will conquer them . ”
• What has Jehovah done to strengthen the Christian congregation since the Kingdom’s birth ?
Witness neutrality during World War II is still bringing praise to Jehovah
Kingdom Proclaimers Report
His Spiritual Needs Were Satisfied
In Bible times , Cyprus was renowned for its copper and fine timber .
Certainly this is true of Lucas , a man in his 40 ’ s .
It did not last long , however , because some of the older people in the village called us heretics .
I spent many days in the university library studying different religions .
Since I was taught from childhood that the Greek Orthodox Church had the truth , I relented and stopped visiting with Antonis and started discussing the Bible with the theologian .
I also visited many monasteries in Cyprus .
“ My wife and our two oldest daughters , age 14 and 10 at the time , were initially opposed .
She was particularly impressed by their use of the Bible .
Imagine my delight when the three of them were baptized at the “ God’s Prophetic Word ” District Convention in 1999 !
Now our entire family , including my wife and four children , are united in the pure worship of Jehovah . ”
“ As Catholics we haven’t always been exposed to the Bible , ” says Kay Murdy of the Catholic Bible Institute in Los Angeles , “ but that’s changing . ”
Once Catholics become aware of how the Holy Scriptures can affect their life , she notes , “ they develop their own hunger and thirst for the Bible . ”

Do Not Become Forgetful Hearers
Still , the same thing could happen to us .
Above all , through the sacrificial death of God’s own Son , Jesus Christ , we have received the hope of salvation .
He wrote : “ Become doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves with false reasoning .
This knowledge should motivate us to make adjustments in our personality .
It is as if we forget God’s loving acts in our behalf .
What Scriptural consideration can help us not to forget Jehovah’s word ?
What undeniable evidence of Jehovah’s love did the Israelites receive ?
Yes , those Israelites received undeniable evidence of Jehovah’s love for them .
What were the consequences of Israel’s spiritual forgetfulness ?
What can we learn from this ?
The Israelites had plenty to keep them spiritually focused while in the wilderness .
We must be determined “ to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things . ”
11 , 12 .
Concerning those “ walking as the enemies of the torture stake of the Christ , ” he wrote : “ Their finish is destruction , and their god is their belly . ”
The Israelites disobeyed clear direction from Jehovah .
They heard the Ten Commandments and were present when Moses gave them God’s command : “ You must not make along with me gods of silver , and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves . ”
What were the consequences of worshiping the golden calf ?
What a lesson for any who read God’s Word but choose for themselves what they want to obey !
They have become forgetful hearers .
To Christians in Rome , Paul wrote : “ Your obedience has come to the notice of all .
Paul admonishes us : “ Neither let us put Jehovah to the test , as some of [ the Israelites ] put him to the test , only to perish by the serpents .
In writing to fellow Christians , Paul concludes the list of warnings with the exhortation : “ Now these things went on befalling them as examples , and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived .
When life’s anxieties weigh us down , let us reflect on the wonderful promises found in his Word .
How Would You Answer ?
The Israelites forgot Jehovah’s mighty deeds in their behalf
“ [ Moses ] continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible . ” ​ — HEBREWS 11 : 27 .
And the apostle John wrote : “ No man has seen God at any time . ”
But humans who are “ pure in heart ” and have the hope of living forever on earth are also able to “ see ” God .
Such seeing is based on accurate knowledge and is perceived spiritually with ‘ the eyes of the heart . ’
Jesus perfectly reflected Jehovah’s personality .
Spirituality Is Vital
How is lack of spirituality manifested by many today ?
Today , faith and true spirituality are rare indeed .
“ Faith is not a possession of all people , ” said Paul .
The Scriptures tell us that “ the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground . ”
Clearly , his strong spirituality and the conviction that God was with him gave Moses the strength needed to represent ‘ the invisible One ’ before Egypt’s ruthless king .
What is one way that we can continue steadfast ?
Jesus warned his disciples : “ You will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name . ”
If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . ”
How does our confidence in Jehovah’s protective care help us in the ministry ?
Like Moses , Jesus ’ early followers were not intimidated by their many visible enemies .
The Invisible One Directs His People
According to Peter and Jude , how did some who were associated with the Christian congregation manifest a lack of spirituality ?
Isaiah prophesied : “ Your eyes must become eyes seeing your Grand Instructor . ”
When reading the Watchtower and Awake ! magazines , perhaps we even skip certain articles because the subject matter is not of particular interest to us .
However , we can remain alert if we reason carefully on the points under consideration .
We Must Render an Account
When others do not see them , they may engage in unscriptural conduct .
For instance , some have not resisted the temptation to view harmful entertainment and pornography on the Internet , television , and other forms of modern technology .
Since involvement in such things can take place in private , some have acted as though their conduct were invisible to Jehovah .
The Bible reminds us : “ There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight , but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting . ”
With what kind of interest does Jehovah observe us ?
Because Jehovah observes us and notes our faithfulness , what assurance do we receive from the Scriptures ?
As Jehovah’s faithful servants , we are precious to him .
Our strong faith helps us to have a clean heart and a good conscience before Jehovah .
Moreover , such faith promotes godly conduct , making Jehovah’s heart rejoice . ​ — Proverbs 27 : 11 .
( b ) How may we apply Psalm 139 : 23 , 24 to ourselves ?
Not only do we want him to see us but we also desire that he make a thorough examination of our thoughts and actions .
He can certainly help us to cope with our problems and to make any needed adjustments .
But what if we are troubled by anxiety over some error or there is something hurtful within us ?
• How is it possible for humans to see God ?
Let us never act as if Jehovah cannot see what we do
Philip explained the meaning of the passage the man had been reading and went on to declare to him “ the good news about Jesus . ” ​ — Acts 8 : 30 - 35 .
They would be happy to help you too .
As you progress , you will be able to take in what the apostle Paul called “ solid food ” ​ — that is , deeper truths .
Although it is the Bible that you are studying , other publications ​ — Bible study aids — ​ can help you to locate and understand Bible passages on a variety of subjects .
The answers in the Bible were very exciting .
They feel like the man in Jesus ’ parable who discovered a treasure hidden in a field .
The Key to a Meaningful Life
Though profound , it is not complicated .
Let us consider two scriptures supporting that statement .
What the Fear of God Means
But fear of God ​ — or godly fear — ​ is awe and profound reverence for the Creator .
The two are actually linked .
Just think of the feeling of respect and awe that a child has for a strong and wise father .
That is why a study of the Bible is so important .
The initial outburst of joy that I felt has developed into a truly joyful way of life .
[ Picture on page 6 ]
Whatever the case , the Bible makes it clear that God had taken time not only to give instructions to the first man but also to teach him what he needed to know in order to carry out his responsibilities . ​ — Genesis 1 : 28 - 30 .
Jehovah gave Adam and Eve life , dominion over the animals , and authority over the entire earth .
Their descendants inherited sin and its consequence , death . ​ — Romans 5 : 12 .
Cain , the firstborn son of Adam and Eve , was in danger of being overcome by sin .
Thus , the first three humans on earth all spurned the clear direction provided by the one who gave them life , the God who gives instruction to his people so that they might benefit themselves .
Jehovah communicated his will to faithful patriarchs of old , such as Noah , Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and Job .
Later , through Moses he set out an entire code of laws for the nation of Israel .
The Law even provided dietary and sanitary regulations that promoted good health .
One wrote : “ Your word is a lamp to my foot , and a light to my roadway . ”
Today , we live in an era called “ the last days , ” an era marked by “ critical times hard to deal with . ”
The prophet Daniel foretold that during this time “ the true knowledge [ would ] become abundant . ”
They also know that he will soon bring an end to all wickedness and transform the earth into a global paradise .
One leads to destruction .
The other road leads to everlasting life .
Are you among those who have chosen the road to life ?
Jesus further said : “ No man can come to me unless the Father , who sent me , draws him . ”
Bible prophecies show us where we are in the stream of time and give us confidence in God’s promises for the future .
How does heeding God’s Word benefit us physically ?
For example , we learn to avoid practices that defile our bodies , such as the misuse of tobacco and other drugs .
Bible truth caused them to make major changes ; they were “ washed clean . ”
Surely the truth is a treasure far beyond compare .
“ The faithful and discreet slave ” supplies spiritual food at the proper time , including Bibles , magazines , and other publications in a multitude of languages .
Thirty - six secondary articles were considered from the Watchtower magazine in addition to 52 study articles .
We also enjoy the support of mature fellow Christians who are willing to help us spiritually .
Think of the blessing that we have in our multiracial brotherhood !
He imparts healthful teachings to all who listen , and he delights in the obedience of those whom he teaches , just as parents rejoice when their children respond to loving instruction . ​ — Proverbs 27 : 11 .
Similarly , when on earth Jesus was happy to see people respond positively to his teaching .
Giving Brings Joy
( b ) Why is imparting Bible truth to our children an expression of love ?
Yes , just as Jehovah and Jesus rejoice in imparting spiritual gifts , Christians do also .
You certainly are our glory and joy . ”
In like manner the apostle John , referring to his spiritual children , wrote : “ No greater cause for thankfulness do I have than these things , that I should be hearing that my children go on walking in the truth . ”
When these respond , parents experience great joy and satisfaction .
When we thus cooperate with Almighty God and his beloved Son , our lives take on real meaning .
What a blessing it is to be counted among God’s “ fellow workers ” !
As we strive to do God’s will , we too can become God’s friends .
If we do that , we also become friends of Jesus .
Though Thelma encountered family opposition to her study , she persevered and was baptized a year later .
Joan wrote : “ Our association did not end there ; rather , it developed into a friendship that has lasted for about 35 years now .
What did Jesus say about treasures in heaven , and what can we learn from this ?
The apostle Paul wrote : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ” ​ — Hebrews 6 : 10 .
( a ) Why did Jesus have spiritual treasures ?
Why are spiritual gifts better than material ones ?
But what will be the condition of that gift in 20 years ?
On the other hand , if you give of yourself to help a person serve Jehovah , he or she can benefit from that gift forever .
How have many given of themselves to help others spiritually ?
Thousands have left home and family to take up missionary service in lands where they have had to adapt to new languages and cultures .
The wise man wrote : “ In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest ; for you are not knowing where this will have success . ”
In the meantime , remember such faithful men as Noah and Jeremiah .
To Jehovah , a life spent in his service is beautiful .
We can look for opportunities to show hospitality to others .
We can strive to “ work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith . ”
Can You Explain ?
• How can all in the congregation share in the joy of giving ?

Trees That Stand the Test of Time
A cliff might not seem to be the ideal place to make your home , especially if it is located high up in the mountains .
USUALLY , these hardy trees are not as majestic as their lowland cousins .
Their trunks may be gnarled and twisted and their growth considerably stunted .
Some even look like natural bonsai ​ — shaped and pruned by the harsh climate and the scanty soil in which they grow .
Some claim that Methuselah , a bristlecone pine growing at an elevation of 10,000 feet [ 3,000 m ] in the White Mountains of California , is 4,700 years old .
Schulman also discovered that the oldest specimens of other pines likewise grew in harsh conditions .
They too may face adversity because of the circumstances in which they find themselves .
Nevertheless , their Creator , who designed the trees that withstand adversity so well , assures his worshipers that he will support them .
The Bible promises those who stand their ground : “ He will make you firm , he will make you strong . ” ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 9 , 10 .
“ As you have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord , ” Paul wrote , “ go on walking in union with him , rooted and being built up in him and being stabilized in the faith , just as you were taught , overflowing with faith in thanksgiving . ” ​ — Colossians 2 : 6 , 7 .
Paul appreciated the need for strong spiritual roots .
He himself struggled with “ a thorn in the flesh , ” and he endured bitter persecution throughout his ministry .
As the example of Paul shows , successful Christian endurance does not depend on favorable circumstances .
Like alpine trees that successfully weather storms for centuries , we can stand our ground if we are rooted in Christ and depend on the power that God imparts .
Lyman was first assigned to the bindery , then to the pressroom , and he also helped make ink .
Lyman was a bold proclaimer of God’s Kingdom .
In his early years in Brooklyn , he and his roommate , Arthur Worsley , used to sail one of the Witnesses ’ boats up the Hudson River .
There , in 1913 , his parents became Bible Students , as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called .
They were inseparable , sharing in the ministry together until Crystal’s death in 1998 .
to passersby .
Like his father and mother , he entertained the Bible - based hope of living with Jesus Christ in the heavenly Kingdom , a hope that we are confident he has now realized . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 15 - 18 ; Revelation 14 : 13 .
[ Picture on page 31 ]
He had preached the good news there and had undoubtedly helped some Colossians to become disciples of Jesus Christ .
Epaphras was deeply concerned about fellow believers in Colossae , for from Rome the apostle Paul wrote them : “ Epaphras . . . sends you his greetings , always exerting himself in your behalf in his prayers , that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God . ” ​ — Colossians 4 : 12 .
Seen here is some of the literature that has helped hundreds of thousands of youths to “ stand complete and with firm conviction . ”
Let us consider a few of these publications .
“ Behold , ” exclaimed Brother Rutherford , “ more than 15,000 new witnesses to the Kingdom ! ”
The speaker added : “ All of you who will do what you can to tell others about God’s kingdom . . . , please say Aye . ”
Then he displayed the new book Children , which was received with prolonged applause .
They support local congregations , are Bethel volunteers , or serve as missionaries in foreign lands .
During the 1970 ’ s , Jehovah’s Witnesses published three more books that reached the hearts of hundreds of thousands of young people .
At the “ Godly Devotion ” District Convention that year , the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work was released .
Thank you for your concern for our well - being . ”
It triggered an enthusiastic response .
“ It has helped me to stand up to my peers . ”
And what a joy it is to see how such Scriptural instruction is helping young people today to “ stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God ” !
WHEN we recall the day of our baptism as one of Jehovah’s servants , whether it occurred a few years ago or many , it may seem as though it took place yesterday .
As we bought out the opportune time to help others to hear and possibly accept the Kingdom message , joyful service to Jehovah was our major concern .
What contributes to the joy we experience in the figurative harvest work ?
As Christians , we are engaged in a figurative harvest work .
Since we are participating in such harvesting activity , it will be encouraging to examine the joy of the early Christian harvest workers .
Sent Forth as Harvest Workers
In what respect did Jesus ’ early followers experience joy ?
The commission Jesus gave them rang in their ears .
In what activity did the apostles engage in the first century ?
And his harvesting work was surely effective , for in writing to Christians in Corinth in about 55 C.E . , he said : “ I make known to you , brothers , the good news which I declared to you , which you also received , in which you also stand . ”
The apostles and other early Christians were industrious harvest workers .
Paul reasoned with the Jews in their synagogue and with people on hand in the marketplace in Athens .
Illustrate .
When a Witness in England and her companion observed visitors leaving regularly by bus after enjoying a day at the coast , they summoned up courage to board the buses and present copies of The Watchtower and Awake !
Another reason for our joy relates to the peace - making attitude we display in the harvest work .
For those who do , there is the prospect of reconciliation with God as they repent of their sins , turn around , and do his will .
A Fine Goal for Harvest Workers
And what joy we experience when a person to whom we preach responds favorably , wants to learn more , and proves to be “ a friend of peace ” !
With the help of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and such brochures as What Does God Require of Us ? , we can conduct effective home Bible studies and can thus share in assisting newly interested ones to become disciples .
When we help new ones with answers to their questions , let us also do what we can to teach them how they can answer those who question them .
Although we now see that ‘ populous nation ’ of anointed ones virtually complete , our joy is abundant as we observe the number of other harvest workers growing year by year . ​ — Psalm 4 : 7 ; Zechariah 8 : 23 ; John 10 : 16 .
We certainly have sound reasons to keep on rejoicing in the harvest work .
Studies were organized first at locations where groups of interested people could be gathered .
Preaching in the 1st and 20th centuries
[ Pictures on page 13 ]
Press On in the Harvest Work !
Jehovah God , the Master of the harvest , has answered the plea to send out more workers .
Thus , the apostle Paul wrote : “ It seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men appointed to death , because we [ the apostles ] have become a theatrical spectacle to the world , and to angels , and to men . ”
Yes , we have angelic support in our ministry ​ — our harvest work ! ​ — Hebrews 1 : 13 , 14 .
“ Objects of Hatred ”
Jesus added : “ Be on your guard against men ; for they will deliver you up to local courts , and they will scourge you in their synagogues . Why , you will be haled before governors and kings for my sake , for a witness to them and the nations . . . .
Our enemies observe our spiritual prosperity but refuse to attribute it to Jehovah .
During a series of Christian conventions from 1922 to 1928 , for instance , judgment messages on Satan’s wicked system of things rang out clearly .
In the late 1930 ’ s , another form of witnessing activity opened up ​ — information marches .
Our bold witnessing on the world stage helps us search out deserving ones .
They have heeded God’s judgment messages and have become united with the anointed ones in preaching the lifesaving good news .
13 , 14 . ( a ) What comfort can be drawn from Psalm 126 : 5 , 6 ?
( b ) If we continue to sow and water , what will happen ?
We may shed tears when under trial or when we or our fellow believers are suffering for righteousness ’ sake .
* He read it with interest .
Persecuted yet Joyful
Jesus further said : “ Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth ; I came to put , not peace , but a sword . ”
How are those who uphold God’s sovereignty set apart , and what is one example of this ?
For instance , consider how our fellow worshipers stood out as different because they ‘ paid Caesar’s things to Caesar but God’s things to God ’ in the days of National Socialism in Germany .
How much longer Jehovah will allow us to engage in the figurative harvest work remains to be seen .
How did Jesus indicate that an abundant spiritual harvest was at hand , and how has this proved true in recent years ?
After witnessing to a Samaritan woman near Sychar in 30 C.E . , Jesus spoke of the spiritual harvest .
He told his disciples : “ Lift up your eyes and view the fields , that they are white for harvesting .
Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life , so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together . ”
• How has the Master of the harvest answered the plea for more workers ?
You probably cherish your right to believe whatever you wish to believe .
BUT there is a need for caution .
Early in the 20th century , for example , some people came to believe that Jews and Freemasons had plans to “ disrupt Christian civilization and erect a world state under their joint rule . ”
‘ This preposterous fiction , ’ says Mark Jones of the British Museum , ‘ spread abroad from Russia , ’ where it first appeared in a newspaper article in 1903 .
How many people have met untimely deaths doing something they believed was right ?
Then again , often we believe a thing simply because we want to believe it .
Their beliefs becloud their critical judgment .
Then they may spend a lifetime in vain trying to shore up mistaken beliefs . ​ — Jeremiah 17 : 9 .
Another believes that when you die you cease to exist , totally and completely .
1921 article exposing “ Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion ”
To believe has been defined as “ to accept as true , genuine , or real . ”
Is that always wise ?
Yet , obviously in these and other religious struggles and fights , something was terribly wrong .
The young man Timothy , for example , benefited greatly from listening to his mother and grandmother .
Jesus respected her freedom to choose what she wanted to believe , but he also pointed out to her : “ You worship what you do not know . ”
A wise person , therefore , does not blindly believe that something is true simply because some authoritative teacher says it is . ​ — Psalm 146 : 3 .
It led to his “ persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it . ”
They begin to believe that “ good is bad and bad is good . ” ​ — Isaiah 5 : 20 ; 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 , 10 .
Yes , of course he would !
We have no hesitation in saying that God’s Word , the Bible , provides the only basis for doing this . ​ — John 17 : 17 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 16 , 17 .
Well , it is true that religious leaders who claim to follow the Bible have produced many confusing and conflicting ideas .
“ Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord . ” ​ — EPHESIANS 5 : 10 .
In what way can life today be perplexing , and why ?
Jeremiah’s insightful observation applies to us today with added force .
We are reminded of the apostle Paul’s words : “ Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else , do all things for God’s glory . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 10 : 31 ; Colossians 4 : 6 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 9 , 10 .
Then there are choices that are of even more serious concern .
To be sure , choosing the right person to marry , to be one’s lifelong partner , is no small matter .
On the other hand , the intellectual circle of the day was abuzz not only with the philosophical ideas of Plato and Aristotle but also with those of the newer schools , such as the Epicureans and the Stoics .
When the apostle Paul came to Athens on his second missionary tour , he was confronted by Epicurean and Stoic philosophers who felt that they were superior to “ this chatterer , ” Paul . ​ — Acts 17 : 18 .
Those who were part and parcel of the system seemed to enjoy many benefits and advantages , and the choices they made appeared to be sound .
That in itself may be beneficial .
Paul , however , coupled “ philosophy ” with “ empty deception . ”
In practically every field of human endeavor , there are experts galore .
Often , Bible standards on morality are put aside to make room for the so - called new morality .
How have Isaiah’s words about good and bad proved true ?
The fact that God called to account those ancient Jews who became “ wise in their own eyes ” makes it all the more important for us to avoid relying on ourselves in determining right and wrong .
Many people today subscribe to the notion of “ just listen to your heart , ” or “ do what you feel is right . ”
If anything , you would probably do just the opposite of what such a person tells you .
That is why the Bible reminds us : “ He that is trusting in his own heart is stupid , but he that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape . ” ​ — Proverbs 3 : 5 - 7 ; 28 : 26 .
Learning What Is Acceptable to God
Jesus Christ emphasized this need when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their taking in knowledge of you , the only true God , and of the one whom you sent forth , Jesus Christ . ”
The expression “ taking in knowledge ” has a far deeper meaning than simply “ knowing . ”
Here Paul contrasted “ milk , ” which he described in the preceding verse as “ the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God , ” with “ solid food , ” which belongs to “ mature people , ” who “ have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ” ​ — Hebrews 5 : 12 - 14 .
This means that , first of all , we must work hard to gain an accurate understanding of God’s standards as contained in his Word , the Bible .
Rather , Paul explained : “ All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight , for disciplining in righteousness , that the man of God may be fully competent , completely equipped for every good work . ”
All of this is the result of rigorous training and incessant practice .
What is suggested by the expression “ through use ” in Paul’s explanation about training one’s perceptive powers ?

• What ability is needed to make sound decisions ?
[ Picture on page 9 ]
Like a gymnast , we must have full control of all our senses and body members
We recognize maturity in a person when we see discernment , insight , wisdom , and so on .
What did Jesus ’ description of the people of his day reveal about maturity ?
On the other hand , a person may be grown physically , but the way he talks and acts may reveal that he is immature emotionally and spiritually .
Thus , he added : “ All the same , wisdom is proved righteous by its works . ” ​ — Matthew 11 : 16 - 19 .
How can maturity be defined ?
To the Christians in Ephesus , the apostle Paul wrote : “ He gave some as apostles , some as prophets , some as evangelizers , some as shepherds and teachers , with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones , for ministerial work , for the building up of the body of the Christ , until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God , to a full - grown man , to the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ ; in order that we should no longer be babes , tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men , by means of cunning in contriving error . ” ​ — Ephesians 4 : 11 - 14 .
In fact , how can a Christian be in oneness with fellow believers if he only believes or accepts a certain part of “ the faith ” ?
Rather , we should be interested in taking advantage of all of Jehovah’s provisions through his organization to dig deeply into his Word .
Regarding the expression “ we all , ” one Bible handbook gives the meaning as “ not all , one by one , separately , but all together . ”
The Interpreter’s Bible observes : “ The fullness of spiritual achievement is not to be attained by the individual in isolation , just as one part of the body cannot reach its mature development except as the whole body continues its healthy growth . ”
( a ) What does making spiritual advancement not imply ?
( b ) What do we need to do to make advancement ?
It is clear from Paul’s words that making spiritual advancement does not mean merely filling our mind with knowledge and great learning .
Yes , it is “ the path , ” not the individual , that is “ getting lighter and lighter . ”
While attaining “ the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge ” is important , it is equally important for us to manifest the fruitage of God’s spirit in every aspect of our life .
Why ?
Paul went on to list “ the works of the flesh , ” which are numerous and “ manifest . ”
Before a person comes to appreciate God’s requirements , his life is patterned after the ways of the world and may be filled with some of the things Paul mentioned : “ fornication , uncleanness , loose conduct , idolatry , practice of spiritism , enmities , strife , jealousy , fits of anger , contentions , divisions , sects , envies , drunken bouts , revelries , and things like these . ”
Explain the two expressions “ the works of the flesh ” and “ the fruitage of the spirit . ”
Just as a tree will bear fruit when it is properly tended , so a person will manifest the fruitage of the spirit when holy spirit flows freely in his life . ​ — Psalm 1 : 1 - 3 .
* The spirit does not produce a variety of fruits for us to pick our favorite .
It is to gain a free flow of God’s spirit in our life .
To the extent that our thinking and actions are responsive to the leading of God’s spirit , to that extent we become spiritually mature .
How can we achieve this objective ?
We must open our heart and mind to the influence of God’s spirit .
( b ) What challenge does this harvest present ?
This makes us happy and undoubtedly also makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice .
On the other hand , if you have been in the truth for some time , will you accept the challenge to shoulder the responsibility of caring for the spiritual welfare of new ones ?
Stay by these things , for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you . ”
By diligently making your advancement manifest , you too can share in the privilege of glorifying God’s name and enjoying his blessings .
[ Footnote ]
• What kind of knowledge and understanding reflect maturity ?
Prayer helps us to manifest “ the fruitage of the spirit ”
“ For example , I stopped worshiping my ancestors , even though this led to opposition from my family .
This gave me the courage to leave him .
“ Leaving a large comfortable house for a small apartment was not easy .
What is more , my former companion pressured me to come to live with him again , even threatening to disfigure me with acid if I refused .

He thus became the figurative father of all who would put faith in the promised Seed .
In a sense , Abraham can be considered our father , for his faith serves as an example to be imitated .
The Command to Leave Ur
Abram was a descendant of God - fearing Shem .
Imported goods could be purchased in Ur’s bazaars .
( b ) How did Abram come to put faith in Jehovah ?
According to some Jewish traditions , Abram’s father , Terah , was himself a maker of idols .
His aged forefather Shem was still alive and no doubt shared his knowledge of the true God .
Abram’s faith was to be put to the test .
How could he be made into “ a great nation ” ?
How might Christians today face tests like those faced by Abram ?
Christians today may face similar tests .
Abram thus set a fine example for us .
What about Abram’s immediate family members ?
The Bible thus credits him , as family head , with making the move toward Canaan .
What preparations did Abram have to make for his journey , and why might that have involved sacrifice ?
Abram may have suffered financial loss in making such hurried preparations , but he was delighted to obey Jehovah .
So Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot the son of his brother and all the goods that they had accumulated and the souls whom they had acquired in Haran , and they got on their way out to go to the land of Canaan . ” ​ — Genesis 11 : 32 ; 12 : 4 , 5 .
What did Abram do while living in Haran ?
Clearly , this was due to God’s blessing .
While God does not promise wealth to all his people today , he is faithful to his promise to provide for the needs of those who ‘ leave homes , brothers , or sisters ’ for the sake of the Kingdom .
Abram also ‘ acquired souls , ’ that is , a body of servants .
“ At that Abram went just as Jehovah had spoken to him . ” ​ — Genesis 12 : 4 .
Leaving Haran behind , his caravan headed west , traveling some 55 miles [ 90 km ] .
Says Exodus 12 : 41 : “ It came about at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , it even came about on this very day that all the armies of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt . ”
( b ) In what sense are God’s people today more blessed than Abram ?
Today , we are blessed to have a far more extensive understanding of God’s purposes than did Abram .
Since the Canaanites were morally perverse , Abram would have to take pains to protect his family from their corrupting influence . ​ — Exodus 34 : 11 - 16 .
How did Abram prove himself to be a preacher of God’s name , and of what does this remind Christians today ?
The Hebrew phrase “ call on the name ” also means “ declare ( preach ) the name . ”
All the while , they avoided getting too close to their pagan neighbors .
They dined on the products of their flocks instead of on food purchased at one of Ur’s well - stocked bazaars ; they lived in tents instead of a well - built home .
Would Abram’s faith prove equal to the challenge ?
Thus , Abram could later be referred to as coming from “ the other side of the [ Euphrates ] River . ” ​ — Joshua 24 : 3 .
Centuries later , Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II used rafts to cross the Euphrates near Carchemish .
• Why is Abram called “ the father of all those having faith ” ?
Based on a map copyrighted by Pictorial Archive ( Near Eastern History ) Est . and Survey of Israel [ Picture on page 15 ]
How did Abram cope with a new trial in Canaan ?
We read at Genesis 12 : 11 - 13 : “ It came about that as soon as he got near to entering Egypt , then he said to Sarai his wife : ‘ Please , now ! I well know you are a woman beautiful in appearance .
Please say you are my sister , in order that it may go well with me on your account , and my soul will be certain to live due to you . ’ ”
That put Abram’s life at risk .
In this , Abram set a fine example for husbands to exercise loving headship , and Sarai , by demonstrating her subjection , is an example for wives today . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 23 - 28 ; Colossians 4 : 6 .
Furthermore , he was not under obligation to divulge information to people who were not entitled to it .
How did Sarai respond to Abram’s request ?
Sarai thus chose to ‘ subject herself to her husband ’ and conceal her married status .
In what distressing circumstance did Abram and Sarai find themselves , and how did Jehovah deliver Sarai ?
How distressing this must have been for Abram and Sarai !
* What contempt Abram must have felt for these gifts !
Why did you not tell me that she was your wife ?
Today , Jehovah does not guarantee us protection from the ravages of death , crime , famine , or natural disaster .
While individuals may be allowed to die , God will never allow the extermination of his people as a whole .
Sacrificing to Keep Peace
What indicates that Abram stayed on the move in Canaan ?
With the famine in Canaan evidently over , “ Abram went up out of Egypt , he and his wife and all that he had , and Lot with him , to the Negeb [ the semiarid area south of the mountains of Judah ] .
And Abram was heavily stocked with herds and silver and gold . ”
So the land did not allow for them to dwell all together , because their goods had become many and they were not able to dwell all together .
And a quarrel arose between the herders of Abram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock ; and at that time the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling in the land . ”
Tensions and hard feelings thus developed between the herders .
Such bickering was unbecoming to worshipers of the true God .
Near Bethel there exists what has been called “ one of the great view - points of Palestine . ”
Although the Bible describes Lot as “ righteous , ” for some reason he did not defer to Abram in this matter , nor does it seem that he sought the older man’s counsel .
Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan , but Lot dwelt among the cities of the District . Finally he pitched tent near Sodom . ”
Because “ the men of Sodom were bad and were gross sinners against Jehovah , ” says Genesis 13 : 13 .
Lot’s decision to move there would eventually cause his family much grief .
No , Abram would not be permitted to settle in the comfort of a city .
( a ) What significance may there have been to Abram’s travels ?
The Enemy Attacks
( b ) What was the reason for the invasion of the four eastern kings ?
“ Now it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , * and Tidal king of Goiim , that these made war . ”
They also took Lot the son of Abram’s brother and his goods and continued on their way . He was then dwelling in Sodom . ”
News of these devastating events soon reached Abram : “ After that a man who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew . He was then tabernacling among the big trees of Mamre the Amorite , the brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner ; and they were confederates of Abram .
And he proceeded to recover all the goods , and he recovered also Lot his brother and his goods and also the women and the people . ”
Yes , to Jehovah belonged the victory .
• How did the famine in the land of Canaan prove to be a test of faith for Abram ?

1 , 2 . ( a ) Why is endurance needed in order to serve God ?
We also find refreshment in taking on the “ yoke ” of discipleship .
Nevertheless , serving Jehovah with Christ is not always easy .
Being ordered to leave a comfortable life in Ur was just the beginning .
Besides the opposition Christians might face in their public ministry , they may also experience trialsome pressures in their personal lives .
How has Satan used frontal attacks in an attempt to break the integrity of God’s people ?
Abraham’s life certainly illustrates the “ various trials ” a Christian may face today .
The 2001 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses tells of the violence Christians in Angola had to endure at the hands of enemies .
Relying on Jehovah , our brothers in such lands have steadfastly refused to quit !
How might Christian youths be victims of persecution at school ?
Well , do not give up !
Everyday Anxieties
By letting go of resentment , we make it possible to heal both our own emotions and our relationship with our brother .
Yet , some brothers ‘ stab themselves all over with many pains ’ by putting material interests ahead of Kingdom interests .
“ By faith he resided as an alien in the land of the promise as in a foreign land , and dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the very same promise . For he was awaiting the city having real foundations , the builder and maker of which city is God . ”
9 , 10 . ( a ) How can a desire for prominence create a trial ?
( b ) How might a brother today conduct himself as “ a lesser one ” ?
Consider another aspect .
Furthermore , we are urged to do “ nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism , but with lowliness of mind . ”
Christians today should likewise be willing to conduct themselves as ‘ lesser ones ’ and not demand the limelight .
If those taking the lead in the congregation seem to be withholding certain privileges from you , do some honest self - examination to determine what refinements you can make in your personality or way of handling things .
Instead of becoming bitter over the privileges you do not have , take full advantage of the privilege you do have ​ — the privilege of helping others to come to know Jehovah .
Yes , “ humble yourselves . . . under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time . ” ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 6 .
Another trial may involve the seeming delay of the end of this wicked system of things .
As a result , some may become discouraged and lose their sense of urgency .
True , he lived long enough to see his son Isaac grow up .
The apostle Paul thus said of Abraham and other patriarchs : “ In faith all these died , although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises , but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land . ” ​ — Hebrews 11 : 13 .
( a ) How are Christians today like “ temporary residents ” ?
How was Jesus able to maintain his joy in the face of trials , and how does imitating him benefit Christians today ?
He showed not only faith but patience , shrewdness , courage , and unselfish love .
He gave the worship of Jehovah priority in his life .
It must be remembered , though , that the superlative example for us to imitate was set by Jesus Christ .
Why ?
Paul thus prayed : “ Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had . ”
With the right mental attitude , we can find joy despite obstacles that Satan may throw our way .
Imitate Abraham , and be among those who “ through faith and patience inherit the promises . ” ​ — Hebrews 6 : 12 .
Did You Note ?
• How can pride and egotism create trials ?
[ Picture on page 26 ]
Some people think that Job’s trials extended over many years , but the book of Job does not point to such protracted suffering .
Apparently , right afterward Job learned of the death of his sons and daughters , who “ were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother the firstborn . ”
Of course , it is possible that the three were in Job’s vicinity when his suffering began .
“ Seek Peace and Pursue It ”
Probably not .
It is a result of subjecting themselves to the “ Prince of Peace , ” Jesus Christ , and worshiping Jehovah , “ the God of love and of peace . ” ​ — Isaiah 9 : 6 ; 2 Corinthians 13 : 11 .
Jesus was speaking to individuals who would later have the opportunity of becoming spiritual sons of God and receiving immortal life in heaven .
With whom ?
For one thing , we avoid displaying an air of superiority .
Of course , we do not cultivate friendships that “ spoil useful habits . ”
Peaceable in the Ministry
9 , 10 .
They did not water down their message , and when confronted with opposition , they were determined to obey God as ruler rather than men .
Nevertheless , they did not confuse boldness with rudeness .
Rather , he emphasized points they agreed on , crediting Agrippa with being an expert on Jewish customs and a believer in the prophets . ​ — Acts 26 : 2 , 3 , 27 .
Paul followed his own advice and spoke the truth .
His objective was to defend his right to preach about Jesus .
How can we be peacemakers in our ministry ?
In a peaceable way .
How ?
Step back from the volatile situation .
Jehovah foretold regarding his people : “ I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners . ”
Elders can keep peace among themselves by displaying the peaceable and reasonable “ wisdom from above . ”
Not if such a situation is handled properly .
Instead of insisting on his own way , a peacemaker will prayerfully consider his brother’s viewpoint .
Experienced overseers know that preserving the peace is more important than getting one’s own way .
Loving elders strive to see the good in others .
• What does it mean to be peaceable ?
[ Picture on page 9 ]
In 1994 , I began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses , and little by little my personality changed .
Later that day , I could hardly believe my eyes when I noticed her among the baptism candidates !
Really , Bible truth does change lives .
Why should we let anything or anyone control in our hearts ?
Paul was not telling the Colossians to surrender their free will .
When we hear of an apparent injustice in the congregation , what should we first consider ?
On a far smaller scale , we may believe that someone has been treated unfairly within the Christian congregation .
We should ask ourselves , ‘ Is it really an injustice ? ’
Thereafter , rather than discuss the matter with anyone who will listen , why not commit the case to Jehovah in prayer and trust in him to see to it that justice is done ?
When We Are Beset by Anxiety
Anxiety is a very real part of life in these “ last days . ”
Lot was “ greatly distressed ” because of the depravity of Sodom .
Paul was beset by “ anxiety for all the congregations . ”
Jesus was in such agony on the night preceding his death that “ his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground . ”
Whatever causes it , however , if anxiety is intense and prolonged , it can rob us of peace .
What can we do , then , if we are afflicted by anxiety ?
What are some practical steps that may be taken to relieve anxiety , but what causes of anxiety cannot be removed ?
In some situations , we may be able to take practical measures .
* If we are weighed down by many responsibilities , it might be possible to delegate some of these to others .
What of a Christian living with an opposed mate ?
Yes , the perfect Son of God was a man of prayer .
Conquering Our Limitations
Some may be discouraged because of advancing age , growing family obligations , or deteriorating health .
What he did stress was loyalty .
What warm assurance of Jehovah’s love !
What assurance do we have that Jehovah values each one of us ?
In what way are we not alone as we strive to endure ?
The anointed Christians to whom Paul wrote were called to be part of the body of Christ , as are the remaining ones of the anointed today .
Do You Recall ?
In what sense were all things created “ for ” God’s Son , Jesus ?
Jehovah used his only - begotten Son as the master worker in creating all other things , that is , all things besides Jesus himself .
Thus , it was right that God would have his coworker , Jesus , derive pleasure from his accomplishments .
Be Grateful and Be Happy
“ THE impulse of gratitude is a fundamental human experience , ” said the Calgary Herald , a Canadian newspaper .
One youth said that he was grateful for his family ‘ because they had cared for him . ’
Ingratitude leads to chronic dissatisfaction .
I .
Packer , “ we’re built to live in dependence on God and mutual dependence on each other . ”
This reminds us of the Bible’s wise counsel made centuries ago , which says : “ Show yourselves thankful . ”
Expressions of thankfulness and heartfelt gratitude toward others help to cultivate caring relationships .
Furthermore , by appreciating and valuing one another , we also show ourselves thankful to Jehovah , and he notices this .

NEAR the end of their 40 - year trek in the wilderness , the Israelites were encamped on the Plains of Moab .
But if they did not keep listening to him , maledictions would just as surely overtake them . ​ — Deuteronomy 8 : 10 - 14 ; 26 : 18 ; 28 : 2 , 15 .
Jehovah’s people must not simply listen to him occasionally ; they must keep listening as a way of life .
The Hebrew verb translated “ overtake ” has been identified as a hunting term most often meaning “ to catch up with ” or “ to reach . ”
How can we be like Joshua , and why is this vitally important ?
Joshua said : “ Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve . . . As for me and my household , we shall serve Jehovah . ”
At that , the people replied : “ It is unthinkable , on our part , to leave Jehovah so as to serve other gods . ”
To help strengthen your resolve to do so , consider the national history of ancient Israel as well as instructive individual examples . ​ — Romans 15 : 4 .
In response to Solomon’s prayer , what did God grant him , and how should we feel about such blessings ?
But when powerful opposition arose , their zeal began to flag and construction stopped .
Sacrificing spiritual interests in the pursuit of material advantages does not result in Jehovah’s blessing . ​ — Luke 12 : 15 - 21 .
How fitting , then , the exhortation : “ Set your heart upon your ways ” !
Thus , Jehovah exhorted them to bring the tenth parts of their produce into his storehouse and to test him out to see whether he would not open to them the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out upon them a blessing until there was no more want .
In addition to presenting Israel’s national history , the Bible chronicles the lives of many individuals who received divine blessings or maledictions , depending on whether they kept listening to Jehovah or not .
Let us see what we can learn from three of them ​ — Boaz , Nabal , and Hannah .
In obedience to the Law , Boaz made sure that in his field , gleanings were left for the afflicted and poor .
What did Boaz do when he learned about Ruth and Naomi and saw Ruth’s diligence in providing for her elderly mother - in - law ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Boaz show deep regard for Jehovah’s law of repurchase ?
The most outstanding evidence that Boaz kept listening to Jehovah was the unselfish way in which he acted on God’s law of repurchase .
From the unselfish deeds of Boaz , we learn that blessings overtake those who show love for others and act in harmony with God’s requirements .
What kind of man was Nabal ?
How did Nabal treat David , and how did Abigail differ from her husband in this regard ?
When David’s messengers asked for some food , however , Nabal “ screamed rebukes at them ” and sent them away empty - handed .
Hot with anger , David had been about to exterminate Nabal and his men .
How can we imitate Boaz and repudiate the ways of Nabal ?
While we should reject the harsh and selfish ways of Nabal , let us imitate the kindness and unselfishness of Boaz .
Jehovah’s blessing also overtook the godly woman Hannah .
Hannah did not allow her trials to diminish her desire to be where God’s Word was taught and his people assembled for worship .
As Jehovah’s present - day servants , we do not worship at a tabernacle .
Keep Listening to Jehovah !
For obediently listening to Jehovah , “ a great crowd ” will be preserved through “ the great tribulation ” and will experience the joys of life in God’s new world .
As the next article will show , however , even now those who keep on listening to Jehovah’s voice are blessed with ‘ good gifts and perfect presents from above . ’ ​ — James 1 : 17 .
• What can Israel’s history teach us about divine blessings ?
• How did Boaz and Nabal differ ?
But do material things make them happy ?
It adds : “ It’s a paradox .
How true the Scriptures are in pointing out that neither happiness nor life results from the things we possess ! ​ — Ecclesiastes 5 : 10 ; Luke 12 : 15 .
The Bible teaches that the greatest happiness comes from God’s blessing .
In this regard , Proverbs 10 : 22 states : “ The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich , and he adds no pain with it . ”
Yet , some may ask , ‘ If no pain is added to Jehovah’s blessing , why do many of God’s servants suffer ? ’
Jehovah is the source of “ every good gift and every perfect present . ”
God’s Word ​ — prophecy in particular — ​ is expressed with such divine wisdom that the wicked cannot get the real sense of it , though Jehovah’s people do .
How do we obtain godly wisdom ?
To gain wisdom , we must also keep listening to Jehovah by regularly studying and applying his Word .
The orders from Jehovah are upright , causing the heart to rejoice ; the commandment of Jehovah is clean , making the eyes shine .
The fear of Jehovah is pure , standing forever . The judicial decisions of Jehovah are true ; they have proved altogether righteous .
Sooner or later , they discover that God is not one to be mocked , for a person will reap what he sows .
Millions who disregard Bible principles are reaping such tragic consequences as unwanted pregnancies , loathsome diseases , or debilitating addictions .
This hope is sure because it rests on God’s most loving gift to mankind ​ — the ransom sacrifice of his only - begotten Son , Jesus Christ .
Grateful for the Gift of Holy Spirit
Another loving gift of God for which we should be grateful is his holy spirit .
On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , the apostle Peter urged the multitude present in Jerusalem : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
For example , consider Tabitha , a fine Christian woman of the first century .
Love also motivated Epaphras , Luke , Onesiphorus , and others to help the apostle while he was imprisoned in Rome .
Yes , Christians of that sort today ‘ have love among themselves , ’ a blessed gift from God that identifies them as Jesus ’ true disciples . ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
Do you cherish the love manifested in the Christian congregation ?
How can we show that we value them ?
What is required of a Christian if he is to serve as an elder or a ministerial servant ?
When those serving as elders in the congregation exert themselves as evangelizers , shepherds , and teachers , they give us sound reasons to appreciate such “ gifts in men . ”
Consider the case of one hard - working elder who visited a Christian girl about to have brain surgery .
“ He was so kind , so supportive , so caring , ” wrote a family friend .
As he prayed , the father [ not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses ] sobbed , and tears fell from the eyes of everyone in the hospital room .
I became strong and peaceful . ”
It is a gift from God , made available through the Christian congregation . ​ — Isaiah 32 : 1 , 2 .
Nevertheless , the privilege of sharing in the public ministry is open to all ​ — young and old , male and female — ​ who have a genuine desire to serve God .
Jehovah has entrusted the Kingdom - preaching work to his humble servants , not to individuals who tend to be proud and to rely on their own abilities .
They also appreciate the spiritual assistance he provides through “ the faithful steward . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 42 - 44 ; Proverbs 22 : 4 .
What factors lead to success in raising children ?
Let each of us , then , determine what is truly important in our life .
Or are we pursuing the ‘ good gifts and perfect presents ’ that come from “ the Father of the celestial lights ” ?
Do You Recall ?
• What are some of the gifts that Jehovah gives to his people ?
• Why is the field ministry a gift ?

Do you show appreciation for God’s gift of his written Word ?

VIEWS on faith differ dramatically .
Nowadays , in a world of skepticism and suffering , true faith in God and in the Bible is disappearing rapidly .
That was what happened in the case of writer and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy .
His father’s death at sea was a serious blow to what was already a very weak faith .
When Sarah Jayne was 19 , she learned that she had ovarian cancer .
That same year the cancer returned , and she learned that she had only weeks to live .
Which is more reasonable ​ — to believe that “ this life is all we have , so we had better make the most of it , ” as Kennedy suggests , or to believe in God and his promise of a resurrection ?
“ Seek God . . . and Really Find Him ”
To develop faith and trust in someone , you need to know him and to learn how he thinks and acts .
Some feel that this is impossible .
Some have done this simply by observing the universe around them .
* They feel , as the apostle Paul did , that “ [ God’s ] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward , because they are perceived by the things made , even his eternal power and Godship . ” ​ — Romans 1 : 20 ; Psalm 104 : 24 .
To build real faith in the Creator , however , you need something else that he has provided .
Jesus Christ said that these ones were “ workers of lawlessness ” who would be clearly identified by their evil actions .
To reject God’s Word on the basis of Christendom’s record is like throwing away a letter from a trusted friend simply because the person who happens to deliver it is disreputable .
It is only through the pages of the Bible that Jehovah presents his side of things , so to speak .
She observed , for example , the Bible’s powerful influence in the lives of those who adhere to its principles .
It is not enough , however , simply to have a Bible or even to believe that it is inspired .
Even young ones can do this .
Paul says that “ from infancy ” Timothy was taught “ the holy writings ” by his mother and grandmother .
Like the first - century Beroeans , she “ received the word [ from her parents and other teachers ] with the greatest eagerness of mind . ”
Such faith , he said , is “ the assured expectation of things hoped for , the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld . ”
You will be convinced that such hopes are based on sure guarantees , not on wishful thinking .
Stay close to God’s organization .
Pray constantly .
He is a real friend to me , and I dearly love him . ”

And youths are especially vulnerable to the attacks of Satan , who like “ a roaring lion ” preys on the inexperienced .
Why is parental training and guidance essential for bringing up children successfully ?
In fact , they often resent counsel regardless of who gives it .
We need not harbor such fears .
Why may it be difficult for parents to imitate Jehovah’s love ?
He always considers what is best for his people . ​ — Isaiah 30 : 20 ; 48 : 17 .
We read : “ Just as an eagle stirs up its nest , hovers over its fledglings , spreads out its wings , takes them , carries them on its pinions , Jehovah alone kept leading [ Jacob ] . ”
He gave the people the Mosaic Law .
“ My parents immediately noticed a change in my attitude and showed concern , ” relates Lisa .
*
He also showed a willingness to hear their prayers . ​ — 2 Chronicles 17 : 7 - 9 ; Psalm 65 : 2 ; Isaiah 1 : 1 - 3 , 18 - 20 ; Jeremiah 25 : 4 ; Galatians 3 : 22 - 24 .
First and foremost , they must make time for them .
Parents also do well to avoid thoughtless comments that ridicule , such as , “ Is that all ?
For example , King David of ancient Israel sinned gravely by having an adulterous relationship with Bath - sheba .
“ Let your reasonableness become known to all men , ” wrote the apostle Paul .
One definition of the Greek word translated “ reasonable ” is “ not insisting on the letter of the law . ”
Jehovah sets an outstanding example in reasonableness .
He said : “ Here I do show you consideration to this extent also , by my not overthrowing the city of which you have spoken . ”
In an illustrative way , Isaiah compared Jehovah to a farmer and said : “ Is it all day long that the plower plows in order to sow seed , that he loosens and harrows his ground ?
Jehovah “ plows in order to sow seed ” and “ loosens and harrows his ground . ”
Then , as if to ‘ plow ’ the son’s heart , the father told a story of a little boy who suffered terrible hardship at the hands of a bully .
What lesson in parental correction is provided at Isaiah 28 : 26 - 29 ?
Still , he will not tread the harder grains to the point of crushing them .
Some children respond to just a glance from their parents , and nothing more is needed .
Coming up with a definite time that is convenient for all can be a challenge .
Yet , the family was always together on the nights of the congregation meetings .
How can parents imitate Jehovah when conducting a family study ?
“ The study was always fun , ” recalls one of his grown sons .
“ If we were out playing ball in the yard when we were called for the family study , we instantly put our ball away and ran in for the study .
What possible problem in bringing up children must yet be considered ?
Training our children takes time and effort , but doing so properly can mean everlasting life to our young ones .
What Is Your Answer ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How have some young ones reacted to Christian truth ?
“ I’M LEAVING the truth ! ”
How shocking it is for God - fearing parents who have tried hard to bring up their children in the Christian way to hear these words from a child !
Other youths just “ drift away ” without actually declaring their intentions .
Though most of Jehovah’s Witnesses do not have this problem , for those who do , no words of comfort can completely remove their grief .
And not to be overlooked is the unhappiness that the wayward youth himself can experience .
Why Some Decide to Leave
Why , then , do other young ones leave ?
Or they may consider Jehovah’s protective sheepfold too restrictive .
More than merely going through the motions of worshiping Jehovah , it is important that young ones cultivate a close personal relationship with him .
Yes , reading the Word of God regularly is essential for cultivating a close bond with Jehovah .
Moreover , make the Scriptural discussion lively .
A girl in her early teens felt torn between the Christian way of life and her association with friends who did not share her beliefs .
What did she do about it ?
“ For the very first time , ” she confessed , “ I really prayed to Jehovah about how I felt . ”
When praying as a family , parents can pour out their heart so that their children can feel the personal bond between the parents and Jehovah .
Despite their repeatedly ‘ putting him to the test , ’ Jehovah “ was merciful ” to them .
He took the initiative by sending his messengers to the Israelites “ again and again . ”
Yet , Jehovah did not compromise his righteous principles .
Can the tender part of his heart be reached ?
The apostle Paul assures us : “ The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit , and of joints and their marrow , and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart . ”
Yes , parents can do more than simply tell their offspring not to get involved in wrongdoing again .
Where possible , the parents can appeal to his heart , using all means Scripturally appropriate to convince him .
He may come back to his “ proper senses out from the snare of the Devil . ”
Of course , no one should “ make request ” concerning blatant sin that is clearly being practiced unrepentantly by any individual once associated with the Christian congregation .
Yet , parents can ask Jehovah to give them wisdom to deal with the situation .
Though the youths readily complied and enjoyed such sessions , their influence on one another eventually led them to cut their ties with the congregation .

How can we imitate the attitude of the prodigal’s father in Jesus ’ parable ?
When a youth who has left the congregation comes back to the Kingdom Hall or attends an assembly , think of how he may feel .
He began studying the Bible again and was later baptized .

But do not give up .
In fact , he has taken the initiative in making an arrangement to reconcile humans to himself .

Kingdom Proclaimers Report
In this regard , a special pioneer minister in a South American country relates the following experience .
He replied : ‘ There is no other organization on earth like yours .
Then he asked if I had ever been to the world headquarters of our organization .
Then he said that he wanted me to have that opportunity .
To the first - century Hebrew Christians , the apostle Paul wrote : “ There remains a sabbath resting for the people of God .
To the first man and his wife , God said : “ Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it , and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth . ”
Although God had given mankind and the earth a perfect start , it would take time for the whole earth to be subdued and transformed into a paradise filled with a perfect human family , as God had purposed .
Thus , on “ the seventh day , ” God rested , or desisted , from further earthly creative works in order to allow what he had already created to develop in accord with his will .
How long will that rest be ?
With that wonderful prospect in view , Paul explained how one might enter into God’s rest .
That is why Paul urged his fellow Christians to ‘ rest from their own works . ’
They needed to accept God’s provision for salvation and not try to work out their own future in their own way , as Adam and Eve had .
HOW important is it to you to know that you are loved ?
Often , no matter what is going on around it , as the little one gazes into its mother’s smiling eyes , it is at ease , at peace in the arms of a mother who loves it .
Was it not helpful to know that you could approach them with any problem or question ?
Yet , having the confidence that our heavenly Father , Jehovah , loves us is far more critical to our spiritual and emotional well - being .
If that is true in your case , take heart .
How has Jehovah reassured his people of his love for them ?
Similarly , David confidently said : “ In case my own father and my own mother did leave me , even Jehovah himself would take me up . ”
In verse 8 , Paul adds : “ God recommends his own love to us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”
Did you not feel a love for Jehovah ? ​ — Romans 5 : 10 .
Yet , do you at times feel somewhat distant from Jehovah ?
On the other hand , we can change ​ — if even temporarily .
Have I gradually turned away somewhat from the living and loving God , showing in various ways a weakening of faith ?
Have I set my mind on “ the things of the flesh , ” rather than on “ the things of the spirit ” ? ’
Our life in this system of things is subject to many changes .
Christians in a certain land may enjoy peaceful conditions for some time , and then , suddenly , violent persecution erupts .
Those words were addressed to spirit - anointed Christians .
( b ) Why do such accusations not really matter to Christians ?
Some opposers have spread slanderous lies in the media , even falsely accusing Jehovah’s Witnesses of being a dangerous cult .
Do false accusations really matter ?
Now that Christ has been raised from the dead and has been placed at the right hand of God , he actively pleads for Christians .
Some experience the pain of hunger or lack sufficient clothing .
Can death itself conquer God’s love for those who have served him loyally ?
Recount some things that can never make God stop loving his faithful servants .
( b ) How do we demonstrate that we treasure God’s loving - kindness ?
Thus I shall bless you during my lifetime ; in your name I shall raise my palms ” ?
For example , is pursuing a lucrative secular career better than having the peace of mind and happiness that result from a close relationship with God ?
Some Christians have been confronted with the choice of renouncing Jehovah or facing death .
That happened to many of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nazi concentration camps during World War II .
How those words must have helped the disciples to realize the tender feelings that their heavenly Father had for them !
It would be hard to overemphasize this fact : Jehovah has affection for you .
Let each of us continue to do our part , loyally observing God’s commands .
We should strengthen our resolve to continue drawing close to Jehovah in prayer and studying his Word .

Acquire a Heart Agreeable to Jehovah
Why should we be interested in our heart ?
Mere man sees what appears to the eyes ; but as for Jehovah , he sees what the heart is . ”
In most cases it is used in a figurative sense .
And those making contributions “ came , everyone whose heart impelled him . ”
Clearly , one aspect of the figurative heart is motivation ​ — the inner force that urges us to action .
“ Understanding , ” “ knowledge , ” and “ reasoning ” can also be associated with the heart .
What exhortation did Moses give to Israel as they were encamped on the Plains of Moab ?
The Israelites were to “ pay good heed . ”
There is only one source of that knowledge , the inspired Word of God .
How is this done ?
The psalmist David explains : “ I have remembered days of long ago ; I have meditated on all your activity ; I willingly kept myself concerned with the work of your own hands . ” ​ — Psalm 143 : 5 .
How valuable are personal study and meditation ?
Thirty - two - year - old Lisa * explains how she came to appreciate the value of purposeful study and meditation : “ After my baptism in 1994 , I was quite active in the truth for about two years .
But I woke up and decided to clean up my life .
It is urgent that we now buy out the opportune time and apply our heart to God’s Word ! ​ — Ephesians 5 : 15 , 16 .
How can our heart be likened to soil ?
How may we prepare our heart ?
How appropriate that we begin each period of personal Bible study with a sincere prayer and then maintain a prayerful attitude during our study !
Rather , let us be willing to “ let God be found true , though every man be found a liar . ” ​ — Romans 3 : 4 .
How may we prepare our heart to listen at Christian meetings ?
The spoken words can exert little influence on us if we are preoccupied with things that happened during the day or are concerned about what is awaiting us tomorrow .
How does humility help us to be more teachable ?
Humility enabled Jesus ’ “ unlettered and ordinary ” disciples to grasp and apply spiritual truths that escaped “ wise and intellectual ” men .
While we are endowed with a capacity for spirituality , pressures from this wicked world or such traits as laziness may dull our consciousness of our need .
Even if we at first do not find pleasure in Bible reading and personal study , with persistence we will find that knowledge will ‘ become pleasant to our very soul , ’ so that we eagerly look forward to study periods . ​ — Proverbs 2 : 10 , 11 .
“ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding , ” admonished King Solomon .
He is able to carry out all that he has purposed .
Of course , to cultivate trust in him , we need to “ taste and see that Jehovah is good ” by applying what we learn from the Bible in our personal life and by reflecting upon the good that this produces . ​ — Psalm 34 : 8 .
How does godly fear help us to be receptive to God’s guidance ?
Pointing to yet another quality that makes our heart receptive to divine guidance , Solomon stated : “ Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad . ”
More than all other qualities , love truly makes our heart responsive to Jehovah’s direction .
Name has been changed .
David appreciatively meditated on spiritual things .
Do you ?

A look at the stump of the fallen tree provided the answer .
What a tragedy it is when a true worshiper who appears to be firmly rooted in the Christian way of life succumbs to a test of faith .
How is your blood pressure ?
Is your heartbeat steady and strong ?
Am I moved to exert myself vigorously , sharing in some feature of the full - time ministry when possible ?
To the Israelites who were on the verge of entering the Promised Land , Moses said : “ Jehovah your God made you walk these forty years in the wilderness , in order to humble you , to put you to the test so as to know what was in your heart , as to whether you would keep his commandments or not . ”
Could this be a signal that we are taking undue interest in other people’s personal affairs ? ​ — 1 Peter 4 : 15 .
Then , in an attempt to cover up their wrongdoing , they deceived their father into thinking that Joseph had been killed by a wild animal .
If we are quick to be critical of others , could that be an evidence of envy or jealousy in our heart ?
Even the apostle Peter lyingly denied Jesus three times .
What can our prayers reveal about our heart ?
From what Solomon asked for and did not ask for , Jehovah knew what was close to Solomon’s heart .
What Do Our Actions Say ?
It has been said that actions speak louder than words .
How would you apply Luke 16 : 10 as to safeguarding your heart ?
Yes , we need to examine our conduct in seemingly small matters of everyday life , even those taking place in the privacy of our home .
14 , 15 . ( a ) What is a “ simple ” eye ?
“ The lamp of the body is the eye , ” said Jesus .
Indeed , our eye should be focused on “ seeking first the kingdom and [ God’s ] righteousness . ”
But what if we are tempted by a desire to have the latest , the best , and the most sought after in the way of food , clothing , shelter , and other things ?
Other senses , such as touching and hearing , play their part , and we need to take precautionary measures with the corresponding body members as well .
An improper desire can originate in the recesses of our mind .
How important that we keep filling our mind with spiritual concerns !
We should also make a practice of examining our heart , prayerfully reflecting on what our words and actions reveal .
Of what value is such reflection unless we earnestly seek Jehovah’s help to correct any weakness that we detect ?

( b ) What does the word “ long - suffering ” mean ?
But all benefited from the same kindly quality of Jehovah ​ — long - suffering .
What has been the purpose of Jehovah’s long - suffering , and what is its limit ?
While humans can be long - suffering , Jehovah is the supreme example of this quality .
The fact that the almighty God is at once slow to anger and great in power shows that his long - suffering is the result of purposeful restraint .
What remarkable evidence of long - suffering has Jehovah displayed toward the descendants of Adam and Eve ?
Over a century before the Flood , “ God saw the earth and , look ! it was ruined , because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth . ”
Still , for a limited time , Jehovah showed long - suffering toward mankind .
How was Jehovah’s long - suffering manifested toward the nation of Israel ?
Jehovah’s long - suffering toward Israel lasted much longer than 120 years .
During the time of the Judges , the Israelites repeatedly fell away to idolatry .
Jehovah’s Long - Suffering Not Lost
When did Jehovah’s long - suffering reach a limit ?
In 740 B.C.E . , he allowed the Assyrians to overthrow the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel and lead its inhabitants into exile .
And at the end of the following century , he permitted the Babylonians to invade the two - tribe kingdom of Judah and destroy Jerusalem with its temple . ​ — 2 Chronicles 36 : 16 - 19 .
How did Jehovah make room for long - suffering even when he was executing judgment ?
Even while executing his judgments against Israel and Judah , however , Jehovah did not forget to be long - suffering .
By means of his prophet Jeremiah , Jehovah foretold a restoration of his chosen people .
( a ) In 36 C.E . , to whom was the privilege of becoming a part of Abraham’s spiritual seed extended ?
How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are ! ” ​ — Romans 11 : 25 , 26 , 33 ; Galatians 6 : 15 , 16 .
What is the primary reason for divine long - suffering , and what issue required time for settlement ?
The moral issue raised by Satan over the way Jehovah uses His sovereignty required time to be settled satisfactorily before all creation .
( b ) How will Jehovah’s name be sanctified and his sovereignty be vindicated ?
Jehovah’s words to Pharaoh were quoted when the apostle Paul explained the role of God’s long - suffering in the glorification of His holy name .
Under their Head , Jesus Christ , these “ holy ones ” are heirs of the Kingdom that Jehovah will use to sanctify His great name and to vindicate His sovereignty . ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 ; 7 : 13 , 14 , 27 ; Revelation 4 : 9 - 11 ; 5 : 9 , 10 .
Hence , let us not be impatient with Jehovah’s way of handling matters .
In Hebrew , the word for “ nose ” or “ nostril ” ( ʼaph ) is often used figuratively for anger .
[ Picture on page 9 ]
Christians today make good use of Jehovah’s long - suffering
Recount a fine example of long - suffering .
In spite of this constant opposition , Régis continued to be long - suffering .
Long - suffering was not viewed as a virtue by the Greeks of the first century .
The word itself was never used by the Stoic philosophers .
The Greeks may have considered long - suffering to be a sign of weakness , but here , as in other cases , “ a foolish thing of God is wiser than men , and a weak thing of God is stronger than men . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 1 : 25 .
Christ’s Example of Long - Suffering
Second only to Jehovah , Christ Jesus set a fine example of long - suffering .
What remarkable long - suffering Jesus showed throughout his ministry on earth !
He endured the treacherous questions of his enemies and the insults of opposers .
A Fruit of the Spirit
Therefore , when God’s servants manifest godly patience , or long - suffering , they do so under the influence of the holy spirit .
We must willingly yield to its influence .
Do not be misled : God is not one to be mocked .
“ Love Is Long - Suffering ”
Barnes points out : “ The word here used [ for long - suffering ] is opposed to haste : to passionate expressions and thoughts , and to irritability .
Love and long - suffering still contribute greatly to the peace of the Christian congregation .
Help me .
I want a Bible study . ”
Régis says : “ This proved that Jehovah blessed those years of struggle , patience , and endurance . ”
Back in the first century C.E . , the apostle Paul was a fine example of long - suffering .
In order to endure , we all need faith , love , and long - suffering .
Clothed With Long - Suffering
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you , so do you also . But , besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 12 - 14 .
When members of a congregation ‘ clothe themselves ’ with compassion , kindness , lowliness of mind , mildness , long - suffering , and love , they are able to resolve problems and go forward unitedly in Jehovah’s service .
There may be times when they need to reprove another Christian , but there are different ways of doing this .
Yes , Jehovah’s sheep should always be treated with long - suffering , dignity , and tenderness . ​ — Matthew 7 : 12 ; 11 : 28 ; Acts 20 : 28 , 29 ; Romans 12 : 10 .
What was Paul’s prayer for the Colossians ?
Jehovah’s continued long - suffering , or patience , will not be a test to us if we are “ filled with the accurate knowledge of his will , ” which is that “ all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Cultivating the fruitage of the spirit ​ — love , kindness , goodness , mildness , and self - control — ​ will enable us to be joyfully long - suffering .
On the one hand , God’s loving forbearance is demonstrated by his holding back his wrath toward human rebellion ; on the other hand , his kindness is found in the thousandfold expressions of his mercy .
Thus Paul’s description of love begins with this twofold description of God , who through Christ has shown himself forbearing and kind toward those who deserve divine judgment . ”
Can You Explain ?
• In what ways is Christ a wonderful example of long - suffering ?
• How does long - suffering help families , Christian communities , and elders ?
Christian overseers are urged to set a good example of long - suffering in dealing with their brothers
Why is it appropriate to ask Jehovah to show us how “ to count our days ” ?
No one else could therefore be in a better position to show us how to use our years of life in a wise way .
First , though , let us get a brief overview of this divinely inspired song .
( a ) Who is named as the composer of Psalm 90 , and when may it have been written ?
The superscription of Psalm 90 calls it “ a prayer of Moses , the man of the true God . ”
Before the mountains themselves were born , or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land , even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God [ or , the Divine One ] . ” ​ — Psalm 90 : 1 , 2 , footnote .
And by saying that the mountains were “ born ” and the earth was brought forth as with “ labor pains , ” the psalmist is showing great respect for the amount of work involved when Jehovah created these things .
“ Even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God , ” sang the psalmist .
That is , man returns “ to dust , ” as crushed , or pulverized , earth .
Moses saw thousands of Israelites die in the wilderness , ‘ swept away ’ by God as in a flood .
Yes , our life is as transitory as grass that withers in a single day .
Therefore , let us not waste this precious commodity .
Psalm 90 : 7 - 9 had what fulfillment upon the Israelites ?
You have set our errors right in front of you , our hidden things before your bright face .
He called them to account for their public wrongdoing , but even their “ hidden things , ” or concealed sins , were ‘ before his bright face . ’
How much better that would be than possibly ‘ finishing our years just like a whisper , ’ with our hope of everlasting life in jeopardy !
What life span is typical of people in general , and our years are filled with what ?
But of the faithless generation that came out of Egypt , registered ones from 20 years old and upward died within 40 years .
18 , 19 . ( a ) What does it mean to “ count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in ” ?
Regardless of our age , though , ‘ we do not know what our life will be tomorrow , for we are a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing . ’
( b ) How will Jehovah deal with us if we err seriously but demonstrate true repentance ?
In this regard , Moses pleads : “ Do return , O Jehovah ! How long will it be ?
So even if we were to err seriously but demonstrate true repentance , Jehovah would ‘ satisfy us with his loving - kindness , ’ and we would have reason to “ cry out joyfully . ”
Meditating on the 90th Psalm ought to increase our dependence on Jehovah , our “ real dwelling . ”
If we are to keep everlasting life in view , however , Jehovah must be our refuge .
Why ?
Because Jehovah grants us “ power beyond what is normal . ”
In any case , the 91st Psalm promises spiritual security to anointed Christians as a class and provides similar assurance for their dedicated companions as a group .
( b ) What do we experience by “ lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One ” ?
5 , 6 .
What “ pestilence ” has caused “ adversities , ” but why do Jehovah’s people not succumb to it ?
But Jehovah has never let his faithful people succumb to such a “ pestilence . ”
God protects us , even as a parent bird hovers protectively over its young .
With them a bird covers its young , protecting them from predators .
Like our faith , God’s trueness is a large protective shield that stops Satan’s burning missiles and wards off enemy blows .
Why can the night be a fear - inspiring time , but why are we not fearful ?
Since many evil deeds are committed under the cloak of darkness , the night can be a fear - inspiring time .
“ The destruction that despoils at midday ” does not frighten us either .
Only with your eyes will you look on and see the retribution itself of the wicked ones . ”
Because of failing to make Jehovah their refuge , many “ fall ” in spiritual death at our “ very side . ”
Even when we share with others in such calamities as earthquakes , hurricanes , floods , famines , and ravages of warfare , these do not destroy our faith or our spiritual security .
Anointed Christians are like alien residents living in tents apart from this system of things .
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly , we are no part of the world , and we are not infected by such spiritually deadly plagues as its immorality , materialism , false religion , and worship of “ the wild beast ” and its “ image , ” the United Nations . ​ — Revelation 9 : 20 , 21 ; 13 : 1 - 18 ; John 17 : 16 .
Who will ‘ see salvation by Jehovah ’ ?
Writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures did not discuss Psalm 91 from the standpoint of Messianic prophecy .
Jehovah helps his servants to perform their ministry despite unexpected attacks and open opposition
THOSE words were spoken nearly two thousand years ago by Jesus Christ in his famous Sermon on the Mount .
Among other things , it has been extolled as “ the very essence of Scripture , ” “ a summary of the Christian’s duty to his neighbour , ” and “ a fundamental ethical principle . ”
In The Analects , the third of the Confucian Four Books , we find the thought expressed three times .
The obvious difference is that the Golden Rule stated by Jesus requires positive actions of doing good to others .
Would I like to live in a world without racial prejudice , crime , and war ?
Golden Rule Tarnished
These include the slave trade out of Africa , Nazi death camps , forced child labor , and brutal genocides in one place or another .
The horrifying list could be much longer .
Sadly , this is the case even among many who claim to believe in God .
And judging by the way things are going , people will only become more self - centered .
Their God - given conscience , when properly trained , would guide them to treat others the way they themselves would want to be treated .
Their selfish and rebellious action resulted not only in great loss to themselves but also in tragic consequences for all their future offspring .
That was a clear demonstration of the dire result of ignoring the teaching that came to be known as the Golden Rule .
Consequently , “ through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12 .
Though mankind as a whole turned their back on the loving ways of Jehovah God , he did not abandon them .
The Law gave direction on treatment of slaves , fatherless boys , and widows .
The Law commanded : “ You must not oppress an alien resident , as you yourselves have known the soul of the alien resident , because you became alien residents in the land of Egypt . ”
And Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security , everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree . ” ​ — 1 Kings 4 : 20 , 25 .
Though having God’s Law , the Israelites did not observe it ; they allowed selfishness to choke out their concern for others .
What a price to pay for abandoning Jehovah’s pure worship !
An Example to Imitate
He genuinely cared for the welfare of others .
The Bible account says : “ When the Lord caught sight of her , he was moved with pity for her . ”
Finally , in harmony with God’s purpose , Jesus willingly suffered and gave his life as a ransom so that mankind could be freed from slavery under sin and death .
This was the ultimate example of living by the Golden Rule . ​ — Matthew 20 : 28 ; John 15 : 13 ; Hebrews 4 : 15 .
Yes , and not just when it is convenient .
As you read this article , you are benefiting from another example of the Golden Rule at work .
Jehovah’s Witnesses realize that today many people suffer hopelessly and helplessly .
As prophesied at Isaiah 2 : 2 - 4 , “ many peoples , ” in fact over six million individuals around the world , have been ‘ instructed in Jehovah’s ways and walk in his paths . ’
What About You ?
Jehovah purposes to reverse the situation soon .
[ Pictures on page 7 ]
asked Caroline .
You’ve dialed the wrong number . ”
Noting the warmth in her voice , Caroline said : “ Well , let me explain what I wanted to tell Mrs . B — . ”
You were so happy to hear these things ​ — even excited — ​ and wanted to learn more .
What do you really know about Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
You’d better come .
The visit to deliver the brochure went well , and Mrs . G — ( Betty ) agreed to another call .
Caroline immediately reminded Betty of a main point from their last discussion about God’s Kingdom .
“ Who will be the King ? ”
“ Why , Jesus , ” answered Betty .
Caroline comforted her by showing her scriptures describing death as a deep sleep from which one could rise in the resurrection .
This meant much to Betty , who now enjoys a regular Bible study .
FEAR has haunted mankind for centuries .
To answer these questions , we must first understand what the fear of God means and how this type of fear forms a fundamental part of our relationship with Jehovah .
Furthermore , like King David , we perceive our own insignificance in comparison with Jehovah’s awesome creation .
Though loving and merciful , Jehovah does not tolerate unrighteousness and willful wrongdoing .
Note how the Israelites reacted after Jehovah led them out of Egypt : “ Israel also got to see the great hand that Jehovah put in action against the Egyptians ; and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah . ”
Wholesome fear of God not only fosters trust and confidence in him but also motivates us to walk in his ways .
Earlier , Moses urged the Israelites : “ After Jehovah your God you should walk , and him you should fear , and his commandments you should keep , and to his voice you should listen , and him you should serve , and to him you should cling . ”
To Love God Is to Fear Him
Thus , fear of God and love of God are closely connected .
Fear of God moves us to walk in his ways , and this in turn gives proof of our love for him .
On the other hand , since “ Jehovah is finding pleasure in those fearing him , ” our obedience and faithfulness make his heart rejoice .
Love of God moves us to please him , and fear of God holds us back from hurting him .
Jesus teaches us to fear Jehovah by helping us to understand the wonderful personality of our heavenly Father .
How can we follow the counsel given to the kings of Israel ?
Bible reading and study are just as vital for us if we would learn to fear Jehovah .
As we apply Bible principles in our life , we gradually acquire divine wisdom and knowledge .
We come to “ understand the fear of Jehovah ” because we see the good results it produces in our life , and we treasure our relationship with God .
From the foregoing , we can see that fear of God is a wholesome attitude that all of us should cultivate , since it is a fundamental part of our worship of Jehovah .
Why does Jehovah encourage us to fear him ?
“ Happy is everyone fearing Jehovah , who is walking in his ways , ” the Bible assures us .
In what ways ?
David knew from personal experience that “ the desire of those fearing him he will perform , and their cry for help he will hear , and he will save them . ”

* Wise parents try to instill a wholesome fear in their offspring , warning them again and again of surrounding dangers .
Parents know that this fear may well save their children’s life .
Jehovah has a similar concern for our well - being .
As a loving Father , he teaches us through his Word and his organization to benefit ourselves .
* It impels us to turn aside from bad , just as we would back away from the edge of a cliff when our instinctive fear sounds the alarm .
The Bible assures us that we will reap what we sow ​ — whether we sow according to the flesh or according to the spirit .
Without divine protection , the small , vulnerable nation of Israel would be at the mercy of cruel and powerful neighbors .
What are some Scriptural examples that we can consider in learning godly fear ?
( See footnote . )
How sad it would be if we waited until we had a personal tragedy before taking God’s advice to heart !
Another powerful reason for cultivating godly fear is our desire to safeguard our relationship with God .
Whom does God consider to be a friend , someone he would invite into his figurative tent ?
If we value this privileged relationship with our Creator , we will take care to walk faultlessly in his eyes .
Malachi told them that Jehovah hated “ a divorcing ” and that their treacherous spirit had alienated them from their God .
In marriage as well as in other areas of our life , hatred for all that is bad in Jehovah’s eyes , along with a deep appreciation for his friendship , will bring Jehovah’s favor and approval .
Abraham’s godly fear was put to the test when God asked him to offer as a sacrifice his only son , Isaac , through whom God would fulfill his promise that Abraham’s offspring would become a great nation .
His willingness to sacrifice Isaac was far more than a show of respectful obedience .
As Paul wrote , Abraham was “ fully convinced that what [ God ] had promised he was also able to do . ”
That is true fear of God . ​ — Psalm 115 : 11 .
Why could Joseph rightly describe himself as a man who ‘ feared the true God ’ ?
Why had Job’s conduct gladdened Jehovah’s heart ?

For many years , Job’s blameless conduct had gladdened the heart of his heavenly Father .
( a ) In what ways did Job exercise loving - kindness ?
( b ) How did Job show that he did not withhold forgiveness ?
Thus , Job took a kindly interest in the blind , the lame , and the poor .
Withholding loving - kindness could include withholding forgiveness or harboring a grudge .
A sincere prayer in behalf of the one who has offended us can do much to help us overcome resentment .
Furthermore , we fear God because we recognize his awesome power , in comparison with which the might of all the nations is insignificant .
Meanwhile , may all of us take to heart the inspired counsel of Solomon : “ Let your heart not be envious of sinners , but be in the fear of Jehovah all day long .
• How did some Israelites in Malachi’s day take Jehovah’s friendship for granted ?
• Which fear will never be done away with , and why ?
Wise parents instill a wholesome fear in their offspring
[ Picture on page 23 ]
Job maintained his fear of God even when confronted with three false friends
“ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , and I will refresh you . ” ​ — MATTHEW 11 : 28 .
That comes from following the advice and example of a young man who lived 20 centuries ago .
He was a carpenter , yet his greater love was for people .
He spoke to people’s hearts , addressed their needs , helping the weak and consoling the depressed .
Even more , he assisted many to reach their spiritual potential .
Those who learn and apply what Jesus taught enjoy immediate benefits , including relief from excess stress .
You may have doubts .
For my yoke is kindly and my load is light . ”
Let us examine these words in some detail and see how they open the way to relief from oppressive stress .
Jesus said : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father also . ” ​ — John 14 : 9 .
Or other responsibilities may seem overwhelming .
If so , you are like the sincere ones Jesus met and helped .
It can be challenging to compare ancient wages with those of modern times .
If you are employed , you may feel pressured to produce more .
Clearly , Jesus ’ invitation to all who were “ toiling and loaded down ” would have been most appealing to many listeners back then .
And recall that Jesus added the promise , “ I will refresh you . ”
That same promise is in effect today .
Raising children is a major challenge .
9 , 10 .
As a carpenter , Jesus may have made yokes , and he would have known how to shape one that was “ kindly . ”
When Jesus said , “ Take my yoke upon you , ” he could have been likening himself to one who provided well - made yokes that would be “ kindly ” to a workman’s neck and shoulders .
This signified that the yoke bar was not unpleasant to use , and the work was not slavish either .
Still , the change of viewpoint he presented would bring considerable refreshment .
Please note , Jesus was not saying that people would trade one yoke for another .
12 , 13 .
A key application of Jesus ’ illustration of the yoke became apparent regarding the disciple - making work .
Remember his call to Peter , Andrew , James , and John : “ Come after me , and I shall cause you to become fishers of men . ”
Some of his Jewish hearers got the point and applied it .
Four fishermen had toiled all night but had caught nothing .
What was their response ?
All find it refreshing , so their life becomes less stressful .
It is usually called the Sermon on the Mount .
Why not read those chapters carefully , thoughtfully ?
Apparently , the man was not ready to go that far .
The response could have increased his prospect of happiness and lasting life .
If you feel that you are already doing so , ponder to see what more you can do to live by that divine teaching .
If you have to struggle to understand it or to see how you can apply it , spend another day on it .
The next day , you can consider another teaching .
After a month or so , you may have covered all 31 points .
Do not forget that there are many other fine points of Jesus ’ teachings that are not on the list .
Why not search for some of them and try putting them into practice ? ​ — Philippians 3 : 16 .
• How can spiritual refreshment be yours ?
[ Blurb on page 14 ]
What good things can you find in Matthew chapters 5 through 7 ?
6 : 14 , 15 If I sometimes tend to be unforgiving , might envy or resentment be the basic cause ?
6 : 16 - 18 Am I inclined to be more concerned with appearances than with who I am on the inside ?
7 : 12 Though I know the Golden Rule , how often do I apply this counsel in dealing with others ?
Additional teachings that I can consider :
12 : 19 Learning from the prophecy about Jesus , do I strive to avoid contentious arguments ?
12 : 34 - 37 What do I talk about much of the time ?
19 : 13 - 15 What do I need to take time to do ?
4 : 24 , 25 What is the significance of how I treat others ?
8 : 11 , 14 If I let worry , wealth , and pleasure reign in my life , what can be the result ?
12 : 15 What is the relationship between life and possessions ?
That involves adopting his viewpoint and applying some basic principles . ​ — Matthew 10 : 24 , 25 ; Luke 14 : 26 , 27 ; John 8 : 31 , 32 ; 13 : 35 ; 15 : 8 .
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a disciple of Jesus ?
The Gospel writers also referred to “ the disciples of John [ the Baptizer ] and the disciples of the Pharisees . ”
They ought to discern that we have become more mild - tempered and lowly in heart .
Let us also note the way the religious leaders , particularly the Pharisees , dealt with people with similar problems .
However , this woman’s behavior was unusual .
Imagine yourself living back at that time and being in Jesus ’ place .
Would you have been appalled , horrified ?
If you had been among the other guests , might your thinking have been at least somewhat like that of Simon the Pharisee ?
Do you think that she probably returned to her sad way of life ?
While we cannot say for sure , take note of what Luke next says .
What can we learn from this vivid account ?
It stirs our emotions , does it not ?
The first - century Jewish historian Josephus makes it obvious that the Pharisees considered themselves to be kind , gentle , just , and altogether right for their task .
The Christian apostle Paul wrote about certain Jews , such as the Pharisees : “ They have a zeal for God ; but not according to accurate knowledge . ”
What did Jesus have to say about the Pharisees ?
Jesus went on to call the scribes and Pharisees “ fools . ”
The Pharisees looked for every flaw ​ — real or imagined .
Surely , if our actions are to be in harmony with Jesus ’ example , we must avoid the tendency of always looking for and highlighting the flaws in others .
Mark’s account says that the woman was “ frightened and trembling . ”
And further suppose that Leviticus 15 : 25 - 28 were a Christian requirement today and that a Christian woman had violated that law , feeling frantic and abandoned .
How would you react ?
But the challenge is to do it , to imitate Jesus ’ pattern .
The Law gave them room to live and breathe .
They were freer , happier , and more confident about their relationship with God and with one another .
From him they learned that being a spiritual leader calls for being refreshing to others , manifesting lowliness of mind and heart . ​ — 1 Corinthians 16 : 17 , 18 ; Philippians 2 : 3 .
He told his disciples : “ Just as the Father has loved me and I have loved you , remain in my love .
If you observe my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love . ”
Do you agree that Jesus always thought , taught , and acted appropriately ?
[ Footnote ]
For the Pharisees , God is primarily one who makes demands ; for Jesus he is gracious and compassionate .
Jesus ’ elevation of the double command of love to the level of a norm of interpretation and his rejection of the binding nature of the oral tradition . . . led him into conflict with Pharisaic casuistry . ” ​ — The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology .
[ Pictures on page 18 , 19 ]
How different Jesus ’ attitude toward people was from that of the Pharisees !
It is necessary to establish limits .
It is the parents who have to do this .
God - fearing parents recognize that their children are “ an inheritance from Jehovah . ”
For example , Proverbs 13 : 24 says : “ The one holding back his rod is hating his son , but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline . ”
Her doing so will require wisdom and tact .
Granted , he was dealing with obligations to governments , to which Christians were later told to be in submission .
Still , in many situations a true worshiper can accommodate the requests or demands of an unbeliever in authority while not sharing in a violation of God’s elevated laws .
At other times , her husband may ask her to cook a certain food , whether because it is his favorite or because he is used to having that meal in a particular season .
She will desire to show love for him and recognition of his headship .
Could she do so even if it was the day of a holiday ?
Or would she normally be willing to purchase things at his request , without judging what he intends to do with the items she buys for him while doing her shopping ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses think so .
True , many Witnesses have suffered persecution for their determination to tell the good news .
What is one reason for the zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
Why are Jehovah’s Witnesses , like those early Christians , so zealous ?
First , because the good news they publish is from Jehovah God himself .
Could there be a better reason for zeal ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses are zealous for a third reason .
They follow the example of Jesus Christ .
Thus , he became an evangelizer , a teller of good news .
And because he knew that many would respond to that good news , he said to his disciples : “ The harvest is great , but the workers are few .
Rather , Jesus set the standard for all Christian evangelizers when he told his followers : “ As you go , preach . ” — Matthew 10 : 5 - 7 .
When they returned to report the success of their evangelizing tour , Jesus was overjoyed .
He prayed : “ I publicly praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones , and have revealed them to babes . ”
After Jesus ’ ascension to heaven , to whom did his followers first preach the good news ?
To whom did they preach first ?
Israel needed to hear the good news as much as any other nation .
Some say it is and may even consider such evangelizing to be “ sheep stealing . ”
Although they already had a priesthood , Jesus did not hesitate to tell them the good news .
All Early Christians Evangelized
Regarding events on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , the Bible says : “ They all [ men and women ] became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues , just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance . ”
This proved to be true throughout those early years .
Jesus prophesied : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations ; and then the end will come . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses today follow that pattern .
Their work has been truly beneficial , since they have not become involved in politics or in other ways strayed from the commission to preach the good news .
They are announcing the best of good news for humanity .
A document published by the World Council of Churches even speaks of “ the sin of proselytism . ”
What are some examples of harmful proselytism ?
Historians tell us that in the eighth century C.E . , Charlemagne conquered the pagan Saxons of northern Europe and brutally forced them to convert .
Pressuring people to change their religion is wrong .
Throughout modern times , Jehovah’s Witnesses have preached the good news of the Kingdom in a greater fulfillment of Matthew 24 : 14 .
In the year 2001 , over 122 years later , the circulation had reached 23,042,000 copies in 141 languages .
And responsive ones are greatly benefited .
It was noted that when Jehovah’s Witnesses preach to others , they do so in such a way that a person can simply say “ I am not interested ” and close the door .
• How has the evangelizing work of Jehovah’s Witnesses grown in modern times ?
[ Picture on page 9 ]
Jesus was a zealous evangelizer and trained others to do the same work
( b ) What blessings did the good news announced by Jesus bring ?
According to the record , “ the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed him , and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written : ‘ Jehovah’s spirit is upon me , because he anointed me to declare good news . ’ ”
Light , life , freedom — surely these are blessings to be treasured !
They were liberated from religious enslavement and became part of the new spiritual nation , “ the Israel of God , ” whose members have the prospect of ruling forever in heaven with their Lord , Jesus Christ .
Evangelism Today
In what way is the commission to preach the good news being fulfilled today ?
Paul said : “ With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness , but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation . ”
They also warn that soon will come “ the day of vengeance on the part of our God ” when Jehovah will bring an end to unrepentant wrongdoers . — Psalm 37 : 9 - 11 .
In a world beset by tragedy and disaster , this is the only good news with eternal benefits .
When events took an ethnic turn , a Witness family was criticized for sheltering fellow Witnesses of a different ethnic group .
A non - Witness relative commented : “ Members of all religions betrayed their fellow worshipers .
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses did not . ”
Many similar incidents reported from lands torn apart by civil conflict show that Jehovah’s Witnesses truly “ have love for the whole association of brothers . ” — 1 Peter 2 : 17 .
Consider the example of Franco .
His wife studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses , and their Christian example gradually helped Franco to see that he had to change .
He was one of the 492 baptized in Belgium during the 2001 service year .
Isaiah prophesied that the good news would be preached to the meek ones .
Notice , too , Paul’s encouragement to his fellow evangelizer Timothy : “ Preach the word , be at it urgently . ”
The Witness told her that God is very much interested in us all , and she read Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 .
They offered to show him words of comfort from the Scriptures in view of the recent tragedy at the World Trade Center .
What experience demonstrates that some recognize the high standards of Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
He said that he was once assigned to investigate various religious organizations .
There were 263,431 who symbolized their dedication to God by getting baptized .
And the fact that 15,374,986 attended the annual Memorial of Jesus ’ death indicates that there is much more work to do .
[ Chart on page 19 - 22 ]
Jehovah’s Witnesses always remember their responsibility to evangelize
[ Pictures on page 17 ]
Those who respond to the good news become part of a united , worldwide brotherhood
Responsible men are needed to help these newly baptized ones to progress to Christian maturity . — Hebrews 6 : 1 .
Jesus Christ was certainly ‘ fit , qualified , and proficient ’ in his work — and no wonder !
From the dawn of creation , a warm bond existed between Jehovah and his Son .
There was no doubt in Jesus ’ mind that Jehovah was “ specially fond ” of him .
These words confirm what is stated at Proverbs 8 : 30 , namely , that Jesus “ came to be beside ” Jehovah while the universe was being created .
Newly appointed ministerial servants are not the only ones who need progressive training , however .
The elders should offer specific counsel to such men so that they will know how to direct their efforts .
For example , a ministerial servant may be reliable , punctual , and conscientious in caring for his duties .
Elders need to display “ a mildness that belongs to wisdom . ”
If the elder carefully ‘ seasons his counsel with salt , ’ his comments will likely be well received .
Of course , there is much a ministerial servant can do to further his own spiritual progress . — See box below entitled “ What Ministerial Servants Can Do . ”
The experience Jesus gained when on earth enabled him to develop qualities that he would need for carrying out future assignments .
While there may seem to be enough elders and ministerial servants to care for present needs , will that be the case if a new congregation is formed ?
What a large number of elders and ministerial servants are needed to care for those new congregations !
Following Jehovah’s example in his training of Jesus will result in rich blessings to many .
No doubt Timothy learned a great deal from Silas .
There was a warm bond between them .
When writing to the congregation at Corinth , Paul referred to Timothy , whom he planned to send there , as his “ beloved and faithful child in the Lord . ”
— The ministerial servant may also ask an elder to observe how he delivers a Bible talk and to offer counsel for improvement .
“ O how great his goodness is ! ”
But the little we do know moves us to praise God for his goodness .
It is moral excellence , or virtue .
In this system of things , what is considered good in some circles may be viewed as bad in others .
Who can rightly establish this standard ?
Happily , though , Jehovah helps us to display a measure of goodness .
Jehovah’s Goodness Is Extolled
After King David had the ark of the covenant brought to Jerusalem , Levites sang a song containing what expression ?
What happened after the Ark was brought into the Most Holy and following Solomon’s prayer of dedication ?
And so it proved to be .
The temple’s foundation was laid in the second year of their return .
That psalm begins and ends with the words : “ Give thanks to Jehovah , you people , for he is good ; for his loving - kindness is to time indefinite . ”
These may well have been the last words of praise that Jesus Christ sang with his faithful apostles on the night before his death in 33 C.E . — Matthew 26 : 30 .
At that time , Moses got a glimpse of God’s glory and heard this declaration : “ Jehovah , Jehovah , a God merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abundant in loving - kindness and truth , preserving loving - kindness for thousands , pardoning error and transgression and sin , but by no means will he give exemption from punishment , bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons , upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation . ”
How fitting , since Jehovah’s dominant quality is love !
One manifestation of Jehovah’s goodness is that he is “ abundant in loving - kindness . ”
( a ) The declaration heard by Moses on Mount Sinai opened with what expression ?
Mercy therefore involves feelings of tender compassion that are deep inside a person .
But mercy includes more than genuine pity .
By means of angels , for instance , God graciously strengthened the aged prophet Daniel and informed the virgin girl Mary of the privilege she was to have of giving birth to Jesus .
God’s patience also benefits those who have not yet become his worshipers .
Since God is abundant in truth , we can always trust in his promises .
What outstanding reasons to praise Jehovah for displaying goodness toward mankind ! — 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
This is actually another reason to laud Jehovah for his goodness .
Moreover , “ at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels , ” vengeance will be brought “ upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news . ”
They “ will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction . ”
What will we consider in the next article ?
A faithful remnant returned to Jerusalem
Keep On Displaying Goodness
“ The fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth . ” — EPHESIANS 5 : 9 .
THE greatest good that any human can do is to bring glory to Jehovah .
As loyal Witnesses of Jehovah , we wholeheartedly agree with the psalmist who sang : “ How abundant your goodness is , which you have treasured up for those fearing you ! ” — Psalm 31 : 19 .
It also moves us to ‘ laud Jehovah , bless him , and make known the glory of his kingship . ’
That is why we share zealously in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work .
‘ The name of God is being blasphemed on account of you people among the nations ’ ; just as it is written . ” — Romans 2 : 21 , 22 , 24 .
This has a positive effect on those outside the Christian congregation .
More important , our good conduct draws people to Jehovah’s organization , opening the way for them to bring him glory and to gain everlasting life . — Acts 13 : 48 .
Instead of involving ourselves in such works , we “ go on walking as children of light . ”
So it is by walking in the light that we are able to keep on displaying goodness .
What must we do to continue displaying the fruit of goodness ?
How can we act in harmony with Jesus ’ words recorded at Luke 11 : 9 - 13 ?
Let us follow Jesus ’ counsel by praying for Jehovah’s spirit so that we can keep on displaying its fruit of goodness .
The preceding article considered aspects of God’s goodness cited in the declaration to Moses recorded at Exodus 34 : 6 , 7 , where we read : “ Jehovah , Jehovah , a God merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abundant in loving - kindness and truth , preserving loving - kindness for thousands , pardoning error and transgression and sin , but by no means will he give exemption from punishment . ”
How should we act to reflect that Jehovah is ‘ abundant in truth ’ ?
Among seven things detestable to Jehovah are “ a false tongue ” and “ a false witness that launches forth lies . ”
15 , 16 .
If we are to continue practicing goodness , we must keep strict watch that we walk as those exercising godly wisdom .
What about our fellow believers who are unable to attend Christian meetings regularly because of a serious chronic illness ?
Relate experiences that show the effect of displaying goodness .
On his way to school one morning , he checked the amount of his small savings .
A bank security guard and others urged him to withdraw the money and deposit it for himself in another bank .
It was discovered that he had an account number that was similar to that of a rich businessman who had mistakenly deposited funds in the wrong account .
What is one especially significant way to “ keep doing good ” ?
When we are faced with decisions , then , the desire to do what is good may well cause us to ask ourselves : ‘ How will this decision affect my Kingdom - preaching activity ?
Is the course I am considering really good ?
Will it help me to assist others to accept the “ everlasting good news ” and come into a close relationship with Jehovah God ? ’
Let us never underestimate the beneficial effects of goodness .
We can keep on displaying this quality by supporting the Christian congregation and doing what we can to look after its interests and welfare .
Indeed , “ as long as we have time favorable for it , may we work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith . ” — Galatians 6 : 10 .
[ Picture on page 17 ]
Displaying goodness brings fine results
CLEANLINESS means different things to different people .
For instance , when a little boy is told by his mother to wash his hands and face , he may think that holding his fingers under a running faucet and wetting his lips is enough .
But Mother knows better .
Of course , standards of cleanliness are not the same around the world , and people grow up with varying concepts of cleanliness .
The problem is that some teachers do use cleaning as a means of punishment .
The importance of cleanliness cannot be overemphasized when it comes to our food — whether we buy it at a market , eat it at a restaurant , or have a meal at a friend’s home .
Consequently , maintaining a clean environment is no longer a matter of personal importance .
It is also a state of mind and heart that involves our morals and worship .
Clever advertisements led customers to believe that using certain personal hygiene products would give the user social status that others could only envy .
There is no doubt that those early efforts to teach cleanliness did help improve people’s living conditions .
He teaches us to benefit ourselves by becoming holy and clean in all our ways . — Isaiah 48 : 17 ; 1 Peter 1 : 15 .
Jehovah God is exemplary in this respect .
This could be considered the most important cleanness of all because it has to do with a person’s prospects for everlasting life .
Simply put , to be spiritually clean means never to cross the line that God has drawn between true worship and false , for God views any type of false worship as unclean .
Moral .
The secret recesses of one’s mind should not be a repository of unclean thoughts .
Physical .
Even where water for washing or bathing is in short supply , Christians should try to do the best they can to keep clean and presentable .
The shepherd described in The Song of Solomon appreciated the sweet fragrance of the Shulammite girl’s clothing .
Perfumes and colognes may be pleasant , but they are no substitute for regular bathing and clean clothes .
On the one hand , being fanatic about cleanliness can rob us of the joy of living .
Between these extremes is the practical , sensible approach to keeping our home clean and presentable .
Many accidents in the home are due to untidy habits .
Yes , cultivating good habits of cleanliness now gives strong evidence of our faith in God’s promise that he will soon establish a clean paradise earth .
The earth is a self - cleaning marvel
Kingdom Proclaimers Report
Similarly , in the 20th century , thousands of Witnesses died at the hands of Hitler’s henchmen for maintaining their neutrality in political and nationalistic issues .
This is what took place in Sweden recently .
By the end of 1999 , the exhibition had appeared in over 100 museums and public libraries throughout Sweden , and some 150,000 people had seen it .
Many visitors asked : “ Why haven’t you told us about your Holocaust experiences before ? ”
After the exhibition had been shown in their area , one congregation reported a 30 - percent increase in home Bible studies !
One Witness invited a fellow worker to see the exhibit .
JEHOVAH loves his human creation .
* Using unfermented bread and red wine as emblems , or symbols , of his physical body and blood , Jesus had the 11 remaining apostles share together in this communion meal .
In fact , various forms of the word “ love ” occur there 31 times .
If you observe my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love . ”
Jesus performed this humble task and then said to his disciples : “ If I , although Lord and Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to wash the feet of one another .
For I set the pattern for you , that , just as I did to you , you should do also . ”
Follow the New Commandment
6 , 7 . ( a ) What important detail does John supply concerning the institution of the Memorial ?
( b ) What new commandment did Jesus give his disciples , and what was new about it ?
He then spoke at length with his faithful apostles , giving them parting counsel and instructions .
Christians were to love one another as Christ loved them , being willing to sacrifice their very lives for their brothers .
Such self - sacrificing love could mean , and sometimes has meant , that a Christian would risk his life rather than betray his brothers .
The apostle Paul was a fine example in this regard .
Nothing could be more precious to us than to be loved by Jehovah and his Son , Christ Jesus .
What precious relationships are open to the anointed and to the “ other sheep ” ?
If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also ; if they have observed my word , they will observe yours also . ” — John 15 : 18 - 20 .
As the time to observe the Memorial approaches , all would do well to reflect on the life course of faithful ones , past and present , and imitate their example of steadfastness under trial .
( b ) Who are “ the branches ” of “ the true vine ” ?
Rather than producing the fruitage of true worship , Israel fell into apostasy and produced fruit for itself .
Since 1919 , they have brought forth Kingdom fruitage in abundance , first other anointed Christians and , since 1935 , an ever - increasing “ great crowd ” of companions . — Revelation 7 : 9 ; Isaiah 60 : 4 , 8 - 11 .
( b ) How will attending the Memorial help us ?
We do this by seizing every opportunity to preach the “ good news of the kingdom . ”
We also do our utmost to manifest “ the fruitage of the spirit ” in our personal lives .
What further help will be discussed in the following article ?
How this spirit helps the anointed and the other sheep to remain in Jehovah’s love will be examined in the following article .
That evening , Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will assemble to commemorate the death of the Lord , Jesus Christ .
• Who is “ the true vine ” ?
Who are “ the branches , ” and what is expected of them ?
Jesus gave his apostles an unforgettable lesson in loving service
What important information did Jesus give his disciples during his final hours with them in the upper room ?
But Jesus promised that “ the spirit of the truth ” would ‘ bring back to their minds all the things he had told them . ’
( a ) What new perspective did Jesus open up to his disciples on the night of Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . ?
On the night of Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . , Jesus intimated to his disciples that they would later be received by him and dwell with him and his Father in heaven .
He told them : “ In the house of my Father there are many abodes . Otherwise , I would have told you , because I am going my way to prepare a place for you .
Also , if I go my way and prepare a place for you , I am coming again and will receive you home to myself , that where I am you also may be . ”
The number of those sealed by the holy spirit to be part of spiritual Israel is 144,000 , “ bought from among mankind . ”
They receive unmistakably the witness of the holy spirit .
This witness of the spirit is so powerful that those who have the slightest doubt about having received the heavenly calling can reasonably conclude that they have not , and they will therefore refrain from partaking of the emblems at the Memorial .
Having in mind the limited number of Christians called to make up spiritual Israel , Jesus referred to them as the “ little flock . ”
Interestingly , the vision John received at the end of the first century C.E . distinguishes between this great crowd and the 144,000 members of spiritual Israel .
Do the other sheep also receive the holy spirit , and if so , how does it affect their lives ?
The word “ sanctification ” basically means “ the act or process of making holy , separating , or setting apart for the service or use of Jehovah God ; the state of being holy , sanctified , or purified . ”
They have been in need of food , adequate clothing , and health care .
Christ’s anointed brothers on earth in this time of the end have particularly received the active support of the other sheep in carrying out the God - given commission to ‘ preach this good news of the kingdom in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ’
Profuse thanks , therefore , to the international , multilingual ‘ great crowd ’ for the overwhelming part that they have played in the fulfilling of [ Jesus ’ ] prophecy at Matthew 24 : 14 ! ”
( b ) In what hope do the other sheep await “ the revealing of the sons of God ” ?
They can look forward to being “ set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God . ” — Romans 8 : 19 - 21 .
What has “ the spirit of the truth ” done for the anointed and their companions , and how will they be especially united on the evening of March 28 ?
Out of love , God sent his Son to give his life for the salvation of the anointed ones and the world of obedient mankind .
On the evening of March 28 , after sundown , both classes will meet together to commemorate Christ’s death and remember all that Jehovah has done for them through the sacrifice of his dear Son , Christ Jesus .
• How do the anointed know that they have received the heavenly calling ?
“ The spirit of the truth ” was poured out on the disciples at Pentecost 33 C.E .
[ Pictures on page 23 ]
“ It’s mine , ” responded eight - year - old Emmanuel .
As soon as the children were old enough to hold money in their hands , their parents taught them to drop some money into the contribution box at the Kingdom Hall .
The savings totaled $ 3.13 ( U.S . ) — no insignificant sum in a country where the average annual income is just a few hundred dollars .
In certain lands , the lives of many are threatened by food shortages and wars .
Note what Proverbs 24 : 10 says : “ Have you shown yourself discouraged in the day of distress ?
4 , 5 .
Jehovah God certainly does not cause our trials .
In the apostle Paul’s case , the Bible used the expression “ a thorn in the flesh . ”
Then we will see that we are far from alone in needing Jehovah’s help to triumph over trials .
What did Paul mean by “ a thorn in the flesh , ” and what might that thorn have been ?
Therefore , like Paul , we need to know how to cope with such thorns .
Meditating on what they endured can build our confidence that we can cope with any thorns that Satan may use against us .
9 , 10 . ( a ) How did Mephibosheth come to have a thorn in his flesh ?
Some years later King David , out of his great love for Jonathan , expressed loving - kindness to Mephibosheth .
What a fine lesson !
We too should show kindness to those contending with a thorn in the flesh .
Later on , Mephibosheth had to contend with another thorn in his flesh .
Was he badly disappointed ?
What thorns did Nehemiah have to endure when he returned to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem ?
These difficulties were like thorns that troubled him deeply because they affected the people’s relationship with Jehovah .
Wealthy ones were exacting heavy interest , and their poorer brothers , in order to pay debts as well as the Persian tax , had to give up their land and even sell their children into slavery .
Again and again he rose to the occasion as a zealous upholder of God’s righteous laws .
Esau’s two wives “ were a source of bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah , ” Esau’s parents .
And what further anguish he must have suffered when she bore two illegitimate children from her fornication ! — Hosea 1 : 2 - 9 .
What persecution afflicted the prophet Micaiah ?
Naomi had to endure the painful loss of her husband and her two sons in death .
21 , 22 .
Suddenly , his whole world seemed to collapse !
Job may well have thought that this malignant sickness was going to kill him .
What a thorn this was in his aching flesh !
Their erroneous arguments shoved the thorns in his flesh deeper and deeper , as it were .
How encouraging !
Yet , they had something in common .
An ambitious scheme of that kind would have been out of character for such an appreciative , humble man as Mephibosheth .
How Would You Answer ?
• Why can the problems we face be likened to thorns in the flesh ?
• What were some of the thorns that Mephibosheth and Nehemiah had to endure ?
Mephibosheth had to cope with disability , slander , and disappointment
[ Picture on page 16 ]
( b ) Why can we be confident in the face of trials ?
Why is that so ?
Whatever may befall us , it is neither strange nor unexpected .
What was Jehovah’s reply to Paul’s ardent request ?
Let us analyze this response and see how it can help us to cope with any thornlike problems that pain us .
Jehovah taught Paul that divine power is “ made perfect in weakness . ”
Paul’s integrity amounted to a slap in the face of that slanderer !
Paul was now serving Jehovah and Christ as “ the least of the apostles . ”
And he was enduring faithfully despite his thorn in the flesh .
Never did Paul lose his focus on the hope that he would share in Christ’s heavenly Kingdom .
7 , 8 . ( a ) By what means does Jehovah empower his servants today ?
How do we receive such help ?
Study will fortify us so that “ the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves . ”
As for those coping with a particularly painful thorn in the flesh , be they young or old , all of us can give them special consideration .
Our being positive and encouraging can help to dull some of the sharp pain of whatever thorn is afflicting them .
We may thereby prove to be a strengthening aid to them . — Colossians 4 : 11 .
* The sister relates : “ Many told me they were praying for me ; others phoned me .
( b ) What support did those in the congregation provide ?
Young ones would greet me with a hug .
And since I could not carry a book bag , other publishers put my literature in their bag when I went out in the preaching work . ”
Notice how congregation elders and fellow believers helped these two sisters to cope with their thornlike infirmities .
magazines have published many life stories and experiences of Witnesses who have coped , and are still coping , with problems in life .
In everything and in all circumstances I have learned the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger , both how to have an abundance and how to suffer want .
For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me . ” — Philippians 4 : 11 - 13 .
( b ) What are some “ things unseen ” that you hope to see in the earthly Paradise ?
Paul wrote : “ We do not give up . . . Certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day .
For though the tribulation is momentary and light , it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing weight and is everlasting ; while we keep our eyes . . . on the things unseen . For the things . . . unseen are everlasting . ” — 2 Corinthians 4 : 16 - 18 .
Most of Jehovah’s people today hope to live in his earthly Paradise and to enjoy the blessings he has promised .
Such blessings might be considered “ unseen ” to us today .
However , the time is rapidly approaching when we will see those blessings with our own eyes , yes , and enjoy them forever .
• Why and how does the Devil try to break the integrity of true Christians ?
Completely Equipped as Teachers of God’s Word
1 , 2 .
Imagine : The materials you need are spread out before you , and the tools are at hand .
Thus , one who is “ adequately qualified ” is competent and worthy to undertake a given task .
From where , though , does that qualification come ?
From superior intellect ?
Paul wrote : “ All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight , for disciplining in righteousness , that the man of God may be fully competent , completely equipped for every good work . ”
Christendom has built up a shameful record in this regard .
How did Jesus ’ attitude toward God’s Word differ from that of the religious leaders of his day ?
In fact , it was customary for a teacher in those days to hold that some Bible passages were just too profound to discuss with any but his most intimate pupil — and even then , only in a low voice and with the head covered .
True Christians make what use of the Bible ?
When we give a talk at a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses , for example , it is usually not enough to read selected verses from the Bible .
What effect can the Bible’s inspired message have on us ?
It moves people to make changes in their lives , such as turning away from the unscriptural practices of fornication , adultery , idolatry , drunkenness , and thievery .
It has helped a great many to strip off the old personality and put on the new .
Why is Jehovah’s holy spirit fittingly referred to as “ the helper ” ?
Those verses list the fruits of God’s spirit .
That quality is essential to our ministry .
Why ?
Love for Jehovah and for fellowman moves true Christians to share the good news .
How did the Pharisees feel about the common people ?
They said : “ This crowd that does not know the Law are accursed people . ”
He was aware of their pain .
Having been Jehovah’s Master Worker during creation , Jesus had a profound understanding of human nature .
If we feel that we could improve in this regard , let us pray for Jehovah’s holy spirit and then work in harmony with our prayers .
Jehovah will answer us .
He will send this irresistible force to help us be more like Christ , who was supremely qualified to preach the good news .
Nor were they equipped to fulfill Isaiah 61 : 1 - 3 , which Jesus read aloud and applied to himself .
Nothing sharpens our knowledge of a subject more than teaching it to others .
Even when we are not assigned a presentation ourselves , we can still learn to be better teachers .
What presentation will we use ?
What avenues of preaching are open to us that we may need to explore further ?
What will help us to be more effective teachers when we make return visits and conduct Bible studies ?
What evidence shows that our training has been effective , and to whom does the credit go ?
Has the training that Jehovah has provided been effective ?
We may not always feel qualified as teachers .
• Why may we be confident when engaging in the ministry ?

As Paul showed , light is closely associated with what ?
Through the Bible , Jehovah sheds light on his purposes and tells us how we can do his will .
Jesus is closely identified with spiritual light .
Walk while you have the light , so that darkness does not overpower you ; and he that walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
What basic truth about light and darkness do we find at 1 John 1 : 5 ?
Notice the contrast here between light and darkness .
Spiritual light originates with Jehovah , and spiritual darkness cannot be associated with him .
Satan’s power to influence human thinking is seen in the prophetic description of him as “ the one . . . who is misleading the entire inhabited earth . ”
The apostle Paul said that sexual immorality , theft , greediness , drunkenness , reviling , and extortion are common among those ensnared in that darkness .
But any who come to the light of God’s Word can change .
( b ) Why do many not choose the light ?
However , the joy that man felt is more than matched by the joy of those who are helped to emerge , step - by - step , from spiritual darkness into the light of truth .
When we behold their joy , we may wonder why more are not attracted to the light .
Making Progress in the Light
Since we came to a knowledge of the light , what changes have we seen in ourselves ?
It is sometimes good to look back and trace the spiritual progress we have made .
What problems in our life have we been able to put right ?
In Jehovah’s strength and with the aid of his holy spirit , we can continue to make changes in our personality and pattern of thinking that will show that we are responding to the light .
Helping others to abandon the darkness and choose the light calls for courage on our part .
Beware of Decoy Lights !
In the matter of light , what warning should we heed ?
To those at sea during the hours of darkness , any light is a welcome sight .
If we entertain the false reasonings of such ones , our confidence in Jehovah’s Word of truth , the Bible , can be weakened and our faith can die . — 2 Corinthians 11 : 13 - 15 ; 1 Timothy 1 : 19 .
Likewise , we can set things straight and humbly accept discipline in righteousness to keep our feet on the road to life .
How can we show appreciation for Jehovah’s wonderful provision of light ?
How can we show appreciation for Jehovah’s wonderful provision of light ?
He put faith in Jesus as the Son of God and publicly identified him as “ a prophet . ”
Because they have the same grateful spirit as the man who was born blind and who was healed .
Those with an earthly hope have the same thankful spirit , and they support their anointed brothers in the public declaration of Jehovah’s “ excellencies . ”
( b ) In imitation of Timothy , what is each Christian encouraged to avoid ?
Young or old , each one of us needs to cultivate a deep appreciation for the truth that Jehovah has revealed .
He was then in a position to assist the apostle Paul , who exhorted him : “ Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God , a workman with nothing to be ashamed of , handling the word of the truth aright . ”
( b ) What will be discussed in the following article ?
“ You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ” — JOHN 8 : 32 .
Indeed , such teachings are deceptive .
Today , “ trickery of men ” is promoted by the propaganda of those who oppose divine truth .
Referring to those who had become his disciples , Jesus Christ prayed to Jehovah : “ Sanctify them by means of the truth ; your word is truth . ”
Although not the possession of all people , Jehovah’s truth is available as a free gift to all who seek it , whatever their nationality , race , or cultural background .
Why are Christians often persecuted ?
Commenting on this verse , Irish cleric John R .
For this reason , “ God lets an operation of error go to them , that they may get to believing the lie , in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness . ” — 2 Thessalonians 2 : 10 - 12 .
As a result , 263,431 persons were baptized .
Despite our imperfections , Jehovah graciously accepts our dedication , reaching down , as it were , to draw us to him .
This was later described as “ the congregation of the living God , a pillar and support of the truth . ”
Jesus identified members of that congregation as “ the faithful and discreet slave ” and as “ the faithful steward , the discreet one . ”
Likewise , without partaking of spiritual food , we weaken and die spiritually .
Do you remember precisely what you ate six months , or even six weeks , ago ?
Perhaps we do not recall every detail of what we have heard at the meetings .
Our preparing for , attending , and participating in all Christian meetings is faith - strengthening for us individually and encouraging to others .
It is loving to provide that encouragement when needed so that such ones can develop into mature Christians , of whom the apostle Paul wrote : “ Solid food belongs to mature people , to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ” — Hebrews 5 : 14 .
Many believe that if they had more money , they would be happier .
In the year 36 C.E . , he made a missionary journey to the Plain of Sharon .
This fleeting reference reveals Peter’s unprejudiced attitude as he ministered to the people in that city .
The daily contact with the hides and carcases of various animals necessitated by this trade , and the materials which it requires , rendered it impure and disgusting in the eyes of all rigid legalists . ”
But three times he was told : “ Stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed . ”
There he preached to Cornelius and his relatives and friends .
As a result , they became the first uncircumcised Gentile believers to receive the holy spirit as Kingdom heirs .
What an extraordinary privilege for Peter — all because the truth was precious to him and led him to heed direction from Jehovah and act in faith !
Paul exhorts : “ Speaking the truth , let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head , Christ . ”
Yes , the truth will bring us unparalleled happiness now if we put it first in our lives and allow Jehovah through his holy spirit to direct our steps .
• What should be our attitude toward meetings , and why ?

“ Now , This May Hurt ”
Emphasizing this need on the part of children , the Bible says : “ Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy ; the rod of discipline is what will remove it far from him . ” — Proverbs 22 : 15 .
The rod , in this instance , is a symbol of parental authority .
Christian parents know that God’s Word is true when it says : “ No discipline seems for the present to be joyous , but grievous ; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit , namely , righteousness . ” — Hebrews 12 : 11 ; Proverbs 13 : 24 .
The Bible is speaking to adults when it says : “ Take hold on discipline ; do not let go . Safeguard it , for it itself is your life . ”
IT WAS Tuesday , Nisan 11 .
He said : “ Do not you be called Rabbi , for one is your teacher , whereas all you are brothers .
Clearly , Jesus Christ is the Leader of true Christians .
Listening to Jehovah and accepting the Leader he has appointed have what effect on our lives ?
Foretelling the coming of this Leader , Jehovah God declared through the prophet Isaiah : “ Hey there , all you thirsty ones !
Come to the water . And the ones that have no money ! Come , buy and eat .
The result is refreshing .
As milk strengthens babies and helps them to grow , ‘ the milk of the word ’ fortifies us and promotes spiritual growth in our relationship with God .
Youths ​ — Go On “ Progressing in Wisdom ”
If we need physical food every day , how much more so do we need spiritual food on a regular basis !
“ I make it a point to read at least one chapter a day , ” she says .
She answers : “ Bad influences today are plentiful .
As a result , I feel closer to Jehovah and Jesus . ”
What was Jesus ’ custom regarding the synagogue , and how can young ones imitate him ?
She also spends from two to three hours preparing for them . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 15 , 16 .
Our accepting Christ’s leadership contributes to peace and happiness in the family .
The Scriptures state : “ Be in subjection to one another in fear of Christ .
Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord , because a husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation , he being a savior of this body . . . .
Man’s headship , though , results in happiness only when it is handled properly .
Such words as “ I am sorry ” or “ you are right ” are not difficult for him to say when he is wrong .
The Bible also holds the husband or father accountable , and when its counsel is applied , this contributes to peace and order in the family . ​ — Philippians 2 : 5 .
Children’s subjection to their parents contributes to peace and harmony in the family .
14 , 15 .
We also need wisdom to apply godly principles properly .
We are happy if we act the way he would .
‘ Keep On Seeking First the Kingdom ’
What should occupy the central place in our lives , and how did Jesus show this by his example ?
Satan the Devil offered him rulership over “ all the kingdoms of the world . ”
We do well to imitate our Leader and not allow Satan’s world to lure us into making a high - paying job and career our main goal in life .
And how encouraging it is that during the 2001 service year , some 780,000 were able to serve as full - time ministers , or pioneers !
What helps us find joy in the ministry ?
“ When I was in my teens , ” says a young man named Jayson , “ I did not particularly enjoy the ministry . ”
Some names have been changed .

I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ​ — MATTHEW 28 : 20 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) When giving the command to make disciples , what did the resurrected Jesus promise his followers ?
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you .
Moreover , our Leader provided direction to the congregation by arranging for qualified men to serve as a governing body . ​ — Acts 1 : 20 , 24 - 26 ; 6 : 1 - 6 ; 8 : 5 , 14 - 17 .
As in the first century , a small group of qualified men from among the anointed overseers now serve as the Governing Body , representing the composite faithful and discreet slave .
The recommendations and appointments are made after prayer and under the guidance of the holy spirit .
How can we show regard for the appointed elders in the congregation ?
Our attitude and actions toward them speak volumes as to whether we accept Christ’s leadership .
How can we display our gratitude and esteem for the older men ​ — elders , or overseers — ​ in the congregation ?
Referring to those who spoke abusively of the appointed men in the congregation , the disciple Jude pointed to three warning examples , saying : “ Too bad for them , because they have gone in the path of Cain , and have rushed into the erroneous course of Balaam for reward , and have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah ! ”
As elders fulfill their responsibility , they sincerely try to serve others .
Christians are urged : “ Remember those who are taking the lead among you , . . . and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith . ”
This is not required because elders are leaders .
Even though Jesus was superior to imperfect humans in every way and possessed unmatched authority from his Father , he was modest in his dealings with his disciples .
How should elders show Christlike modesty in their relationship with others in the congregation ?
If Christ the Leader displayed modesty , how much more so should those taking the lead in the congregation !
Yes , they are careful not to abuse any authority entrusted to them .
And are not elders who are humble and mild - tempered truly refreshing ?
Jesus was approachable and accessible , even to lesser ones .
“ Let the young children come to me , ” said Jesus , “ do not try to stop them . ”
As we approach the end of this system of things , our position is comparable to that of the Israelites on the Plains of Moab in 1473 B.C.E .
They were at the threshold of the Promised Land , and through the prophet Moses , God declared : “ You [ Joshua ] will bring this people into the land that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them . ”
Joshua was the appointed leader .
Only Christ will lead us into the promised new world in which righteousness is to dwell .
Jesus would hardly use a human to record information for invisible spirit creatures .
Their number being seven signifies divinely determined completeness .
• Why should we be submissive to those taking the lead in the congregation ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
Christian elders endeavor to be like him
Did her egg cell , or ovum , contribute at all toward her pregnancy ?
Conception requires that an egg become fertile .
Apparently , Jehovah God caused an ovum in Mary’s womb to become fertile , accomplishing this by the transferal of the life of his only - begotten Son from the spirit realm to earth . ​ — Galatians 4 : 4 .
How do the laws of heredity work when there is a union of perfection with imperfection ?
The angel Gabriel had explained to Mary : “ Holy spirit will come upon you , and power of the Most High will overshadow you . For that reason also what is born will be called holy , God’s Son . ”
[ Picture on page 19 ]
“ There are too many ‘ religious ’ people who become religious precisely to avoid having to think , ” writes the dean of a theological seminary in the United States .
Regrettably , such practices as using religious images and repeating prayers by rote also discourage reasoning .
Others turn to preaching a social or political gospel .
Concerning the situation in North America , one religion writer said : “ Christianity . . . tends to be superficial , [ and ] its adherents are poorly educated in the faith . ”
The painter may be pleased with his work , but would it be acceptable to the owner ?
The Bible answers : “ This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior , God , whose will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
But think ​ — if it is God’s will that people should come to an accurate knowledge of truth , would he unfairly conceal it from them ?
For example , a number of people in the Macedonian city of Beroea “ received the word [ of God ] with the greatest eagerness of mind , carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things [ explained by Paul and his companions ] were so . ”
Mind and Heart Cooperate
As mentioned earlier , true worship involves both the mind and the heart .
If he had listened carefully to his employer’s instructions , he could have put his heart and soul into his work and had confidence that his work would have the owner’s approval .
Millions regularly recite Jesus ’ model prayer in church .
Because it has been reproached and maligned from the very beginning of human history .
Concerning that passage , we may ask : ‘ What is God’s Kingdom ?
Logically , then , God’s Kingdom would refer to a rulership , or government , by God , with a king of his choosing .
And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people . It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms , and it itself will stand to times indefinite , ” that is , forever . ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 .
Of course , these ones have accurate knowledge of God , which is a requirement for life . ​ — Matthew 5 : 5 ; John 17 : 3 .
In effect , Jesus put relevant Bible texts together like the pieces of a puzzle , which enabled his disciples to see a clear pattern of spiritual truth .
These address dozens of interesting Bible topics , such as : “ Who Is God ? , ” “ Why Does God Permit Suffering ? , ” “ How Can You Find the True Religion ? , ” “ These Are the Last Days ! , ” and “ Building a Family That Honors God . ”
Do you grasp the meaning of Jesus ’ model prayer ?
THE Frankish King Charlemagne compelled the conquered Saxons to get baptized en masse in 775 - 77 C.E .
Baptism ​ — How ?
Greek words translated “ baptize , ” “ baptism , ” and so forth , refer to immersing , dipping , or plunging under water .
Certain Bible translations thus refer to “ John the Immerser ” and “ John the dipper . ”
And the New Catholic Encyclopedia states : “ It is evident that Baptism in the early Church was by immersion . ”
On that occasion , Peter used the first of “ the keys of the kingdom . ”
They could give public evidence of such faith by being immersed in water in the name of Jesus Christ .
Accurate Knowledge Essential
Why is Christian baptism not for everyone ?
Baptismal candidates must also acknowledge the “ superior position ” to which God has exalted his Son . ​ — Philippians 2 : 8 - 11 ; Revelation 19 : 16 .
Those qualifying for baptism acknowledge that the holy spirit helps them to understand “ the deep things of God , ” to carry on the Kingdom - preaching work , and to display the spirit’s fruitage of “ love , joy , peace , long - suffering , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self - control . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 ; Galatians 5 : 22 , 23 ; Joel 2 : 28 , 29 .
Repentance is a vital step toward gaining a good conscience and God - given relief from guilt over sin . ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 21 .
Conversion must take place prior to our baptism as Witnesses of Jehovah .
In the Scriptures , Hebrew and Greek verbs pertaining to conversion have the sense of turning back , turning around .
This step is so important that we should express to Jehovah in prayer our decision to give him exclusive devotion forever .
Of course , our dedication is not to a work or to a human but to God himself .
How can our joy appropriately be shown when we see people get baptized ?
Jesus ’ baptism was a serious but joyful event .
Unlike those who sprinkle babies or force Scripturally uninformed masses to be baptized , Jehovah’s Witnesses never coerce anyone into baptism .
Some do not qualify and therefore are not accepted for Christian baptism .
Is Something Holding You Back ?
In view of John 6 : 44 , who will be Jesus ’ joint heirs ?
Though some people realize that Jehovah’s Witnesses ‘ worship God with spirit and truth , ’ they have not yet followed Jesus ’ example and given public evidence of genuine love and exclusive devotion to Jehovah by getting baptized .
21 , 22 .
What fears should not hold individuals back from baptism ?
As a proselyte , he had some knowledge of the Scriptures , but he could not answer every question about God’s purposes .
He will help us to “ go on walking in the truth ” as his faithful dedicated servants . ​ — Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 ; 3 John 4 .
Because of implicit trust in Jehovah and heartfelt love for him , each year thousands are moved to make a dedication and get baptized .
This we will consider in the next article .
[ Footnote ]
Do You Recall ?
• What steps lead up to the baptism of true Christians ?
Therefore , we can have conviction like that of the psalmist David , who was moved to sing : “ My heart is steadfast , O God . ”
We “ grow mighty ” by continually looking to our heavenly Father for strength to do his will . ​ — Philippians 4 : 13 .
Why should we continue to take in Scriptural knowledge ?
Now it is essential to keep on taking in rich spiritual food so that we maintain a steadfast heart as Jehovah’s dedicated servants .
But how rewarding it is to find “ the very knowledge of God ” !
How is it possible to maintain godly conduct ?
Do you recall the relief you felt when you learned the truth , repented , and then had a sense of God’s forgiveness based on faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice ?
What points should we keep in mind regarding our dedication to God ?
Your dedication was neither a temporary agreement nor a commitment to men .
Yes , ‘ live or die , we belong to Jehovah . ’
Our happiness depends on our submission to his will and our continuing to serve him with a steadfast heart .
Thus we imitate Jesus , who exercised his will when he laid aside his carpenter’s tools , got baptized , and devoted himself fully to the doing of his heavenly Father’s will . ​ — Psalm 40 : 7 , 8 ; John 6 : 38 - 40 .
If we display similar reverential fear of God , we too are sure to be “ favorably heard , ” and we can be confident that Jehovah will make us steadfast as his dedicated Witnesses . ​ — Isaiah 43 : 10 .
If Jehovah’s organization knowingly endorsed false teachings , advice to read the Bible would never be given to Jehovah’s Witnesses and those to whom they preach .
Do you endeavor to make it help you in advancing true worship ?
But how their heart welled up with joy , gratitude , and love for God when they embraced the Kingdom hope !
Reflecting on the blessings they have enjoyed since then may well help them to live up to their dedication to Jehovah .
When tempted to do wrong or when faced with a severe trial , seek God’s guidance and his help to follow it .
If you are repentant , you can take comfort in the knowledge that Jehovah ‘ will not despise a heart broken and crushed . ’
Seek the help of loving Christian elders , knowing that they ​ — in imitation of Jehovah — ​ will not treat lightly your desire to experience the restoration of a good relationship with your heavenly Father .
In these critical times , we must work hard to live up to our dedication and keep on serving God with a steadfast heart .
If your heart is steadfast , it will be reliant upon God , and with his help you will be able to fulfill your dedication .
Yes , you can be like “ the righteous one ” concerning whom the psalmist sang : “ He will not be afraid even of bad news . His heart is steadfast , made reliant upon Jehovah . ”
• How do we benefit from remembering our dedication and baptism ?
KSENIYA was born in 1897 .
If a centenarian does not feel too old to learn the meaning of life from the Bible , how about you ?
Even in this troubled world , you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God , his Kingdom , and his wonderful purpose for mankind .
OBEYING divine laws is not popular today .
For many , deferring to an invisible higher authority seems pointless .
We live in an era of moral relativism , of blurred boundaries between right and wrong , and of huge gray areas .
Reflecting a way of thinking that is common in many secularized societies , a recent poll noted that “ most Americans want to decide for themselves what is right , good and meaningful . ”
No strong superiors , moral or otherwise . ”
A social analyst observed that today “ individuals are expected to determine for themselves what it means to lead a good and virtuous life . ”
How did God reward Abraham’s obedience , including obedience to His laws ?
( a ) What feeling toward Jehovah’s law did one psalmist express ?
He exclaimed to God : “ How I do love your law ! ”
Jesus was prophetically described as saying : “ To do your will , O my God , I have delighted , and your law is within my inward parts . ”
If a person goes contrary to some physical laws , such as the law of gravity , he experiences the consequences .
They are enforced as surely as are his natural laws , though the outcome may not be as immediate .
For whatever a man is sowing , this he will also reap . ” ​ — Galatians 6 : 7 ; 1 Timothy 5 : 24 .
The Scope of Jehovah’s Law
An outstanding expression of divine law was the Law of Moses .
* As Christians under “ the perfect law that belongs to freedom , ” we appreciate that God does not limit his directives to certain aspects of our life , such as doctrinal beliefs or ceremonial rites .
These are violations of Jehovah’s law .
Should we not esteem it similarly , allowing it to shape our life pattern ?
How does Jehovah’s knowledge of us make him the best Lawgiver ?
Close friends , relatives , even parents cannot know us as well as Jehovah does .
Our Maker has unparalleled comprehension of our spiritual , emotional , mental , and physical needs .
In the turbulent times in which we live , Jehovah is a rock of stability , existing from everlasting to everlasting .
Worldly standards and guidelines on this matter sway to and fro as though buffeted by winds .
However , Jehovah’s Word is unwavering .
( b ) How can God’s laws prove to be a sound guide in marriage ?
The kind of love that is needed is described at 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 - 8 : “ Love is long - suffering and kind . Love is not jealous , it does not brag , does not get puffed up , does not behave indecently , does not look for its own interests , does not become provoked .
It does not keep account of the injury .
Another evidence that Jehovah’s standards are beneficial , is the fact that he condemns drunkenness .
He even disapproves of ‘ giving oneself to a lot of wine . ’
Many who ignore God’s standards on this matter suffer diseases caused or aggravated by excessive drinking .
Explain .
19 , 20 .
Why is it the course of wisdom to accept and hold to divine laws ?
In order to do this successfully , we also need to appreciate the value of godly principles .
How does the Creator lead humans ?
Jesus linked obedience to God with love when he said : “ If anyone loves me , he will observe my word , and my Father will love him . ”
The key principles provided by Jehovah have a bearing on our relationship with him and with fellow humans , our worship , and our everyday lives .
Let us consider some of those fundamental principles .
How are principles distinguished from laws ?
May they not get away from your eyes . Keep them in the midst of your heart .
How does God’s Word encourage us to think and act on the basis of principles ?
Time and again , “ the word of our God ” encourages us to think and act on the basis of principles .
For the true God himself will bring every sort of work into the judgment in relation to every hidden thing , as to whether it is good or bad . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 12 : 13 , 14 ; Micah 6 : 8 .
Why is it a protection to have a firm grasp of basic Bible principles ?
Why is it not always easy to discern and apply Bible principles ?
We may prefer the convenience of a rule when we are faced with a decision or a dilemma .
Yet , the Bible or Bible - based publications may not provide a definite rule , and even if we are given one , it might not be a blanket guide for all times and under all circumstances .
You may remember that a certain man asked Jesus : “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . ”
How does conducting ourselves in harmony with principles reveal the motives of our heart ?
You have probably seen people who are inclined to obey laws grudgingly , out of fear of a penalty .
Respect for principles precludes such an attitude .
In fact , most principles do not involve an immediate punishment for those not conforming to them .
This gives us the opportunity to reveal why we obey Jehovah , what our heart motivation is .
Though Jehovah had not yet given a written law against adultery and no divine sentence was prescribed for having relations with another man’s wife , Joseph was aware of the principles of God - ordained marital faithfulness .
What is a key to being guided by godly principles ?
Remember that Jesus ’ listeners were Jews , so their conduct should have been governed by the Mosaic Law .
We should certainly not try to earn God’s favor through moral formalism .
Appreciating these underlying principles makes it easier to accept and follow the related laws .
Letting our life be guided by Bible principles leads to a superior way of life , which in itself may attract others to the way of God .

“ When he saw the crowds he went up into the mountain ; and after he sat down his disciples came to him ; and he opened his mouth and began teaching them . ” ​ — MATTHEW 5 : 1 , 2
How a Son Helped His Father
He selected one with a reproduction of a Memorial invitation on the back page and rushed to his father .
He pointed first to the picture and then to his father and said “ You ! ”
To her great surprise , James ’ father turned to him and said , “ James , if I go to the meeting today , will you go too ? ”
From that day , James ’ father continued to attend all the Sunday meetings and soon announced that if he was to make progress , he would have to attend the other meetings too .
One year after he began to study the Bible , he dedicated his life to Jehovah and symbolized this by water immersion .
As such , his name and purposes deserve to be magnified .
How does Jehovah deal with those who magnify him and with those who do not ?
The first chapter draws our attention to at least six points crucial to our magnifying Jehovah with thanksgiving so as to gain his favor and everlasting life : ( 1 ) Jehovah loves his people .
So , then , in this first of three articles on the book of Malachi , let us consider each of those points as we take a closer look at Malachi chapter 1 .
5 , 6 . ( a ) Why did Jehovah love Jacob ?
Further , God says : “ I have loved you people . ”
Why did Paul link Esau’s actions to fornication ?
He said to Jacob : “ Quick , please , give me a swallow of the red . ”
Instead of being like Esau , let us be like faithful Jacob and maintain reverential fear of God by showing deep appreciation for sacred things .
Jehovah of armies has said to you , O priests who are despising my name . ”
“ By presenting upon my altar polluted bread , ” Jehovah replied .
“ In what way have we polluted you ? ”
Those priests showed that they despised Jehovah’s table each time they presented a defective sacrifice , saying : “ It is nothing bad . ”
Will he find pleasure in you , or will he receive you kindly ? ”
Giving Jehovah the best we can is the way to show that we really love him .
What were the priests doing that showed that they were motivated by greed ?
Malachi 1 : 10 says : “ ‘ Who also is there among you that will shut the doors ? And you men will not light my altar ​ — for nothing .
No delight do I have in you , ’ Jehovah of armies has said , ‘ and in the gift offering from your hand I take no pleasure . ’ ”
Like Paul , each of us can truthfully say : “ Without cost I gladly declared the good news of God to you . ”
Notice that Paul “ gladly declared the good news . ”
Service to God Not a Burdensome Formality
15 , 16 . ( a ) What attitude did the priests have toward offering sacrifices ?
and you have caused a sniffing at it . ”
Those priests sniffed at , or scorned , God’s sacred things .
Hebrews 13 : 15 states : “ Through [ Jesus Christ ] let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name . ”
Individuals living in Malachi’s day bore personal responsibility for their deeds , and so do we .
• What should be the motivation for true worship ?
[ Picture on page 10 ]
[ Picture on page 11 ]
‘ Do not deal treacherously with one another . ’ ​ — MALACHI 2 : 10 .
What does God require of us if we are to receive everlasting life ?
Is it unreasonable to expect imperfect humans to do that ?
So even mistake - prone humans can meet God’s requirements .
Yet , before long they were ‘ overstepping the covenant ’ by breaking his laws .
Thus , Jehovah said that those Israelites “ dealt treacherously ” with him .
What analysis will be made in this study ?
In the preceding article , we began an analysis of much of Malachi’s prophetic message , starting with the first chapter of his book .
Even the blessings the priests uttered would turn out to be a curse .
So those priests deserved to be called to account .
Note the strong words that Jehovah directs against them .
But when Jehovah tells them that the dung would instead be scattered on their faces , it clearly shows that he held in contempt and rejected their sacrifices and those offering them .
You have ruined the covenant of Levi . . . You were not keeping my ways . ”
Keeping God’s Standards
Is it too much to expect humans to keep God’s standards ?
Likely , some individual priests back then did keep God’s standards , and there is no doubt about one who later did ​ — Jesus , the great “ high priest . ”
They have helped to turn many back from religious error , so that now there are millions throughout the world who have learned Bible truths and who have the hope of everlasting life .
Why do we have reason to be cautious ?
We could miss the lessons that are implicit in Malachi 2 : 1 - 9 .
It would be easy to develop the habit of couching one’s words in terms that are technically accurate but misleading .
Or one might exaggerate or hide details in a business matter .
That would especially be a risk for a person tending to be confident in his own conclusions even when these contradict what Jehovah’s organization is teaching .
From Mal 2 verse 10 onward , Malachi chapter 2 highlights treachery even more directly .
This did not mean Jacob ( renamed Israel ) or Abraham or even Adam .
Malachi 1 : 6 shows that Jehovah was the “ one father . ”
( b ) How does Jehovah express himself on the matter of marriage ?
Some today might reason : ‘ The person I’m attracted to is very nice .
Such thinking confirms the inspired warning : “ The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . ”
Later , Jesus showed that immorality is the only ground for a divorce that would free the innocent mate to remarry . ​ — Matthew 19 : 9 .
While that marriage probably took place when he and she were young , the passing of time and the onset of older age did not invalidate the covenant they had entered into , that is , the marriage contract .
Back in Malachi’s time , those who ignored divine counsel even had the audacity to feel that Jehovah was unjustified in his views .
What perverse thinking !
Let us not fall into that trap . ​ — Malachi 2 : 17 .
What time is nearing for all mankind ?
“ Each of us will render an account for himself to God . ”
The third and final article in this series will take up that theme .
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Who Will Survive the Day of Jehovah ?
THE prophet Malachi was inspired by God to record prophecies of awesome events that will take place in the very near future .
How complete will be the destruction of this wicked system of things ?
In the major fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy , “ the day of Jehovah ” is a period of time characterized by “ great tribulation . ”
Think of the distress the world has already seen , especially since 1914 .
Yet , “ the great tribulation ” will see calamities that will dwarf such troubles .
By the end of that day of Jehovah , Satan’s world and its supporters will have been annihilated .
As Jehovah says , the healed ones will “ go forth and paw the ground like fattened calves ” that are excited and delighted to be released from confinement .
Malachi 4 : 3 states : “ ‘ You people [ God’s servants ] will certainly tread down the wicked ones , for they will become as powder under the soles of your feet in the day on which I am acting , ’ Jehovah of armies has said . ”
7 , 8 .
Describe the spiritual condition of Israel in Malachi’s time .
Consequently , Jehovah told them : “ I will come near to you people for the judgment , and I will become a speedy witness against the sorcerers , and against the adulterers , and against those swearing falsely , and against those acting fraudulently with the wages of a wage worker , with the widow and with the fatherless boy , and those turning away the alien resident , while they have not feared me , . . . for I am Jehovah ; I have not changed . ”
How did Malachi’s prophecies have a preliminary fulfillment ?
Those words also had a fulfillment in the first century C.E .
Jerusalem and her temple were destroyed , and it is reported that over one million people died as a result of famine , power struggles , and attacks by the Roman armies .
In what way do people in general and the clergy imitate first - century Israel ?
The clergy are especially at fault .
For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning , that we should have love for one another ; not like Cain , who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother . ” ​ — 1 John 3 : 10 - 12 .
John did an Elijahlike work when he baptized Jews who had repented of their sins against the Law covenant .
Malachi’s prophecy showed that this great Elijah work would be done before “ the great and fear - inspiring day of Jehovah . ”
True to that prophecy , before Jehovah destroys this wicked system , the modern - day Elijah class , supported by millions of fellow Christians with an earthly hope , enthusiastically carry on the work of restoring pure worship , exalting the name of Jehovah , and teaching Bible truths to sheeplike ones .
To these Jehovah says : “ Bring all the tenth parts into the storehouse , that there may come to be food in my house ; and test me out , please , in this respect . . . whether I shall not open to you people the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out upon you a blessing until there is no more want . ” ​ — Malachi 3 : 10 .
One way is with increased understanding of his purposes .
Another is by giving them amazing fruitage in their preaching work .
You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth , released in 1982 , reached more than 81 million in 131 languages .
But exult , you people , and be joyful forever in what I am creating . ” ​ — Isaiah 65 : 17 , 18 ; Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 ; Revelation 21 : 4 , 5 .
We believe Jehovah’s promise that his loyal people will survive his great day and be brought into the new world .
So while we all have our problems and challenges , as we face this day of Jehovah , we have every reason for being the most joyful people on the face of the earth .
First - century Jerusalem ‘ burned like the furnace ’
SOME 4,000 years ago , Abraham’s nephew Lot said of Jehovah : “ You are magnifying your loving - kindness . ”
Why is the Hebrew word translated “ loving - kindness ” so hard to define , and what is an appropriate alternate rendering of it ?
In the Scriptures , “ loving - kindness ” is a translation of a Hebrew term so rich in meaning that most languages have no single word exactly expressing its full sense .
King David could therefore petition Jehovah : “ Do cause your face to shine upon your servant . Save me in your loving - kindness . ”
( b ) When did Lot make mention of Jehovah’s loving - kindness ?
At Genesis 14 : 1 - 16 , we find that Lot , the nephew of Abraham , was carried off by enemy forces .
With these words Lot acknowledged that Jehovah had shown exceptional loving - kindness by rescuing him .
In Genesis chapter 24 , we read about another expression of divine loving - kindness , or loyal love .
When he saw the women coming closer , he knew that the crucial moment of his mission had arrived .
The servant asked for a specific sign by which he could identify the young woman of God’s choosing .
Why , it was as if she had overheard his prayer !
11 , 12 . ( a ) During what trials did Joseph experience Jehovah’s loving - kindness ?
( b ) How was God’s loving - kindness expressed in Joseph’s case ?
Next , let us consider Genesis chapter 39 .
It was “ in the prison hole ” that “ with fetters they afflicted his feet , into irons his soul came . ” ​ — Genesis 40 : 15 ; Psalm 105 : 18 .
What happened during that particularly trying experience ?
In turn , the king elevated Joseph to the position of second ruler in Egypt , resulting in his performing a life - saving work in the famine - stricken land of Egypt .
Joseph’s suffering began when he was 17 years old and lasted for more than a dozen years !
( a ) What expressions of Jehovah’s loving - kindness are found in Psalm 136 ?
Psalm 136 relates that in his loving - kindness , he granted them deliverance , guidance , and protection .
A person who shows loving - kindness to fellow humans does so by voluntary deeds intended to fill a crucial need .
The Genesis accounts that we have examined show us that Jehovah never fails to display loving - kindness to those who love him .
Lot made some unwise decisions that led to hardships .
Yes , Lot was a righteous man , and the wording here implies that he was a person of godly devotion .
Abraham’s servant called Jehovah “ the God of my master Abraham . ”
They faced obstacles that they could not have overcome by themselves .
At stake were the preservation of Lot’s life , the continuation of Abraham’s family line , and the securing of Joseph’s role .
Only Jehovah could fill the needs of these godly men , and he did just that by intervening with acts of loving - kindness .
God’s Servants Are Favored
We rejoice that Jehovah extends his loving - kindness to his approved servants ​ — either as individuals or as a group .
[ Picture on page 13 ]
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why should we display loving - kindness ?
JEHOVAH GOD’S Word exhorts us to love “ loving - kindness . ”
As a result , we will have loyal friends ​ — a precious reward indeed ! ​ — Proverbs 18 : 24 .
Moreover , the Scriptures tell us : “ He that is pursuing righteousness and loving - kindness will find life . ”
Or they may be founded on relationships resulting from prior acts of kindness .
They were washed ashore on the island of Malta .
Although the Maltese had neither a prior commitment to the stranded voyagers nor an existing relationship with them , the islanders received the strangers hospitably , showing them “ extraordinary human kindness . ”
Yet , they express enduring loving - kindness , or loyal love , to those with whom they share a God - approved relationship . ​ — Matthew 5 : 45 ; Galatians 6 : 10 .
Moreover , these accounts illustrate how we may exercise loving - kindness today .
The servant no doubt hoped that his heartfelt recounting of the incident would convince Bethuel and his son Laban that Jehovah was behind this mission .
Who would be in a better position to make sure that his wish would be carried out than his influential son , Joseph ?
And I must lie with my fathers , and you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their grave . ’ ” Joseph promised to comply with this request , and shortly thereafter Jacob died .
Thus Joseph exercised loving - kindness toward his father .
11 , 12 . ( a ) How did Ruth show loving - kindness to Naomi ?
( b ) In what way was “ the last instance ” of Ruth’s loving - kindness better than “ the first ” ?
Ruth later expressed her loving - kindness when she indicated her willingness to marry Naomi’s elderly relative Boaz .
“ The first instance ” of Ruth’s loving - kindness referred to the time when she left her people and stuck with Naomi .
Ruth truly was “ an excellent woman , ” who thus was rewarded by Jehovah with the wonderful privilege of becoming an ancestress of Jesus Christ . ​ — Ruth 2 : 12 ; 3 : 11 ; 4 : 18 - 22 ; Matthew 1 : 1 , 5 , 6 .
Expressed by Actions
How did Bethuel , Joseph , and Ruth exercise their loving - kindness ?
( a ) How do God’s present - day servants show loving - kindness by actions ?
If you are , be assured that your loving - kindness is deeply appreciated .
Bethuel willingly cooperated with Abraham’s servant , and so did Rebekah .
What makes the loving - kindness of Bethuel , Joseph , and Ruth especially meaningful , and what moved them to display this quality ?
Bethuel , Joseph , and Ruth showed loving - kindness willingly ; they were moved to do so from within .
( a ) With what attitude do Christian elders “ shepherd the flock ” ?
“ I love to make visits at the homes of brothers or call them for no other reason than to show I was thinking of them , ” says one Christian elder .
To have his remains taken to Canaan , Jacob needed Joseph’s help .
Actually , there are ‘ afflicted ones crying for help ’ in every Christian congregation .
No matter what the cause , all such dear ones have needs that can and should be filled by our willing and enduring acts of loving - kindness . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 14 .
We can do so by willingly taking specific action , particularly in behalf of those in need .
And surely we will honor Jehovah and experience great joy as we “ carry on with one another loving - kindness . ” ​ — Zechariah 7 : 9 .
For details on the type of marriage involved here , see Volume 1 , page 370 , of Insight on the Scriptures , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Human loving - kindness is extended willingly , is shown by specific action , and is displayed to those in need
DEATH casts a shadow over us as we go about our daily life , no matter how physically fit or rich we may be .
It can strike the next time we cross a street or lie in bed .
Such disasters as the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , in New York City and Washington , D.C . , bring us face - to - face with the fact that “ the last enemy , ” death , gathers its victims from all walks of life and from all age groups , sometimes taking thousands in a matter of minutes . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 .
Even so , death seems to fascinate people .
Why is that ?
“ He has also put eternity in their hearts , ” says Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 , according to the Anchor Bible .
We should not , therefore , be surprised that human society in general finds death a challenging prospect .
For one thing , death exposes the ultimate futility of a life devoted to the pursuit of wealth and power .
Alienated by Death ?
In such cases , the family comes together , and the children are included in the conversation .
Although most would like to die at home , peacefully and lovingly tended by family , for many the hard reality is that they die in a hospital , usually isolated and in pain , tethered to a frightening array of high - tech equipment .
This can help us to live our life in a more meaningful way rather than simply to muddle through or waste it .
With him is “ the source of life , ” and to him “ belong the ways out from death . ”
Surprising as it may seem , an examination of some popular beliefs about death in the light of God’s Word will prove both comforting and refreshing .
A Closer Look at Some Myths About Death
Comments like this reflect the belief that death is normal , the natural ending of all living organisms .
For instance , Calvin Harley , a biologist who studies human aging , said in an interview that he does not believe that humans “ have a program to die . ”
When scientists study the design of humans , they are baffled .
Even those who claim that death is natural to humans find it hard to accept the idea that their own death will mean the end of everything .
Yet , this is what many religions teach about death ​ — that God takes people to be near him .
No , not the God of the Bible .
Heaven , hell , purgatory , Limbo ​ — these and various other destinations range from being incomprehensible to being downright terrifying .
Jesus spoke of a time when “ all those in the memorial tombs ” would “ come out ” to renewed life on a paradise earth . ​ — John 5 : 28 , 29 ; Luke 23 : 43 .
God is not responsible for such eventualities .
Myth 5 : Death means the permanent end of our existence .
We cease to exist when we die , but this does not mean that everything is necessarily finished .
But listen to his prayer to God : “ O that in Sheol you would conceal me , that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back , that you would set a time limit for me and remember me !
And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . The former things have passed away . ’ ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
What ways of people today have led to disastrous results ?
Obviously , no law or standard proposed by any human , no matter how intelligent or sincere , can meet that need .
Furthermore , the Bible describes Jehovah as “ a God of faithfulness , with whom there is no injustice ; righteous and upright is he . ”
In fact , most people take a negative , even derogatory , view of it , equating it with being sanctimonious , or hypocritically pious and devout .
However , according to one dictionary , “ righteous ” means “ just , upright , virtuous ; guiltless , sinless ; conforming to the precepts of divine law or accepted standards of morality ; acting rightly or justly . ”
Indeed they were .
How is Jehovah’s righteousness expressed ?
The Law spelled out in minute detail how the Israelites were to conduct themselves not only in religious matters but also in business dealings , marital relations , dietary and sanitary practices and , of course , judicial decisions .
* But were God’s righteous requirements , as expressed in the Law , a harsh and tiresome burden to the people , robbing them of their freedom and joy , as many people today claim ?
Also , your own servant has been warned by them ; in the keeping of them there is a large reward . ” ​ — Psalm 19 : 7 , 10 , 11 .
Centuries later , Paul pointed out an even greater value of the Law .
It was his duty to protect the children and to escort them to school .
Thus , while Jehovah expressed his righteousness through the Law , he did so with the people’s welfare and eternal salvation in mind .
Those Counted Righteous by God
They failed to keep all God’s commandments because God’s Law was perfect but they were not .
Never may that become so ! ”
Rather , it means measuring up to one’s obligations before God and men .
He did just so . ” Zechariah and Elizabeth , the parents of John the Baptizer , “ were righteous before God because of walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah . ”
And a non - Israelite , an Italian army officer by the name of Cornelius , was described as “ a man righteous and fearing God . ” ​ — Acts 10 : 22 .
Furthermore , righteousness in humans is very much related to what is in one’s heart ​ — one’s faith in and appreciation and love for Jehovah and his promises — ​ and not just to one’s doing what God requires .
The Scriptures say that Abraham “ put faith in Jehovah ; and he proceeded to count it to him as righteousness . ”
Delight in Jehovah’s Righteousness
Then , one must continue to pursue righteousness , as well as other spiritual qualities .
Timothy , a baptized Christian with the heavenly calling , was admonished by Paul : “ Pursue righteousness , godly devotion , faith , love , endurance , mildness of temper . ”
This is because all of us are imperfect and our natural tendency is toward unrighteousness .
Moreover , we are surrounded by people who care little about Jehovah’s righteous ways .
Thus , each of us does well to ask : ‘ Do I give silent consent in my heart to the immoral practices we see around us ?
To the question : “ O Jehovah , who will be a guest in your tent ?
For details regarding the extensiveness of the Mosaic Law , see the article “ Some Features of the Law Covenant , ” on pages 214 - 20 in volume 2 of Insight on the Scriptures , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .

Cleansed as a People for Fine Works
How did Paul and James emphasize the importance of cleanness in true worship ?
This once again makes the point that to have a relationship with God and to receive his promised blessings , one must be clean and free from physical and spiritual defilement and corruption .
Clean for True Worship
Certain animals were unclean , and the Israelites were not to eat them .
Certain skin diseases , particularly leprosy , and discharges of the male and female organs would likewise cause a person to be unclean .
For what purpose were the laws on cleanness given ?
By faithfully keeping the Law , including all the requirements for remaining clean in Jehovah’s eyes , the Israelites would be fit to serve their God and to receive his blessing .
If Jehovah God , who says “ I have not changed , ” viewed being clean and undefiled as such an important factor in true worship back then , we today must take seriously the matter of being clean physically , morally , and spiritually if we want his approval and blessing . ​ — Malachi 3 : 6 ; Romans 15 : 4 ; 1 Corinthians 10 : 11 , 31 .
While physical cleanness alone does not make one a true worshiper of God , it is certainly fitting that a true worshiper be physically clean as far as his circumstances permit .
Especially today , when many people pay little attention to keeping themselves , their attire , or their surroundings clean , those who do are often noticed by people around them .
After a Witness convention at a stadium in São Paulo , Brazil , a stadium official told his cleaning crew supervisor : “ From now on we want the stadium cleaned the way Jehovah’s Witnesses did . ”
11 , 12 . ( a ) What Bible principle should we bear in mind when it comes to personal cleanness ?
All things are lawful ; but not all things build up . ”
We should , therefore , be certain that the appearance of our home and its surroundings does not detract from what we profess to be , namely , ministers of God’s Word .
Likewise , our personal appearance ​ — whether during leisure time or in the ministry — ​ can either enhance or diminish the appeal of the message we preach .
What a joy to have such young people in our midst !
Being busy with the ministry , meeting attendance , and personal study ​ — in addition to caring for other obligations in daily life — ​ does not excuse us from the need to remain clean and acceptable in the eyes of God and men .
To appreciate further the importance of moral and spiritual cleanness , consider what Jesus said when the Pharisees and scribes asserted that his disciples were unclean because they did not wash their hands before taking a meal .
Jesus set matters straight by stating : “ Not what enters into his mouth defiles a man ; but it is what proceeds out of his mouth that defiles a man . ”
Jesus then explained : “ The things proceeding out of the mouth come out of the heart , and those things defile a man .
What can we learn from Jesus ’ words ?
Today , in the name of free speech and artistic license , the entertainment and advertising industries are turning out an endless barrage of sounds and images that cater to the cravings of the fallen flesh .
It is certainly a blessing and a protection that , with Jehovah’s help , we can enjoy a clean standing before him .
As a cleansed people , for what works should we be zealous ?
How can we show that we are zealous for fine works ?
Our fine works also include manifesting the fruitage of God’s spirit in our everyday life , thus glorifying our heavenly Father .
All such services , rendered from a clean heart and with a pure motive , are well - pleasing to God . ​ — 1 Timothy 1 : 5 .
• Why were the Israelites given the many laws on cleanness ?
Finding the Truth in an Unlikely Place
IT IS God’s will that “ all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Osman was the second son in a family of nine children .
Growing up in a religious household , he regularly went to worship with his father .
Being fond of books , he picked it up , cleaned it , and noticed the title ​ — The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life .
Finally , Osman read that Jehovah will soon bring about an earthly paradise in which people will be able to live forever .
A few days later , with the help of some friends , Osman located the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses and attended a meeting for the first time .
How wonderful that all of this resulted from finding a Bible publication in a trash can !
Follow the Royal Pattern
What is that ?
What did Jehovah foresee regarding a human king , and what was such a king to do ?
Yes , the king that Jehovah would choose for his worshipers was to make a personal copy of writings that you can find in your Bible .
What do you think that would have entailed for David when he became king over Israel ?
Well , he would have had to make a copy of the books of the Pentateuch ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy ) .
Also , he would probably have had available the books of Joshua , Judges , and Ruth .
There he heard the Scriptures read and commented on .
You can easily get a sense of his familiarity with the Scriptures .
Some might be puzzled , however , by one passage that could be interpreted as though Jesus were discouraging the study of the Bible .
At John 5 : 39 , 40 , we read what Jesus said to some in his day : “ You are searching the Scriptures , because you think that by means of them you will have everlasting life ; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me . And yet you do not want to come to me that you may have life . ”
How different the picture was with Jesus ’ disciples , including the apostles !
The apostle Peter says that “ they kept on investigating , ” particularly about the Christ and what glories were involved in his saving role for mankind .
In his first letter , Peter 34 times quoted from ten Bible books . ​ — 1 Peter 1 : 10 , 11 .
And studying it was an undertaking for those who would rule with Christ as kings in heaven .
This royal pattern is just as necessary for all today who look forward to blessings on earth under Kingdom rule . ​ — Matthew 25 : 34 , 46 .
We can emphatically and honestly say that each true Christian should be making his or her own examination of the Bible .
That is not something needed merely when you first study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Yet , they did not keep up their studying and thus did not “ press on to maturity . ”
Why is an ongoing fondness for God’s Word important ?
A key to your having good study habits is that you develop a fondness for God’s Word .
( a ) How might more time be made available for Bible study ?
A step toward good study habits is regularly to set aside time for Bible study .
Whatever your honest response is , do you think that you would benefit from spending more time in personal study ?
14 , 15 . ( a ) Why are goals important when it comes to personal study ?
Goals .
Once you have the resulting satisfaction and benefits , your next goal might be a progressive reading of the books of Moses and the historical books through Esther .
Accomplishing that , you will see it is realistic to complete the rest of the Bible .
And rather than read from a computer screen or printout , she had the Bible in her hands .
One way is to include selected study material prior to reading each successive Bible book .
*
Some of them try to fix a distinct audience for each book or to conjure up an objective and supposed viewpoint that a human author of each book had in mind .
They get more involved in studying word origins and citing Hebrew and Greek meanings than in the import of God’s message .
The fact is that the books of God’s Word have permanent value for people of all ages and backgrounds .
Even if a book was initially addressed to one person , such as Timothy or Titus , or to a particular group , perhaps the Galatians or the Philippians , all of us can and should study those books .
Try to include these in upbuilding conversation with your family members or others .
*
Each time you read through a Bible book , you certainly will glean new information .
They gain spiritual gems and insights .
• You should approach a study of God’s Word with what frame of mind ?
“ If we want . . . a concordance to the Bible , we can find no better medium than the Internet .
What reasons do you have for wanting to study the Bible ?
The apostle Paul highlighted this when he urged Timothy : “ Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching .
Yes , your teaching involves salvation .
Teaching yourself and then others is authorized and directed by the highest Source , the Sovereign of the universe .
Christian teaching involves that the student learn personally to imitate God’s Son , Christ Jesus , and to teach others to do the same . ​ — John 15 : 10 .
Paul stressed this fact in a thought - provoking passage that had import for Jews back then but that carries a serious message for Christians today .
You , the one preaching ‘ Do not steal , ’ do you steal ?
You , who take pride in law , do you by your transgressing of the Law dishonor God ? ” ​ — Romans 2 : 21 - 23 .
They ‘ were orally instructed out of the Law and were persuaded that they were guides of the blind and a light for ones in darkness , teachers of babes . ’
That would dishonor both the Law and its Author in heaven .
Did some Jews literally do that ?
* So Paul might have been alluding to Jews who disregarded God’s command and used or profited from items originating in pagan temples .
He asked : “ Do you , however , the one teaching someone else , not teach yourself ? ”
The apostle did not here focus on Bible doctrines or history .
The teaching of oneself and of others to which Paul referred had to do with Christian morality .
Perhaps the Jews whom Paul mentioned were experienced in such subtle reasoning intended to rationalize or to mislead others .
Paul’s words show , though , that Christian morality is not to be minimized or ignored at personal discretion .
The apostle highlighted a prime reason for learning and then applying the morality that you find in the Bible .
Your being aware of this can strengthen your resolve if you face temptations or situations where ignoring Christian morality might seem the easiest or most convenient way to act .
Beyond being personally aware that your conduct reflects on God , as you teach others , help them to see that how they apply the moral standards that they are learning will reflect on Jehovah .
It also reflects on the One who provided and encourages that morality . ​ — Psalm 74 : 10 ; James 3 : 17 .
Morality affects other humans too .
You can see that from examples in God’s Word that illustrate the value of applying God’s moral standards and the results of disregarding them .
For instance , you might reflect on what Paul meant in saying that engaging in fornication can bring one “ to the point of harming and encroach upon the rights of his brother in this matter . ”
What rights are included , and how will a better understanding of this provide you with added incentive to maintain Christian morality ?
If you have access to it , you can use it to locate information in the Bible - based publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
You can search by subject or under a listing by Bible verse .
And how might those rights be encroached on ?
You can read such comments in Insight on the Scriptures , Volume 1 , pages 863 - 4 ; True Peace and Security ​ — How Can You Find It ? , page 145 ; The Watchtower , November 15 , 1989 , page 31 .
If she is single , he encroaches on her right to enter marriage as a virgin and her future husband’s right to expect her to be such .
If he is a member of a Christian congregation , he brings reproach on it , hurting its reputation . ​ — 1 Corinthians 5 : 1 .
And think how much more effective you can be as a teacher !
Why do you agree with what the apostle John wrote , as recorded at 1 John 5 : 3 ?
While the moral standards presented in God’s Word are clear and specific , they are not an oppressive burden .
On the contrary , it proved to be good , beneficial , a blessing .
And his commandments do not weigh us down . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 3 , New English Translation .
Jewish Antiquities , Book 18 , chapter 3 , paragraph 5 .
Do You Recall ?
• Why must we study to teach ourselves before teaching others ?
“ His commandments do not weigh us down ”
Religious Icons ​ — Their Ancient Roots
Not far from her , an exhausted old lady who has traveled from the other end of the country struggles to keep her tired feet going .
It is not uncommon for Orthodox Christians to say that when they worship an icon , they connect with the divine .
As a result , “ Christian artisans adapted [ an interfaith ] method and made use of pagan symbols , putting them within a new context , although not purifying them totally from pagan influence . ”
Soon icons became the focus of both private and public religious life .
A natural freedom of fancy among the people turned the holy relics , pictures , and statues into objects of adoration ; people prostrated themselves before them , kissed them , burned candles and incense before them , crowned them with flowers , and sought miracles from their occult influence . . . .
Today , many who use religious icons would similarly argue that images are merely objects of respect ​ — not worship .
They might claim that religious paintings are legitimate ​ — even indispensable — ​ aids in worshiping God .
Perhaps you feel the same way .
Can such practices actually pose hidden dangers ?
Usually , they are painted on portable wooden boards .
On another occasion , Jesus explained : “ The hour will come ​ — in fact it is here already — ​ when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth : that is the kind of worshipper the Father wants .
Regardless of how imposing an icon may be , it can never match the glory of God .
Would a person be ‘ worshiping in truth ’ if he approached God through some man - made icon ?
An Orthodox priest wrote : “ We pay respect to them because they are holy objects , and because we reverence what the Icons depict . ”
Nowhere does the Bible authorize such a practice .
The Hidden Danger
The Israelites also tried to use the ark of the covenant as a charm against their enemies , with disastrous results .
The tendency to worship things in place of God is still very much alive .
Researcher Vitalij Ivanovich Petrenko said : “ The icon . . . becomes the object of worship and in danger of idolatry . . .
The claim that icons are only aids to relative worship is highly questionable .
The Bible’s direct answer is : “ There is only one mediator between God and mankind , himself a man , Christ Jesus . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 2 : 5 .
How so ?
First and foremost , it can cause a breach in one’s relationship with Jehovah .
Rebuilding their relationship with God meant their ‘ spurning sinful idols . ’ ​ — Isaiah 31 : 6 , 7 , NAB .
Unless otherwise noted , all Scripture quotations are from the Catholic Jerusalem Bible .
She used most of her meager pension to purchase gold and silver icons , incense , and candles .
She kept these hidden in her bed and often slept in a nearby chair for fear that they might be seen or stolen .
Athena , from the island of Lesbos in Greece , was an extremely active member of the Orthodox Church .

Why did he utter those words ?
Darkness persisted .
Indeed , 57 years after the end of that war , the world is still in darkness .
The first words of Isaiah 60 are addressed to a woman in a very sad condition ​ — in darkness , lying prostrate on the ground .
The time has come for the woman to stand up and reflect God’s light , his glory .
What , though , do the symbols in these three introductory verses stand for ?
Who is the woman of Isaiah chapter 60 , and who represent her on earth ?
The woman of Isaiah 60 : 1 - 3 is Zion , Jehovah’s celestial organization of spirit creatures .
What was the condition of Zion in 1918 , and how had this been prophesied ?
Was there a time when “ the Israel of God ” was lying in darkness , as foreshadowed by that prophetic woman ?
What dramatic change occurred in 1919 , with what result ?
However , the year 1919 saw a dramatic change .
Jehovah shed light upon Zion !
Thanks to the reborn zeal of these Christians , others were drawn to Jehovah’s light .
Later , a great crowd of other sheep began to be drawn to Jehovah’s light .
( b ) What reason has Zion had for joy ?
He gives the woman another command .
The worldwide Kingdom proclamation that began in 1919 drew in thousands of new ones to Jehovah’s service .
We read : “ At that time you will see and certainly become radiant , and your heart will actually quiver and expand , because to you the wealthiness of the sea will direct itself ; the very resources of the nations will come to you . ”
In harmony with those prophetic words , since the 1930 ’ s , multitudes of Christians whose hope is to live on earth forever have flocked to Zion .
No , they add to the beauty of Zion by coming to worship in association with their anointed brothers , becoming “ one flock ” with them under “ one shepherd . ” ​ — John 10 : 16 .
Merchants , Shepherds , and Traders Come to Zion
Describe the crowds seen moving toward Zion .
All those from Sheba ​ — they will come . Gold and frankincense they will carry .
And the praises of Jehovah they will announce . ”
And these merchants come to God’s light in order to laud him publicly , ‘ to announce the praises of Jehovah . ’
Shepherds too are flocking to Zion .
The prophecy goes on to say : “ All the flocks of Kedar ​ — they will be collected together to you . The rams of Nebaioth ​ — they will minister to you . ”
It looks like a flock of birds skimming the waves .
In harmony with Paul’s words , genuine Christians are not satisfied with merely attending religious services once a week .
Who contributed to the rebuilding work in ancient times , and who have done so in modern times ?
Jehovah says : “ In my indignation I shall have struck you , but in my goodwill I shall certainly have mercy upon you . ”
Now is the time for Jehovah to express mercy to his anointed servants and their other sheep companions .
Some opposers try to close those “ gates , ” but we know that they cannot succeed .
The fleet of ships looks like doves on the horizon
When Jehovah’s people are faithful , he cares for them , makes them fruitful , and protects them .
Of course , in a world immersed in darkness , those who “ live with godly devotion ” will meet opposition .
Remember , though , that Jehovah has already determined the outcome of any opposition to the fulfilling of his will .
The truth is that during the last days of this system of things , Jehovah has blessed his people beyond their expectations .
Mountains covered with flourishing forests are a magnificent sight .
These terms refer to the courtyards of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple , which is the arrangement for approaching him in worship through Jesus Christ .
Isaiah himself had earlier seen crowds from all nations streaming to Jehovah’s elevated mountain of worship .
These stood “ before the throne of God . . . , rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple . ”
What great change for the better did the children of Zion experience ?
She did feel “ left entirely , ” for her children on earth did not clearly discern God’s will for them .
Moreover , is not the promise in this verse exhilarating ?
She will be “ an exultation , ” a cause for unbounded joy .
Listen , now , to another divine promise .
Freely given financial contributions help to make possible a great international preaching and teaching work .
Wise use of modern technology facilitates the publishing of Bibles and Bible literature in hundreds of languages .
We read at Isaiah 60 : 17 : “ Instead of the copper I shall bring in gold , and instead of the iron I shall bring in silver , and instead of the wood , copper , and instead of the stones , iron ; and I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners . ”
Consider a few examples .
8 - 10 .
However , in many congregations that arrangement did not work out so well because some elective elders did not fully support the evangelizing work .
That was like “ iron ” instead of “ stones ” or “ gold ” instead of “ copper . ”
None other than Jehovah God .
And he is the one who goes on to say : “ I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners . ”
And Jehovah’s Witnesses have been blessed in many ways as a result .
How beautiful those words are !
Their peaceful state , based on the love that true Christians have for one another , is a foretaste of new world living .
What a wonderful assurance that is for us who are living during the last days of this bedarkened world !
14 , 15 . ( a ) In what way are all of God’s people “ righteous ” ?
Isaiah 60 : 21 says : “ As for your people , all of them will be righteous ; to time indefinite they will hold possession of the land , the sprout of my planting , the work of my hands , for me to be beautified . ”
In a decidedly sinful world , they had been “ declared righteous ” on the basis of their unshakable faith in the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus .
Then , like the Israelites released from Babylonian captivity , they took possession of a “ land , ” a spiritual land , or realm of activity , wherein they would enjoy a spiritual paradise .
Their faith , their endurance , and their zeal will never cease to bring honor to God’s name .
All members of that spiritual nation have come into the new covenant .
When anointed Christians were restored to activity in 1919 , they were few in number ​ — truly , a “ little one . ”
The peaceful condition of God’s people , the spiritual paradise existing on their “ land , ” has attracted so many honesthearted ones that “ the small one ” has really become “ a mighty nation . ”
It astounds us that so far in advance , Jehovah foresaw the great increase in the numbers of true worshipers in our day .
• In what ways has Jehovah ‘ brought in copper instead of wood ’ ?
• What two qualities are highlighted at Isaiah 60 : 17 , 21 ?
The apostle Paul referred to this when he wrote : “ When I was a babe , I used to speak as a babe , to think as a babe , to reason as a babe ; but now that I have become a man , I have done away with the traits of a babe . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13 : 11 .
Christians need to progress from being spiritual babes to being those “ full - grown in powers of understanding . ”
They should reach out and seek to attain “ the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ . ”
( b ) What godly qualities should we display , and how important are they ?
Each quality that Peter lists is vital , and none can be omitted .
Why do we need endurance ?
Having endurance means more than just bearing up under hardship and remaining resolute .
What is godly devotion , and what does it impel us to do ?
Godly devotion is personal reverence , worship , and service to Jehovah God out of loyalty to his universal sovereignty .
To practice godly devotion with respect to Jehovah , we need accurate knowledge of him and his ways .
How do godly devotion and exclusive devotion work hand in hand ?
As our Creator , he has a right to our exclusive devotion .
Build a Relationship With God
Our desire to do this and to serve Jehovah faithfully therefore moves us to continue studying his Word and meditating on it .
As we allow God’s spirit to operate on our minds and hearts , our love for Jehovah deepens .
However , he helps us to draw close to him by giving us all the provisions we need to build and maintain godly devotion .
These are meaningful expressions of our godly devotion .
And we can maintain our joy in doing so , confident of God’s blessing . ​ — Proverbs 10 : 22 .
As Christians , we must be on guard so that any weakness involving fleshly desires and activities does not encroach on our godly devotion and destroy it .
Beware of Threats to Godly Devotion
What should we remember if we are enticed by the snare of materialism ?
Granted , some benefits are derived from bodily training and recreation .
Yet , such rewards are small compared with everlasting life .
Succumbing to these can prevent us from living up to God’s righteous requirements .
Strong measures are needed to wipe out wrong desires .
Especially can discouragement have a devastating effect on us if it is accompanied by resentment because we feel slighted or have been strongly chastised or disciplined .
In fact , “ he who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot be loving God , whom he has not seen . ”
He told his listeners : “ If , then , you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you , leave your gift there in front of the altar , and go away ; first make your peace with your brother , and then , when you have come back , offer up your gift . ”
Jesus also gave other counsel on handling difficulties .
Why is it so important to imitate Jesus ’ example ?
Remember that Jehovah can deliver us out of trial .
Closely scrutinizing Jesus ’ example and endeavoring to imitate him in word and deed will help us to cultivate godly devotion and display it in greater measure .
JEHOVAH’S only - begotten Son , Jesus Christ , left no doubt about worship that pleases his heavenly Father .
God is a Spirit , and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth . ”
How are we to understand those words ?
But what would this require of them ?
For our worship to be acceptable to Jehovah , it must also be rendered to him with truth .
It must conform to what God’s Word , the Bible , reveals about him and his purposes .
In fact , Swedish author Alf Ahlberg wrote : “ Many philosophical questions are of such a nature that it is not possible to give a definite answer to them . ”
Not according to Jesus Christ .
Jesus tells Pilate : “ For this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . ”
“ Truth ” has been defined as “ the body of real things , events , and facts . ”
How would you prove that Jehovah is the Source of truth ?
And Jehovah has lovingly taught or conveyed the truth in various ways .
In fact , Jesus spoke the truth as no other man ever had .
Even after his ascension to heaven , he revealed the truth from his Father .
The truth further became reality by Jesus ’ enlightening ministry as a Kingdom proclaimer .
Why could Jesus say , ‘ I am the truth ’ ?
Who really are teaching all nations the truth ?
They believe that “ all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching . ”
Moreover , they acknowledged that the human soul dies .
For instance , they must acknowledge the position and authority of the Father and of his Son , Jesus Christ .
Why would you say that baptism is for believers ?
23 , 24 .
Total immersion in water is the proper form of baptism for believers .
According to the French work Larousse du XXSiècle ( Paris , 1928 ) , “ the first Christians received baptism by immersion everywhere where water was found . ”
The foregoing points regarding the Bible - based beliefs and practices of the first Christians are merely examples .
[ Picture on page 16 ]
Jesus told Pilate : ‘ I have come to bear witness to the truth ’
In these and many other respects , there are parallels between the early Christians and Jehovah’s Witnesses .
6 , 7 .
Although they proclaim a peaceful message , how have true Christians been treated ?
Historian John L . von Mosheim called first - century Christians “ a set of men of the most harmless inoffensive character , who never harboured in their minds a wish or thought inimical to the welfare of the state . ” Dr .
Mosheim stated that what “ irritated the Romans against the Christians , was the simplicity of their worship , which resembled in nothing the sacred rites of any other people . ”
He added : “ They had no sacrifices , temples , images , oracles , or sacerdotal orders ; and this was sufficient to bring upon them the reproaches of an ignorant multitude , who imagined that there could be no religion without these .
Thus they were looked upon as a sort of atheists ; and , by the Roman laws , those who were chargeable with atheism were declared the pests of human society . ”
“ No one knows the exact date of Christ’s birth , ” admits The World Book Encyclopedia .
Why have past and present servants of Jehovah avoided Easter celebrations ?
Easter supposedly commemorates the resurrection of Christ , but reputable sources link it with false worship .
In any case , the Encyclopædia Britannica ( 11th Edition ) states : “ There is no indication of the observance of the Easter festival in the New Testament . ”
What observance did Jesus institute , and who have kept it properly ?
The Truth and Personal Conduct
W .
Killen , professor of ecclesiastical history , wrote : “ In the second and third centuries the playhouse in every large town was a centre of attraction ; and whilst the actors were generally persons of very loose morals , their dramatic performances were perpetually pandering to the depraved appetites of the age . . . .
If there is a conflict between a human demand and the divine will , they take the stand : “ We must obey God as ruler rather than men . ”
Early Christians were advocates of God’s Kingdom , even as the patriarchs Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob exercised faith in that promised ‘ city made by God . ’
Noting an interesting parallel , lecturer in church history Geoffrey F .
“ It takes a bigoted and paranoid imagination to believe that the Jehovah’s Witnesses pose any kind of threat to any political regime , ” wrote a North American editorialist .
Enlightened authorities know that they have nothing to fear from Witnesses of Jehovah .
Writing to Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius ( 138 - 161 C.E . ) , Justin Martyr held that Christians paid their taxes “ more readily than all men . ”
( Apology , chapter 42 ) Christians benefited from the Pax Romana , or Roman Peace , with its law and order , good roads , and relatively safe maritime travel .
20 , 21 .
If all the people in the world at least tried to live according to the Bible the way Jehovah’s Witnesses do , our cruel world would be absolutely different . ”
When the chief security officer of the Pretoria Show Grounds in South Africa saw how Witnesses of all races met there peaceably as convention delegates , he said : “ Everyone was and is courteous , people speaking nicely to one another , the attitude displayed the past few days ​ — it all testifies to the calibre of the members of your society , and that all live together like one happy family . ”
• In manner of worship , what similarity is there between the early Christians and Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
[ Picture on page 21 ]
Jesus commanded his followers to observe the Memorial of his sacrificial death
[ Picture on page 24 ]
Cleveland used to pray three times a day , asking God to help him find the correct way to worship Him .
Cleveland was convinced that his parents did not worship in the right way , but after examining other religions , he became disillusioned .
Though he had heard about Jehovah’s Witnesses , he questioned whether they had the truth .
Why ?
Soon Cleveland learned that the immoral relationships he was having with two different women were displeasing to God .
As a result , two of his former teammates began attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
[ Map / Picture on page 8 ]
What question arises regarding the way Israel was organized , and why is the answer of importance to us ?
That certainly was the case with Israel .
We do well to consider the way Jehovah governed that ancient nation , noting in particular how his dealings with Israel highlight the importance of loyally submitting to godly authority .
There were chieftains , heads of paternal houses , and older men to serve the people as counselors and judges .
However , we must not conclude that without divine guidance those responsible men could somehow judge matters with flawless discernment and understanding .
Moses told them : “ You must not be partial in judgment . You should hear the little one the same as the great one . You must not become frightened because of a man , for the judgment belongs to God . ”
( b ) What lesson can we draw from the fact that the Levites performed a variety of tasks ?
Caring for the spiritual needs of several million people was an enormous task , and the priests were relatively few in number .
Jehovah told Moses : “ You must give the Levites to Aaron and his sons . They are given ones , given to him from the sons of Israel . ” ​ — Numbers 3 : 9 , 39 .
However , every Levite , whether a Kohathite or not , enjoyed marvelous privileges .
Rather than loyally submitting to godly authority , they became dissatisfied and gave in to pride , ambition , and jealousy .
( a ) Who was Korah ?
Nevertheless , he was a respected chieftain in Israel .
Worshiping that calf caused our people to fall into idolatry .
That led to his rebellion against Moses and Aaron and , ultimately , against Jehovah . ​ — 1 Samuel 15 : 23 ; James 1 : 14 , 15 .
9 , 10 .
The rebels should have known better than to challenge Moses ’ authority .
Not long before , Aaron and Miriam had done just that .
Is it not by us also that he has spoken ? ”
What more could they desire ?
Now , with an open rebellion afoot , it was time for Israel’s Judge and Statute - giver to intervene !
According to God’s Law , only the priests could offer incense .
The record tells us : “ Jehovah now spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying : ‘ Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly , that I may exterminate them in an instant . ’ ”
Finally , Jehovah’s patience came to an end .
( b ) What has this account taught you about Jehovah ?
Who demanded that the Israelites be set free ?
Today , there is a new “ nation ” that has Jehovah as its invisible Judge , its Statute - giver , and its King .
Who was Jehovah going to use to lead this new “ nation ” ?
The apostle Peter answers that question in his first inspired letter .
These older men meet the requirements that are set out in God’s Word , which is a product of God’s spirit .
Hence , their appointment can be said to be by holy spirit .
What do you appreciate about hardworking elders ?
Rather than challenge their authority , we truly appreciate our hardworking elders !
They faithfully prepare for and conduct congregation meetings , work side by side with us in preaching the “ good news of the Kingdom , ” and provide Scriptural advice when we need it .
Of what must the elders be conscious , and why ?
Mindful of their limitations , they do not try to lord it over the flock , “ God’s inheritance . ”
Rather , they consider themselves ‘ fellow workers for the joy of their brothers . ’
Humble , hardworking elders love Jehovah , and they know that the closer they come to imitating him , the more good they will be able to do in the congregation .

• How can we show that we appreciate Jehovah’s arrangements today ?
[ Picture on page 13 ]
“ We hear them speaking in our tongues about the magnificent things of God . ” ​ — Acts 2 : 11 .
“ Suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze , and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting .
One of those Galileans was the apostle Peter .
He explained that a few weeks earlier , Jesus Christ had been murdered by unrighteous men .
And how can this account help us to evaluate our own service to Jehovah ?
Having received the holy spirit , the disciples in Jerusalem lost no time in sharing the good news of salvation with others , beginning with the crowd who had gathered that morning .
Did this mean that God was going to raise up a whole generation of prophets , both male and female , in the manner of David , Joel , and Deborah , and use them to foretell future events ?
So they would serve as spokesmen for the Most High .
They “ embraced his word heartily ” and “ were baptized , and on that day about three thousand souls were added . ”
As natural Jews and Jewish proselytes , they already had a basic knowledge of the Scriptures .
Indeed , “ day after day they were in constant attendance at the temple with one accord , . . . praising God and finding favor with all the people . ”
No doubt this increase was , at least in part , due to their zealous efforts to preach the “ good news ” when they returned home . ​ — Colossians 1 : 23 .
They learn of Jehovah’s kind provision of the ransom through Jesus Christ , whose shed blood can cleanse them from all sin .
Love for the Source of these “ magnificent things ” wells up in them , and they are moved to preach these precious truths .
Such knowledge stirs their heart , changes their way of thinking , and becomes part of them .
However , one thing was indelibly impressed upon Martha’s mind , as we shall see .
One day , Martha saw Camille weeping because of distress over some personal problems .
At the first opportunity , she walked into a Kingdom Hall , wearing the dress and shoes that Martha had given her , and asked for a Bible study .
Stirred to Reflect Jehovah’s Standards
Like the first - century Christians , they are deeply moved by “ the magnificent things of God . ”
“ I desire the women to adorn themselves in well - arranged dress , with modesty and soundness of mind , not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb , but in the way that befits women professing to reverence God , namely , through good works . ”
Virtually anyone , even those of modest means , can meet such reasonable standards by ensuring that their clothing is neat , clean , and presentable .
So when the conventioners arrive in the area where the convention is to be held , their appearance is often somewhat disheveled .
( a ) What does it mean to dress with “ modesty and soundness of mind ” ?
( b ) What is involved for us to dress ‘ as people who profess to reverence God ’ ?
In an age where peer pressure has never been more intense , we must not allow the world to dictate our dress .
Even the dress code of business and professional people does not always provide a reliable standard of what is appropriate for Christians .
This is a further reason why we should always be conscious of the need to “ quit being fashioned after this system of things ” if we are to live according to God’s standards and thus “ adorn the teaching of our Savior , God , in all things . ” ​ — Romans 12 : 2 ; Titus 2 : 10 .
If it is a dress or a skirt , what about the length ?
Because the Bible says : “ Even the Christ did not please himself . ”
What motivates you to give careful attention to your dress and grooming ?
Really , how privileged we are to have learned the truth !
Because we exercise faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ , our sins are forgiven .
We do not fear death as do those who have no hope .
Rather , we have Jesus ’ assurance that one day “ all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”

Although Paul’s words were addressed to Christian women , the same principles apply to Christian men and young people .

A Lesson From the Stork
“ EVEN the stork in the heavens ​ — it well knows its appointed times . . .
Both male and female birds share in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks .
To many people today , loyalty and faithfulness are quaint ideas ​ — admirable but not practical .
“ I Set the Pattern for You ”
And we know that our teaching can even make a life - or - death difference to those whom we teach !
Naturally , then , we may ask ourselves : ‘ Am I really the teacher I ought to be ?
The foundation of good teaching , though , is not technique but something far more important .
A Long - Standing Love of Divine Truths
Then , at the time of his baptism , he went through a unique experience .
Thereafter he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness .
What a contrast we find between these two sons of God !
Yes , Jesus loved all the truths that Jehovah had taught him .
He loved divine truths far too much to replace them with his own thinking .
He loved the principles that Jehovah taught by means of that passage .
That often happens in the case of human teachers .
Remember , though , that Jesus was wise in a godly way .
How did Jesus show that he did not want his followers to feel intimidated by him ?
Why ?
He did not merely say , “ Be healed . ”
Consider what happened when he met Nathanael , who later became an apostle .
He had his faults , as do all of us .
In fact , when he heard about Jesus , he made a rather blunt remark : “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ”
An army officer of those days would likely have a past littered with many acts of violence , bloodshed , and false worship .
Jesus fully lived up to those words .
Though perfect , Jesus was human , subject to fatigue and hunger .
Even when he was tired or was in need of rest or quiet time to pray , however , he put the needs of others ahead of his own . ​ — Mark 1 : 35 - 39 .
What teaching method set Jesus apart from the Pharisees , and why was the method effective ?
Jesus served his disciples by humbly setting the pattern for them .
His love for what he taught and his love for the people he taught were evident to all honesthearted ones who saw and heard him .
• What is the foundation of good teaching , as exemplified by whom ?
• How did Jesus show love for the people he taught ?
And love is something that all of us can cultivate .
Why do some find it difficult to study , but what exhortation is found at Proverbs 2 : 1 - 5 ?
To love the truths that we teach others , we must love learning such truths ourselves .
It is essential , however , that we learn from Jehovah .
Proverbs 2 : 1 - 5 says : “ My son , if you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself , so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear , that you may incline your heart to discernment ; if , moreover , you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself , if you keep seeking for it as for silver , and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it , in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah , and you will find the very knowledge of God . ”
What , though , is to motivate us to do all of this ?
And what can make us receptive and eager to learn what Jehovah teaches us ?
Our viewpoint .
( b ) Why should we keep adding to the treasures of knowledge we have found in the Bible ?
Over time , has appreciation for your treasure become faded or tarnished ?
God’s Word is full of gems and nuggets of truth .
No matter how many you have found , you can find more .
What are some ways in which we can show others that we love the truths we have learned from the Bible ?
Give an example .
9 , 10 .
Following Jesus ’ example , we do not simply base our answers on our own ideas .
Do what you can to be prepared .
It might be better to say , “ God’s Word , the Bible , forbids it ” or , “ It would displease my God . ”
What research tool may help us to be ready to answer questions about the truths of God’s Word ?
* Pick out a few subjects that seem likely to arise , and commit some Scriptural points to memory .
So when asked a Bible question that you cannot answer , you can always reply to this effect : “ Thank you for raising such an interesting question .
That judgment lies in the future and belongs to the one Jehovah has appointed , Jesus Christ .
If they seem apathetic toward the message we bring them , do I seek to understand why they feel as they do ?
When people sense our genuine empathy , they are more likely to respond to our message .
Why is it important to remain mild and respectful toward those to whom we preach ?
Jesus had great knowledge , yet he was never overbearing .
The Great Educator , Jehovah , qualifies us for the ministry .
So by persisting in the work , never giving up , we are faithfully serving the sheeplike ones we have yet to reach .
As they observe our conduct and our dealings with our neighbors , schoolmates , and workmates , can they see that we are happy and fulfilled ?
Similarly , we teach Bible students that the Christian congregation is an oasis of love in a cold , fierce world .

We show love for people by sharing the good news with them
The chief priests and Pharisees demanded an explanation : “ Why is it you did not bring him in ? ”
* ​ — John 7 : 32 , 45 , 46 .
The people in his hometown marveled “ at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth . ”
But Jesus also had an extraordinary grasp of teaching methods .
In the study articles appearing in this issue , we will discuss some of the effective methods he used and how we can imitate them .
To reach them , he used language that such people could understand .
Often using clear , short phrases , Jesus uttered sayings that were simple but rich in meaning .
He often did so even when it would have been less time - consuming just to tell his listeners the point .
* Peter , impulsive at times , answered , “ Yes . ”
When he said : ‘ From the strangers , ’ Jesus said to him : ‘ Really , then , the sons are tax - free . ’ ”
Why is that ?
The second example involved an incident that took place on Passover night 33 C.E . when a mob came to arrest Jesus .
How did Jesus respond ?
Yet , he took the time right then and there to impress important truths on Peter’s mind by questions .
Is it not obvious that Jesus appreciated the value of questions ?
With hyperbole , Jesus created mental pictures that were hard to forget .
Let us consider a few examples .
Can you visualize the scene ?
But the critic’s own ability to judge is impaired by a “ rafter ” ​ — a log or beam that might be used to support a roof .
Yet , they figuratively gulped down the camel , which was also unclean .
What are some lessons that Jesus taught by using hyperbole ?
A huge camel trying to squeeze through the eye of a sewing needle ​ — how well that illustrates the difficulty facing a rich person who tries to serve God while holding on to a materialistic life - style !
With his perfect mind , Jesus was a master at reasoning logically with people .
At times , he used powerful logic to refute the false charges of his religious opposers .
Upon hearing about it , the Pharisees said : “ This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Beelzebub [ Satan ] , the ruler of the demons . ”
However , to keep the people from believing in Jesus , they attributed his power to Satan .
Powerful logic , was it not ?
He was aware that some from the Pharisees ’ own ranks had cast out demons .
A number of times , he used what might be called a ‘ how much more so ’ line of reasoning , helping his listeners to advance from a familiar truth to further conviction .
Then he concluded : “ If you , although being wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him ! ”
If an unwilling friend could finally be persuaded to meet his neighbor’s need , and if imperfect human parents care for the needs of their children , how much more will our loving heavenly Father grant holy spirit to his loyal servants who humbly come to him in prayer !
( b ) After reviewing a few of Jesus ’ teaching methods , what conclusion do we reach ?
And what made his illustrations so effective ?
The officers were likely agents of the Sanhedrin and under the authority of the chief priests .
This last excerpt , found at Acts 20 : 35 , is quoted only by the apostle Paul , although the sense of those words is found in the Gospels .
• What is hyperbole , and how did Jesus use this teaching method ?
Jesus used plain language that ordinary people could understand
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why are effective illustrations not easily forgotten ?
One author noted that illustrations “ turn ears into eyes and free listeners to think with pictures in their heads . ”
Surely Jehovah must value this method of teaching !
Let us now examine some of the factors that made his illustrations so effective .
Privileged though they were to hear the voice of Jesus , they did not yet have the advantage of consulting a written record to remind them of the things he said .
Instead , they had to carry Jesus ’ words in their minds and hearts .
Through his skillful use of illustrations , Jesus made it easier for them to remember what he taught .
In what way ?
Jesus was selective in his use of details .
For example , in the parable of the unmerciful slave , no explanation was given as to how that slave had managed to run up a debt of 60,000,000 denarii .
What mattered was , not how the slave fell into debt , but how his debt was forgiven and how he , in turn , treated a fellow slave who owed him relatively little money .
Similarly , in the illustration of the prodigal son , Jesus offered no explanation as to why the younger son suddenly demanded his inheritance and why he squandered it .
Hence , rather than describing what the neighborly Samaritan looked like , Jesus related something far more significant ​ — how the Samaritan compassionately came to the aid of an injured Jew lying on the road .
Think , for a moment , about his early life .
How often did he observe children playing in the marketplace ?
Jesus likely took note of other commonplace things that found their way into his illustrations ​ — seeds being sown , joyful marriage feasts , and grain fields ripening in the sun . ​ — Matthew 13 : 3 - 8 ; 25 : 1 - 12 ; Mark 4 : 26 - 29 .
In the parable of the neighborly Samaritan , why is it significant that Jesus used the road that went “ from Jerusalem to Jericho ” to make his point ?
Jesus began by saying : “ A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers , who both stripped him and inflicted blows , and went off , leaving him half - dead . ”
When relating this parable , he was in Judea , not far from Jerusalem ; so his listeners likely knew about the road in question .
It wound through lonely terrain , providing many lurking places for robbers .
The priests served at the temple in Jerusalem , and the Levites assisted them .
Let us see how he put this knowledge to skillful use in his teaching .
On one occasion , Jesus used a recent event to reject the false notion that tragedy befalls those who deserve it .
He said : “ Those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , thereby killing them , do you imagine that they were proved greater debtors [ sinners ] than all other men inhabiting Jerusalem ? ”
Jesus knew just the right account to use , and his Jewish listeners no doubt were familiar with it . ​ — Matthew 12 : 1 - 8 .
We cannot help but marvel at his matchless ability to convey important truths in a way that reached his listeners .
How , though , can we imitate him in our teaching ?
Jesus ’ illustrations took many forms , including examples , comparisons , similes , and metaphors .
Therefore , when traveling “ from Jerusalem to Jericho , ” as mentioned in the parable , a traveler would be “ going down . ”
• Why did Jesus teach with illustrations ?
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
Jesus told of a slave who refused to forgive a relatively small debt and of a father who forgave a son who had squandered his whole inheritance

Still , regardless of our abilities , we can do our best to imitate the way Jesus taught .
The basic truths of God’s Word are not complicated .
When you conduct a home Bible study or make return visits on interested ones , how can you teach with simplicity ?
To reach his listeners , many of whom were “ unlettered and ordinary , ” Jesus used plain language that they could grasp .
Jesus ’ example shows that simple words carefully chosen can convey the truth with much power .
* Nor is it necessary to rush through the information , as if covering a set amount of material is the most important thing .
Rather , it is wise to let the student’s needs and abilities determine the pace of the study .
Thus , the truth may touch his heart and move him to action . ​ — Romans 12 : 2 .
How can we choose a question that is tailored to a householder’s interest ?
Recall that Jesus was a master at using questions to get his disciples to express what was on their minds and to stimulate and train their thinking .
When approaching a house , look at the surroundings .
We could ask : ‘ Do you think the time will ever come when people like you and me can feel safe in our home and on the street ? ’
For example , suppose we are studying the chapter “ Why Living a Godly Life Brings Happiness , ” in the Knowledge book .
We would not want to ask questions that embarrass or humiliate the Bible student . ​ — Proverbs 12 : 18 .
Jesus occasionally used such questions .
Then , in the conclusion , he could refer to those questions to review the main points .
To be sure that the discouraged one sees how this applies to him personally , the elder might ask : ‘ Jehovah is near to whom ?
The Bible’s simple argument puts it best : “ Of course , every house is constructed by someone , but he that constructed all things is God . ”
Particularly effective is the ‘ how much more so ’ line of reasoning that Jesus occasionally used .
Based on contrast , this type of reasoning can make a deep impression .
How much more so must the very idea of hellfire be repugnant to our loving heavenly Father ! ’
Why are illustrations valuable in teaching ?
Let us consider how we can make use of this teaching method .
That in itself is a vivid figure of speech , but what concrete example can we use to illustrate the point ​ — an eraser ?
It is difficult to miss the point of such a simple illustration .
* Take , for example , the illustration used in paragraph 11 of chapter 17 in the Knowledge book .
It compares the diversity of personalities in the congregation to the variety of vehicles traveling alongside you on the road .
We may use published illustrations in our teaching , perhaps adapting them to the needs of a Bible student or adjusting them for use in a talk .
The rewards of being an effective teacher are great .
When we teach , we share with others ; we give part of ourselves to help them .

True Christians are teachers of God’s Word
Elders can use questions to help fellow believers to draw comfort from God’s Word
That statistic reminds us of Jesus ’ words in the Sermon on the Mount : “ If you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . ”
Yes , God’s forgiveness of our sins is conditional , in part , on our readiness to forgive others .
“ It is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us , that we may never drift away . ” ​ — HEBREWS 2 : 1 .
In all these situations , distraction can lead to disaster .
Paul emphasized that the resurrected Jesus Christ was given a position superior to all the angels , for he was seated at God’s right hand .
In the absence of their Master , some Hebrew Christians were starting to drift away from the true faith .
People could see the priests and smell the burning sacrifices .
Unlike physical circumcision under the Law , Christian circumcision was “ that of the heart by spirit . ”
How did Paul show that the system of worship instituted by Jesus was superior to that under the Law ?
He had foretold that Jerusalem would be destroyed .
Rather , he gave this instruction : “ When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies , then know that the desolating of her has drawn near .
The Bible serves as ‘ a light to our roadway ’ when it tells us God’s purposes for the future .
That is why it is vital that we “ pay more than the usual attention ” when we gather for instruction with fellow believers and when we personally read God’s Word .
Why is paying attention at Christian meetings challenging at times ?
If we are eager to take in the knowledge of God , we will benefit from meetings , regardless of a speaker’s abilities .
It is beneficial to make a schedule and choose a setting most conducive to study .
Some set aside a brief period in the morning when there may be less distraction .
Others find that the evening affords a better opportunity .
The point is that we must not ignore the vital need to take in accurate knowledge of God and his Son .
What is meditation , and how can it benefit us ?
It helps us to get God’s thoughts off the printed page and into our heart .
To benefit fully from study and meditation , we must keep the mind clear of distractions .
Doing this takes time and solitude , yet , how refreshing it is to partake of the spiritual food and the waters of truth found in God’s Word !
( a ) With regard to personal study , what has helped some to increase their attention span ?
Our goal should be to linger in study rather than to rush through it .
We need to cultivate an avid interest in the subject under consideration .
If so , it was only some five years later that Jerusalem was surrounded by the encamped armies of Cestius Gallus .

Keep Practicing the Things You Have Learned
“ The things that you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me , practice these ; and the God of peace will be with you . ” ​ — PHILIPPIANS 4 : 9 .
1 , 2 .
This headline in the newsletter Emerging Trends summarized the results of a nationwide poll in the United States .
( b ) How do Jesus ’ followers apply Paul’s counsel recorded at Philippians 4 : 9 ?
With genuine Christians , however , the situation is different .
Christians do more than accept the truth of God’s Word .
To please God , of course , they would need to keep holding to that pattern of truth by practicing what they have learned .
By carefully studying the inspired writings and applying them in life .
* False stories may also have included sensational and speculative rumors .
Higher critics ridicule the Bible’s claim to divine inspiration .
What is one way to test and see if we are in the faith ?
Even if we experience some trial in the congregation , why should we quit serving God ?
Our own disposition will change for the better when we apply Bible principles .
( a ) How did one young person muster up courage to witness at school ?
How Jehovah must rejoice when young ones who practice what they have learned muster up courage to witness at school ! ​ — Proverbs 27 : 11 ; Hebrews 6 : 10 .
How has the Theocratic Ministry School benefited one young Witness ?
Another example is that of Elizabeth .
Beginning at age seven and throughout her years in elementary school , this young girl invited her teachers to the Kingdom Hall whenever she had an assignment in the Theocratic Ministry School .
If a teacher could not attend , Elizabeth stayed after school and presented the talk to the teacher .
“ They could have cleaned me out for $ 9,000 ! ”
he said .
He had been disappointed on another occasion when his hat was stolen in church .
Regularly assemble with worshipers of Jehovah , and pay attention to the material presented at Christian meetings .

Tobit , possibly written in the third century B.C.E . , includes the superstition - filled tale of a Jew named Tobias .
• What “ false stories ” do we need to reject ?
The world is awash with war , acts of terror , suffering , crime , and disease ​ — evils that may soon affect us directly if they have not already .
How God Views Wickedness
Quite rightly we may turn to God for comfort , since he is good and compassionate and has the power and will to eliminate evil from the earth .
It is noteworthy that Paul also said to the people of Lystra : “ In the past generations [ God ] permitted all the nations to go on in their ways . ”
Will he ever do anything about it ?

Comfort in the Accurate Knowledge of God
FOR some people , what the Bible says about God’s love and mercy raises troubling questions .
Several days after the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York , a prominent religious leader in the United States said : “ I have been asked . . . hundreds of times in my life why God allows tragedy and suffering .
I have to confess that I really do not know the answer totally , even to my own satisfaction . ”
He also endorsed the view of a scholar who wrote : “ The incomprehensibility of suffering is part of the incomprehensibility of God . ”
In contrast with what religious leaders may say , the Bible does not portray God’s permission of evil as incomprehensible .
His rebellion manifested itself on earth when he influenced the first human couple to join him in his opposition to God .
Instead of submitting to God’s clear instruction not to eat or touch the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , Adam and Eve took some and ate it .
Did the Creator have the right to require full obedience from humankind ?
Might people be better off if they acted independently ?
He could have used his power to crush the rebellion immediately .
Yet , this too would fail to address Satan’s claim that humans would be better off ruling themselves .
Even though this has meant permitting evil to remain temporarily , humans have thus had the opportunity to show whether they can successfully rule themselves independent of God , living by their own standards of what is right and wrong .
The ultimate failure of the rebellion against Jehovah will settle the issues raised in Eden once and for all time .
Note what a wonderful glimpse of things to come was given to the apostle John in a vision .
He wrote : “ I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away , and the sea is no more . . . .
In a statement that emphasizes the trustworthiness of these promises , John was told : “ Write , because these words are faithful and true . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 1 - 5 .
Jehovah promised that he will bring back to life people now sleeping in death .
This truly is news ​ — not the kind we see on television or read in the newspaper but good news .

Medal of Recognition for a Kingdom Hall
The Finnish Association of Landscape Industries also issued a press release , which states : “ In various parts of the country , the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s Witnesses are , almost without exception , beautifully planned .
What makes these places truly beautiful , however , is that they are centers of true worship and Bible education .
For more than six million Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world , a Kingdom Hall ​ — well - appointed or modest — ​ is a well - loved place .
Jehovah Blesses and Protects Those Who Are Obedient
1 , 2 .
Her chicks run to her , and in seconds they are safely concealed beneath her pinions .
When the nation of Israel was obedient to Jehovah , it regularly benefited from his watchful care .
In that year Roman armies , holding high their standards emblazoned with the image of the eagle , swooped down upon Jerusalem to inflict a terrible slaughter .
Despite his insistence on obedience , Jehovah is well aware of the limitations of imperfect humans .
One of these was King Jehoash of ancient Judah .
When Jehoash reached seven years of age , High Priest Jehoiada courageously took him out of hiding and made him king .
Because God - fearing Jehoiada acted as father and adviser to Jehoash , the young ruler “ kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 22 : 10 – 23 : 1 , 11 ; 24 : 1 , 2 .
A military force of Syrians ​ — just “ a small number of men ” — ​ invaded Judah and “ brought all the princes of the people to ruin . ”
The invaders also forced the king to give over his own possessions as well as the gold and silver of the sanctuary .
A Secretary Saved by Obedience
Why ?
Observing this shift in Baruch’s attitude , Jehovah gave him clear but kind counsel , saying : “ You keep seeking great things for yourself .
So if we ‘ take some false step before we are aware of it ’ and receive needed counsel from God’s Word , let us imitate Baruch’s maturity , spiritual discernment , and humility . ​ — Galatians 6 : 1 .
Why is it good for us to be obedient to those who are taking the lead among us ?
Such a humble attitude on our part also helps those giving the counsel .
Says Hebrews 13 : 17 : “ Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive , for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account ; that they may do this with joy and not with sighing , for this would be damaging to you . ”
In fact , he even read the same message out to the princes of Jerusalem , which no doubt took considerable courage .
When the city fell to the Babylonians some 18 years later , imagine how grateful Baruch must have been for being spared because he had heeded Jehovah’s warning and stopped seeking “ great things ” for himself ! ​ — Jeremiah 39 : 1 , 2 , 11 , 12 ; 43 : 6 .
How did Jehovah show compassion for the Jews in Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege in 607 B.C.E . ?
Yet , he did not cower , but he obediently spoke Jehovah’s pronouncements .
Like Jeremiah , we too bear an unpopular message .
Soon , Satan’s entire wicked system will be destroyed in an unprecedented “ great tribulation . ”
Outnumbered and unarmed , God’s people will look to the refuge of Jehovah’s “ pinions , ” which he extends to shield the obedient .
Strong faith , in turn , fortifies us to obey Jehovah , even when his requirements seem to go contrary to human reasoning .
Those who make obedience to Jehovah their way of life experience even now the fulfillment of Proverbs 1 : 33 , which says : “ As for the one listening [ obediently ] to me , he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity . ”
Another reason for confidence is that “ the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets . ”
Though often portrayed as timid , “ a mother hen will fight to the death to protect her chicks from harm , ” says one humane society publication .
Whether they surrendered in response to Jeremiah’s words , we are not told .
• Why do Jehovah’s obedient people have no cause for fear as the present system nears its end ?
Under Jehoiada’s guidance , young Jehoash was obedient to Jehovah
Would you have obeyed Jehovah and witnessed his awesome saving power ?
Cultivate Obedience as the End Draws Near
The throne of the kings of Israel was even called Jehovah’s throne .
Jehovah confirmed the identity of this “ seed ” in 29 C.E . when he anointed Jesus of Nazareth with holy spirit . ​ — Luke 3 : 21 - 23 , 34 ; Galatians 3 : 16 .
Jesus ’ First Kingdom
When Jesus ascended to heaven , he did not immediately take up the scepter of rulership over the peoples of the world .
However , he did receive a “ kingdom ” with subjects that obeyed him .
As a group , they constituted a “ faithful and discreet slave , ” or a faithful steward class . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 ; Luke 12 : 42 .
Jehovah has always provided teachers for his people .
6 , 7 .
How has the slave class provided timely spiritual food through its Governing Body , and why is submission to the slave class fitting ?
Such subjection has taken on additional significance in modern times because of Jesus ’ enlarged authority , as foretold in Jacob’s deathbed prophecy .
The fulfillment of what Bible prophecies guarantees the failure of Satan’s warfare against true Christians ?
11 , 12 . ( a ) Who only will survive the end of the present system of things ?
Likewise today , God’s spirit ​ — the most powerful force in the universe — ​ is helping millions to become obedient to Jehovah , with the result that they can have “ the full assurance of the hope down to the end . ” ​ — Hebrews 6 : 11 ; Zechariah 4 : 6 .
Keep in mind , too , that we have the powerful backing of Shiloh , who along with his Father will let no enemy ​ — demon or human — ​ test our obedience beyond what we can bear .
In fact , to aid us in our spiritual warfare , Jesus described a number of specific problems that we would face during these last days .
To be sure , they contained vital counsel for Christians back then , but their main application is to “ the Lord’s day , ” since 1914 .
Avoid Apathy , Immorality , Materialism
Why must we guard against the problem that affected the congregation at Ephesus , and how can we do so ?
How can such love be reinvigorated ?
By regular Bible study , meeting attendance , prayer , and meditation .
Yes , for immorality is by far the leading cause for disfellowshipping among God’s people .
How did the view and attitude of those in Sardis and Laodicea compare with Jesus ’ view of their spiritual condition ?
How important that such ones obey Christ by investing in spiritual riches ​ — yes , “ buy from [ Christ ] gold refined by fire ” !
To those in Smyrna , he said : “ I know your tribulation and poverty ​ — but you are rich . ”
What a contrast to those in Laodicea , who boasted of worldly wealth but who were actually impoverished ! Of course , the Devil was not pleased to see anyone showing faithfulness and obedience to Christ .
Prove yourself faithful even to death , and I will give you the crown of life . ”
How have millions today kept Jesus ’ word , and despite what circumstances ?
( b ) How can we show that we truly want to obey Shiloh ?
For a detailed discussion of all seven letters , please see the book Revelation ​ — Its Grand Climax At Hand ! , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses , beginning on page 33 .
• In what ways can we imitate those in the congregations in ancient Smyrna and Philadelphia ?
Jehovah blesses his people for obeying the faithful “ steward ”
The influence of Satan makes obedience to God a challenge

A strong relationship with Jehovah helps us to be obedient to him
Jesus Christ corrected them , calling for a revival of their Christian zeal . ​ — Revelation 3 : 14 - 19 .
Easygoing complacency was also characteristic of the people in Noah’s day .
Would You Welcome a Visit ?
What can be said of the present world , and why do the anointed and their companions need to be vigilant ?
Satan is leading men astray “ with every powerful work and lying signs and portents and with every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing . ”
In these “ last days , ” however , Satan is concentrating his efforts on God’s dedicated servants , waging war with anointed Christians , “ who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus . ”
Satan is a deceiver through and through .
Using a serpent as a cover , he tricked Eve into thinking that she could find greater happiness by acting independently of God .
Just as he seduced Eve , he can cause Christians to reason falsely and imagine that their happiness depends on something Jehovah and his Son disapprove of .
Did this situation constitute a danger for the early Christians ?
At the theaters , even many of the classical plays were either grossly immoral or bloodily violent .
As time passed , public taste for the classics waned , and they were replaced by lewd pantomime shows .
In his book Daily Life in Ancient Rome , historian Jérôme Carcopino says : “ In these plays the actresses were permitted to undress entirely . . .
( b ) How could Satan have used the Roman baths to entrap Christians ?
Chariot races held in vast oblong arenas called circuses were doubtless very exciting , but they were unacceptable for Christians because the crowds often got violent .
Players bet on the odd or even number of pebbles or knucklebones held in the other player’s hand .
He said : “ We are not ignorant of [ Satan’s ] designs . ”
State lotteries give even the poor a glimmer of hope .
In some countries , mixed bathing in saunas and hot springs is popular , not to mention nude bathing on some beaches .
What are some tricks used by Satan to ensnare Jehovah’s servants today ?
Sometimes , they go too far , and the reverse occurs .
Some have fallen into this trap through the abuse of the Internet .
Another of Satan’s snares is disguised occultism .
The wise proverb states : “ Thorns and traps are in the way of the crooked one ; he that is guarding his soul keeps far away from them . ”
Since Satan is “ the god of this system of things , ” anything that is very popular could possibly hide one of his traps . ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 4 ; 1 John 2 : 15 , 16 .
Jesus Opposed the Devil
( a ) What natural desire did Satan exploit to tempt Jesus ?
( b ) What is one of the Devil’s main crafty acts against God’s servants today , but how can we oppose him ?
They are many and varied , but he is using sexual temptations as one of the main crafty acts in his effort to break the integrity of Jehovah’s people .
We might then be testing Jehovah .
( a ) How did the Devil tempt Jesus for the third time ?
( b ) How can James 4 : 7 prove to be true for us ?
When Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for a single act of worship , Jesus again opposed him by quoting Scripture , taking his stand firmly for the exclusive worship of his Father .
Jehovah has supplied us with a full suit of spiritual armor to enable us “ to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil . ”
Our confident hope in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises will be like a helmet protecting our thinking abilities and giving us peace of mind .
But James showed that it is not enough to ‘ oppose the Devil . ’

Jehovah Cares for You
“ Throw all your anxiety upon [ God ] , because he cares for you . ” ​ — 1 PETER 5 : 7 .
Satan is cynical about unselfish human goodness and is permitted to test it under God’s authority and control and within the limits God sets . ’
The account in the book of Job shows that in spite of his tests and trials , Job drew ever closer to Jehovah .
The book of Revelation shows that in this time of the end , Satan continues to accuse Christ’s anointed brothers and assuredly also their faithful companions .
Jehovah Seeks to Help Us
The Devil roves about in the earth , seeking to accuse and devour someone .
The implied answer is : no one .
How is David’s case both a comfort and a warning for us ?
Jehovah heard his prayer and forgave him , although David bore unpleasant consequences for his sin .
It is comforting to know that Jehovah is willing to forgive our sins if we are truly repentant , but it is sobering to realize that sins often bring dire consequences .
He draws such ones to himself by means of his Son .
Need for Seeking Jehovah
This means distancing ourselves from Satan’s wicked system of things .
The apostle Paul wrote of Moses that “ he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible . ”
If Jehovah is as real to us as he was to Enoch , Noah , Job , and Moses , we will “ take notice of him ” in all our ways , and he will “ make [ our ] paths straight . ” ​ — Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 .
The psalmist stated : “ The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him . ”
Are You Aware of Jehovah’s Care ?
Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart ; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves .
Try to recall .
Did you remember to thank Jehovah for having given you the extra strength you needed and for blessing you ?
You may have to think back a week , a month , a year , or more .
Jesus said in prayer to his Father : “ This means everlasting life , their taking in knowledge of you , the only true God , and of the one whom you sent forth , Jesus Christ . ”
We need the help of prayer and holy spirit to comprehend “ the deep things of God . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What should we be determined to do ?
In spite of his trials , Job came to appreciate that Jehovah cared for him

Of course , it is not necessary to apologize for an accident that is not your fault .
An old proverb says : “ In the abundance of words there does not fail to be transgression , but the one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly . ”
Still , you can be courteous and helpful .
Troubled by the thought of being given the cold shoulder , he may not express how he really feels .
However , the biggest hurdle to admitting a mistake is pride .
But is it really necessary to apologize ?
“ My husband never apologizes ”
The Power of an Apology
Upon learning of the situation , Abigail set out to meet David .
Abigail then explained the situation and gave David a gift of food and drink .
At that , he said : “ Go up in peace to your house . See , I have listened to your voice that I may have consideration for your person . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 25 : 2 - 35 .
Another example of someone who knew when to apologize is the apostle Paul .
When onlookers accused Paul of reviling the high priest , the apostle immediately admitted his error , saying : “ Brothers , I did not know he was high priest . For it is written , ‘ You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people . ’ ” ​ — Acts 23 : 1 - 5 .
* Paul’s apology paved the way for the Sanhedrin to listen to what he had to say .
Since Paul was aware of the controversy among the members of the court , he told them that he was being tried for his belief in the resurrection .
Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded ? ”
Although Paul said this to discourage fellow Christians from airing their personal differences in secular courts , the principle is clear : Peace among fellow believers is more important than proving who is right and who is wrong .
For instance , in Japan , the word sumimasen , a typical expression used in apologizing , is heard thousands of times .
To illustrate : A man in line at an airport check - in counter apologized when his luggage nudged the woman waiting next in line .
A few minutes later , when the line moved , the suitcase again touched the woman .
In turn , the one who was offended should readily forgive the repentant wrongdoer .
When an Apology Is Inappropriate
Suppose , for example , that the issue involves integrity to God .
Still , they have no need to apologize for their obedience to God and for their love for their brothers . ​ — Matthew 28 : 19 , 20 ; Romans 13 : 5 - 7 .
No Obstacle to Peace
Adam’s sinful condition was a result of his rebellion against the Creator .
He is ‘ able to bridle his whole body . ’
In the spirit of this counsel , the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses is also conducted openly .
Although congregation meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses are open to the public , prejudice makes some people feel reluctant to enter a Kingdom Hall .
This is true in Finland .
In one area , the Witnesses arranged to have a magazine campaign on the same day that they held an open house at their new Kingdom Hall .
Two Witnesses met an elderly man who said that he enjoyed reading the Watchtower and Awake ! magazines .
His wife , having listened to the conversation , cried out , “ Do not leave without me ! ”
The couple stayed for some time and requested some of the literature that was on display .
One congregation wanted to announce in the local newspaper an open house on the occasion of the dedication of their Kingdom Hall .
( b ) Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to maintain high standards of conduct ?
He said : “ For three years , I attended the Jehovah’s Witnesses ’ annual conventions at the Amarillo Civic Center .
Similar comments about Jehovah’s Witnesses have often been printed .
Why are the Witnesses frequently praised by people who do not share their faith ?
Usually , God’s people are praised because of their good conduct .
The Christian Family
There are children who are “ disobedient to parents ” and adults who have “ no natural affection ” or are “ without self - control . ”
What responsibilities do Christian family members have toward one another ?
Christian parents have weighty responsibilities toward their offspring .
The Christian Brotherhood
What a blessing it is to be part of God’s organization !
Indeed , Jesus said : “ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ”
That is a time when we can strengthen the weak , console the depressed , and comfort the sick .
Our own Kingdom Hall may be in fine condition , but we know that thousands of fellow Christians in other countries lack a suitable place in which to meet .
Well , Jesus commanded them to do so .
This public declaration embraces the work of preaching the good news to those who are not yet our Christian brothers .
To share in it takes time , energy , preparation , training , and the use of personal resources .
Like Paul , may we not be stingy as we pay off this “ debt . ”
Shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem , he wrote a letter to Christians in Asia Minor , and a passage in that letter helps us have a balanced relationship with the world .
In what way are Christians “ aliens and temporary residents , ” and as such , from what should they abstain ?
What , though , are fleshly desires ?
These include such things as the desire to be rich , the desire for prominence , immoral sexual desires , and the desires described as “ envy ” and “ covetousness . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 5 ; 1 Timothy 6 : 4 , 9 ; 1 John 2 : 15 , 16 .
For example , if we cultivate an interest in immoral things , how can we present ourselves “ a sacrifice living , holy , acceptable to God ” ?
If we fall into the trap of materialism , how are we “ seeking first the kingdom ” ?
As Christians , we strive to be exemplary .
In a divided household , the believing husband or wife makes a special effort to follow Christian principles .
For example , Il Tempo of Italy reported : “ People who have Jehovah’s Witnesses as workmates describe them as honest workers , so convinced of their faith that they may appear obsessed by it ; nevertheless , they command respect for their moral integrity . ”
Christian Subjection
For so the will of God is , that by doing good you may muzzle the ignorant talk of the unreasonable men . ”
While we recognize the God - given right of governments to punish lawbreakers , the main reason we submit to secular authority is “ for the Lord’s sake . ”
It is God’s will .
When “ unreasonable men ” oppose us , of what can we be confident ?
Slaves of God
As Christians , in what ways can we avoid abusing our freedom ?
Today , our knowledge of Bible truth frees us from false religious teachings .
Moreover , we have free will , and we can make choices .
We choose to serve Jehovah rather than to be slaves of our own fleshly desires or the fads and trends of the world . ​ — Galatians 5 : 24 ; 2 Timothy 2 : 22 ; Titus 2 : 11 , 12 .
19 - 21 . ( a ) How do we view those in positions of secular authority ?
Peter goes on to say : “ Honor men of all sorts , have love for the whole association of brothers , be in fear of God , have honor for the king . ”
We even pray concerning them , to the end that we may be allowed to pursue our ministry in peace and with godly devotion .
We always work for the good , not the harm , of our Christian brothers .
For example , when one African nation was torn apart by ethnic violence , the Christian conduct of Jehovah’s Witnesses stood out .
When news of the tragic events reached the outside world , Jehovah’s Witnesses in Europe quickly sent food and medical aid to their brothers and others in that afflicted land .
What is that ?
How is that true ?
These questions will be answered in the following article .
[ Picture on page 9 ]
Can we show love for our brothers even if we do not know them personally ?
In view of Jesus ’ words , we may well ask : ‘ Why are true Christians no part of the world ?
“ We Originate With God ”
John’s words about the world are manifestly true .
Hence , a true Christian does not devote his life to some secular cause .
5 , 6 .
Christians are followers of Christ Jesus and subjects of God’s Kingdom , which also makes them no part of the world .
If my kingdom were part of this world , my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews . But , as it is , my kingdom is not from this source . ”
With all of that in mind , true Christians today are subjects of God’s Kingdom , and they follow Jesus ’ counsel to ‘ keep on seeking first the kingdom and God’s righteousness . ’
No human government has the right to impede that God - given work .
We will do no injury or harm to anyone .
In what way are Jehovah’s Witnesses today ambassadors and envoys , and how does this affect their relationship with the nations ?
Because they love God and their brothers , it would be inconceivable for them to take up arms against fellow Christians ​ — or anyone else — ​ in other lands .
How Christians View the World
What attitude of Jehovah toward people in the world do Jehovah’s Witnesses imitate , and how ?
Jehovah has pronounced an adverse judgment on this world , but he has not yet judged all individuals in the world .
14 , 15 . ( a ) In what way was Daniel able to avoid a conflict in the matter of obedience ?
Jesus had commissioned them to make disciples in all nations , which would include Judea .
The apostles were not being rebellious .
How can we stand firm like them ?
We are only “ temporary residents ” in this system of things .
No human can deprive us of that reward as long as we remain faithful to God .

A Hutu and a Tutsi happily work together
That night , however , after the little girl had been put to bed , her mother heard her crying .
We all do ​ — as much as we need counsel and correction .
Does it not warm our heart and brighten our day ?
Even in this troubled world , you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God , his Kingdom , and his wonderful purpose for mankind .
Since they ‘ belong to one another , ’ there is truthful communication and full cooperation among members of spiritual Israel ​ — “ the body of the Christ . ”
We can help new ones by setting a fine example through regular participation in Christian meetings .
In times of distress , we can also offer encouragement or perhaps consolation .
For instance , Aquila and his wife , Priscilla ( Prisca ) , helped Paul .
They received him into their home , worked with him as tentmakers , and helped him to build up the new congregation in Corinth .
What help did Apollos receive ?
Very likely they explained that Christian baptism included undergoing water immersion and receiving the outpouring of holy spirit .
He was the kind of person mentioned at Proverbs 17 : 17 : “ A true companion is loving all the time , and is a brother that is born for when there is distress . ”
Though he had certain health problems , Timothy displayed wholehearted faith and ‘ slaved with Paul in furtherance of the good news . ’
The apostle could therefore tell the Philippians : “ I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to you . ”
True , we must contend with our own human frailties and various trials , but we too can and should display strong faith and loving concern for our spiritual brothers and sisters .
How did Lydia show concern for fellow Christians ?
A native of Thyatira , she was living in Philippi when Paul preached there in about 50 C.E .
The account says : “ Jehovah opened [ Lydia’s ] heart wide to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul .
How did Jesus Christ treat young people ?
People were comfortable around him because he was loving and compassionate .
To receive Kingdom blessings , we must be as humble and teachable as young children .
Jesus showed his love for little ones by taking them into his arms and blessing them .
Surely they should obey their parents and be interested in learning about spiritual things . ​ — Deuteronomy 5 : 16 ; Ephesians 6 : 1 - 3 .
( a ) What did some boys cry out when Jesus was witnessing at the temple ?
Like those children , you young people in the congregation have the grand privilege of praising God and his Son .
We want and need you at our side as Kingdom proclaimers .
When Adversity Strikes
( b ) What effect did the voluntary donations for Judean believers have on Jewish and Gentile Christians ?
Voluntary donations for the holy ones in Judea proved that a bond of brotherhood existed between Jewish and Gentile worshipers of Jehovah .
Hence , there was a sharing that was both material and spiritual in nature .
Contributions for needy fellow believers today are also voluntary and are motivated by love .
Said one report : “ Relief efforts were undertaken by brothers in all parts of El Salvador .
A report from South Africa said : “ The terrible floods that ravaged large parts of Mozambique also affected many of our Christian brothers .
The next article will consider some factors that make this possible .
They thus serve him unitedly , or “ with one consent . ” ​ — The New English Bible .
What enables us to serve Jehovah unitedly ?
This is possible because , wherever we live on earth , we speak the one pure language to Jehovah’s praise .
The apostle Peter made that clear when he preached at the home of the Gentile army officer Cornelius in 36 C.E . and was moved to say : “ For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial , but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him . ”
Since that is true , the Christian congregation is no place for partiality , cliques , or favoritism .
Jehovah’s Witnesses were all sitting together and not in certain cliques . ”
By thus causing dissension , they were opposing the operation of God’s holy spirit , for it promotes unity and peace .
Therefore , let us bear in mind the apostle Paul’s words to the Corinthians : “ I exhort you , brothers , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement , and that there should not be divisions among you , but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought . ”
6 , 7 .
So if we are going to please Jehovah and serve him shoulder to shoulder , we must not show favoritism or ‘ admire personalities for our own benefit . ’ ​ — Jude 4 , 16 .
Keep Free From Murmuring
What did Miriam experience because of her murmuring ?
10 , 11 .
Until the seed of discontent was planted in our mind , the elder’s activities may not have troubled us , but they do now .
Eventually , nothing the elder does will be right in our eyes , and we too may begin to complain about him .
Murmuring about men whose duty it is to shepherd the flock of God may lead to reviling .
Unrepentant revilers will not inherit God’s Kingdom .
Granted , not all complaints are displeasing to God .
He did not ignore “ the cry of complaint ” about Sodom and Gomorrah but destroyed those wicked cities .
How would you differentiate between gossip and slander ?
Since murmuring can lead to harmful gossip , we must be careful about what we say .
God therefore told the Israelites : “ You must not go around among your people for the sake of slandering . ” ​ — Leviticus 19 : 16 .
Jesus condemned such a spirit when he said : “ Stop judging that you may not be judged ; for with what judgment you are judging , you will be judged ; and with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you .
An honest appraisal of our own imperfections ought to hold us back from making judgments that God would consider unrighteous .
We will take the lead in showing them honor .
Individuals who do not conduct themselves in harmony with divine requirements are ‘ vessels lacking honor . ’
So we may well ask ourselves : ‘ Am I an “ honorable vessel ” ?
The situation is similar in the congregation .
Let us therefore be determined to work together harmoniously , like the members of the human body .
Above all , let us remember that we need one another and will enjoy divine approval and blessings if we keep on serving Jehovah shoulder to shoulder .
• Why should we honor fellow believers ?

Loyal Christians joyfully serve Jehovah shoulder to shoulder
“ YOU can call me a beggar ; that doesn’t bother me .
I’m begging for Jesus . ”
Those telling words of a Protestant minister underline the controversy that swirls around religious funding .
Salaries need to be paid , temples need to be built and maintained , evangelizing campaigns need to be financed .
Not tithing is a clear violation of God’s commandments .
Most likely you agree that giving should be part of Christian worship .
[ Footnote ]
The clergyman guaranteed that God was certain to pour out a blessing .
Many desperately poor people dutifully give the tithe because they are being taught by their churches that tithing is a Biblical requirement .
Jehovah assured the Israelites that the Law ‘ would not be too difficult for them . ’
The Law did not specify a penalty for failing to tithe , but each Israelite was under a strong moral obligation to support true worship in this way .
The apostle Paul did not cajole fellow believers to give .
Paul knew that “ God loves a cheerful giver , ” not one who gives “ grudgingly or under compulsion . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 9 : 7 .
Abundant faith and knowledge together with genuine love for fellow Christians would have impelled the Corinthians to give spontaneously . ​ — 2 Corinthians 8 : 7 , 8 .
‘ I do not mean for it to be hard on you , ’ Paul assured them .
Paul did not encourage giving that violated this principle .
It is significant that Paul supervised a ‘ collection for the holy ones ’ who were in need .
The Watchtower , a Bible educational magazine , initially had a monthly distribution of 6,000 copies printed in one language .
To organize their global Bible education work , the Witnesses have built or acquired administrative centers in 110 countries .
Fortunately , before he could sell his home , Genival was visited by Maria , a full - time minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He learned that Christians are blessed when they give generously but that they are not obliged to give beyond their means .
He expresses it this way : “ I may or may not give 10 percent , but I am happy with my contribution , and I am sure that Jehovah is happy too . ”
On the monthly day , if he likes , each puts in a small donation ; but only if it be his pleasure , and only if he be able : for there is no compulsion ; all is voluntary . ” ​ — Apology , Tertullian , c . 197 C.E .
“ As the Church expanded and various institutions arose , it became necessary to make laws which would insure the proper and permanent support of the clergy .

Voluntary contributions finance the preaching work , emergency relief , and the construction of meeting places
( b ) What is meant by “ meditate ” and “ ponder ” ?
AS DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ , we should be deeply concerned about our relationship with God and our reasons for serving Him .
Even as we set aside specific time each day for essential activities , such as eating and sleeping , we must likewise allow time each day to meditate on Jehovah’s activities and dealings . ​ — Deuteronomy 8 : 3 ; Matthew 4 : 4 .
What does it mean to meditate ?
To what is making spiritual advancement directly related ?
They listen to the audiocassettes of the Bible and the Watchtower and Awake !
And I shall certainly meditate on all your activity , and with your dealings I will concern myself . ” ​ — Psalm 77 : 11 , 12 .
Thousands of years ago , Joshua succeeded Moses as the leader of Israel .
To gain Jehovah’s blessing , Joshua had to read God’s Word for himself .
Perhaps the speaker is not the most experienced , but while he is handling the Word of God , he is worthy of our careful attention .
They imply a willingness to study with a view to gaining discernment , to perceiving what Jehovah’s will is .
This , of course , requires effort , and that leads us to Solomon’s next words and illustration . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 15 - 17 .
This makes us think of the mining exploits of men who over the centuries have searched for the so - called precious metals silver and gold .
Others have spent a lifetime trying to find it .
Yet , with what zeal men have sought gold , with its artificial and arbitrary value !
* With how much more zeal we should seek wisdom , discernment , and understanding of God and his will !
What can we find if we study God’s Word ?
However , they have failed to find “ the very knowledge of God . ”
Here is another incentive that Solomon highlights : “ Jehovah himself gives wisdom ; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment . ”
Our aim is to be walking , talking , practicing Christians , always ready to help others , in the refreshing spirit of Christ .
How should our personal study affect what we do and say ?
Paul made the same point when he urged fellow Christians in Colossae “ to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him ” by “ bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God . ”
The weapon we have is “ the knowledge of God , ” which is capable of “ bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ . ”
This is all the more reason for us to pay attention to daily Bible study , as we want to flush out selfish , fleshly thoughts from our mind . ​ — 2 Corinthians 10 : 5 .
How can we benefit ourselves as Jehovah teaches us ?
That is why it is good to follow along at Christian meetings with an open Bible .
He was a sincere believer in God , and he studied the Scriptures .
“ ‘ Really , how could I ever do so , unless someone guided me ? ’
How can we use it effectively in our personal study ? ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 14 - 17 .
What questions about personal study now require an answer ?
• What motive should we have in our personal study ?
• What aids to Bible understanding do we have ?
Members of the Bethel family find it spiritually strengthening to start each day by considering a Bible text
[ Credit Line ]
“ FOR everything there is an appointed time , ” says the Bible at Ecclesiastes 3 : 1 .
So , what is the solution ?
What is often the best time for personal study ?
The prophet Isaiah showed similar appreciation when he said : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones , that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word . He awakens morning by morning ; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones . ”
When we are studying , our mind must be stimulated , and too much physical comfort seems to do the opposite .
He also spoke about the value of finding a private place for praying . ​ — Matthew 6 : 6 ; 14 : 13 ; Mark 6 : 30 - 32 .
This is a fundamental point because a person cannot worship the true God if he does not know Him or perhaps doubts His existence .
Every religious philosophy has a different answer to the question of God’s identity .
The translation that he used omitted the distinctive divine name , Jehovah . ​ — Psalm 103 : 1 , 2 .
Compare that with : “ O LORD , our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth ! ”
( King James Version ; see also The New American Bible , The Holy Bible ​ — New International Version , Tanakh — ​ The Holy Scriptures ) Yet , as mentioned in the preceding article , we can obtain “ the very knowledge of God ” if we allow his Word to illuminate us .
( b ) How have many translators failed to show respect for God’s name ?
We can turn to the brochure The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever , which has been translated into 69 languages .
* The section entitled “ God’s Name ​ — Its Meaning and Pronunciation ” ( pages 6 - 11 ) shows clearly that the Hebrew Tetragrammaton ( from the Greek , meaning “ four letters ” ) appears almost 7,000 times in the ancient Hebrew texts .
* How can they claim to know God and have an acceptable relationship with him if they refuse to acknowledge him by his name ?
Who Is Jesus Christ ?
What further question deserves our attention ?
The discussions above regarding God and Jesus Christ serve to illustrate ways in which we can do personal study with a view to helping those unacquainted with Bible truth to gain accurate knowledge .
This would be similar to saying : “ I do not really need to pay much attention to my diet now , for look at all the meals I have eaten in the past . ”
We know that the body requires constant nourishment from good , properly prepared food in order to keep it healthy and active .
Therefore , all of us , whether longtime Bible students or not , need to heed Paul’s counsel to Timothy , who was by then a mature , responsible overseer : “ Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching .
Why should we take Paul’s advice to heart ?
Our complacency can be just the sort of opening that he is looking for . ​ — Ephesians 6 : 11 , 12 ; 1 Peter 5 : 8 .
What spiritual defense do we have , and how can we maintain it ?
Regular personal study of the Bible and Bible publications is vital to the maintenance of our spiritual armor . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 - 47 ; Ephesians 6 : 14 , 15 .
What can we do to be sure that our “ large shield of faith ” is in good working order ?
Do I encourage others by my enthusiastic involvement in the meetings ? ’
We must not neglect our regular personal Bible study , our Christian meetings , and the complete suit of armor from God .
Together , these give us the ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to hate that which God hates . ​ — Psalm 97 : 10 ; Romans 12 : 9 .
If we become skilled in the use of that “ sword , ” then when we face temptations , we will be able to cut through what may appear to be harmless , or even appealing , and expose it as a death - dealing trap of the wicked one .
Do I have a hard time recalling Bible texts that can strengthen the offense ? ’
Normally , a newly interested person who is studying the Require brochure would move on to the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life , both published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Suggestions given here will help clear up obstacles to spiritual progress .

For effective personal study , you need the right setting with minimal distractions
Revelation 20 : 8 describes the final assault by Satan on the people living on earth at the end of the thousand - year rule of the Messianic Kingdom .
Thus , it can be said that the expression represents an unknown , undetermined number .
Often the expression “ the sand of the sea ” refers to something of a substantial and impressive quantity or size .
Though what was spoken of in each case was substantial , it was still finite .
Jehovah told Abraham : “ I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore . ”
Often it represents a number unknown but sizable .
WHEN faced with trying circumstances , do you long for “ the good old days ” ?
for it is not due to wisdom that you have asked about this . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 7 : 10 .
Actually , now is the best time to be alive , in spite of increasing world problems .
Even some anointed Christians in the first century needed to strengthen their relationship with Jehovah God .
The Christian overseer James had to warn some regarding their fleshly tendencies and loss of spiritual cleanness .
In the midst of that counsel , he gave this powerful exhortation : “ Draw close to God , and he will draw close to you . ”
What did James mean by “ draw close ” ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) Of what might some of James ’ first - century readers have been reminded by the expression “ draw close to God ” ?
How , though , may we take advantage of this marvelous opportunity ?
5 , 6 .
In the Hebrew Scriptures , for example , we read that when Samuel was a boy , he “ had not yet come to know Jehovah . ”
7 , 8 . ( a ) Why should we not be intimidated by the Bible’s deeper teachings ?
Do not be satisfied with the basics .
Seek to take in some of the Bible’s deeper teachings .
If so , remember that Jehovah is the “ Grand Instructor . ”
Remember , no man has reason to boast in his knowledge .
Note some Biblical statements about Jehovah .
Clearly , we will never know all there is to know about Jehovah .
He has taught us many wonderful things , yet we will always have before us an infinite body of knowledge from which to learn more .
( b ) What determines whether a person’s love for God is genuine ?
Fittingly , the apostle Paul made a connection between knowledge and love .
Of course , many who claim to love God really do not .
Why not ?
How will godly fear help us to demonstrate our love for Jehovah ?
Such fear is crucial to drawing close to him .
In fact , note what Psalm 25 : 14 says : “ The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him . ”
Godly fear will also move us to keep clean ​ — spiritually , morally , and physically .
Of course , expressing our love for Jehovah involves far more than refraining from what is bad .
For instance , how do we respond to Jehovah’s overwhelming generosity ?
Granted , when we give to Jehovah of our possessions , we do not enrich him .
And when we give to Jehovah of our time and energy , we are not filling a need that he cannot otherwise meet .
Such giving makes his heart rejoice , much the way a little gift from a beloved child delights a parent .
19 , 20 .
Why meditate before we pray , and what are some fitting subjects for such meditation ?
We might try meditating before we pray .
For what sins do we need forgiveness , and toward whom do we need to be more forgiving ?
For instance , if a challenging problem is looming ahead of us , causing us some anxiety and even fear for our well - being or that of our loved ones , we might read over the prayer of Jacob regarding his upcoming meeting with his vengeful brother , Esau .
Reading and meditating on such prayers can strengthen our faith and give us ideas as to how best to approach Jehovah with the concerns that weigh us down .
Throughout the year 2003 , while we keep in mind James 4 : 8 as the yeartext , let us continue to examine ourselves as to whether we are indeed drawing close to Jehovah .
What , though , about the latter part of that statement ?
• Why is drawing close to Jehovah something to take seriously ?
( b ) How does the Bible assure us that humans are far from insignificant in Jehovah’s eyes ?
Let us discuss some of the marvelous blessings that Jehovah showers upon those who are close to him .
Why can “ the very knowledge of God ” be compared to “ hid treasures ” ?
Illustrate .
For one thing , the knowledge of God has great value .
What could be more valuable than a close relationship with Jehovah based on “ the very knowledge of God ” ?
Of earth’s six billion inhabitants , some six million worshipers of Jehovah , or about 1 in 1,000 , have found “ the very knowledge of God . ”
It is an integral part of the religions of Christendom .
It also prevails in Buddhism , Hinduism , Islam , Jainism , Judaism , Shinto , Sikhism , and Taoism .
6 , 7 . ( a ) Who only can find “ the very knowledge of God ” ?
( b ) What example shows that Jehovah has blessed us with insight that escapes many “ wise and intellectual ones ” ?
Consider an example .
Why ?
The desire of those fearing him he will perform , and their cry for help he will hear , and he will save them .
Yes , Jehovah is near to those who love him and therefore can be swift in responding to their cries for help .
Nevertheless , Jehovah does provide physical protection for his people as a group .
These spiritually qualified men endeavor to reflect Jehovah’s own heartfelt compassion in helping fellow worshipers . ​ — James 5 : 14 , 15 .
By means of printed publications , including the journals The Watchtower and Awake ! , as well as by meetings , assemblies , and conventions , Jehovah supplies us with what we need when we need it .
Access to the “ Hearer of Prayer ”
14 , 15 . ( a ) What personal blessing does Jehovah bestow upon those who are close to him ?
Have you ever noticed that as humans gain power and authority , they often become less accessible to those under them ?
Is he too far removed to be interested in the expressions made to him by mere humans ?
Being granted free access to the “ Hearer of prayer ” is a truly remarkable privilege .
The Son has been given “ authority to do judging . ”
Thus , the psalmist David stated : “ [ Jehovah ] hears my voice . ”
We too have every reason to be confident that Jehovah is close , ready to hear our every thought and care .
17 , 18 . ( a ) How does Jehovah feel about the faithful service of his intelligent creatures ?
Nevertheless , Jehovah is an appreciative God .
The Bible clearly shows that Jehovah values what his worshipers do .
For example , we read : “ He that is showing favor to the lowly one is lending to Jehovah , and his treatment He will repay to him . ”
Jehovah promises to repay that debt with favor and blessings .
How grateful we are to know that our merciful deeds do not go unnoticed by our heavenly Father ! ​ — Matthew 5 : 7 .
( a ) Why can we be assured that Jehovah appreciates what we do in the preaching and disciple - making work ?
But Jehovah treasures every gift ​ — no matter how small — ​ that springs from a heart motivated by love .
In addition to rich spiritual blessings now , we can look forward to the joys of life in the coming new world , where Jehovah will generously open his hand and satisfy the righteous desires of all who are close to him ! ​ — Psalm 145 : 16 ; 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
Throughout the year 2003 , let us ask ourselves if we are making continuous effort to draw close to our heavenly Father .
And with what result ?
A response to the article “ Jehovah Is Greater Than Our Hearts , ” in the May 1 , 2000 , issue of The Watchtower , pages 28 - 31 .
• What provisions does Jehovah make for the spiritual protection of his people ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
Others , unable to accept that God could permit suffering even if he does not cause it , have chosen to deny that suffering exists .
In the wake of the tragic events of history , especially from the first world war until our day , many have reached the conclusion that God is simply unable to prevent suffering .
“ If God is to be intelligible in some manner , ” he added , “ then His goodness must be compatible with the existence of evil , and this is only if He is not all - powerful . ”
God did not create humans to suffer .
Tragically , Adam and Eve failed to obey God .
A rebellious spirit creature , later identified as Satan the Devil , convinced Eve that it was not in her best interests to obey God .
Satan claimed that if she ate of the tree , ‘ her eyes were bound to be opened and she was bound to be like God , knowing good and bad . ’
Settling the Issue
No , because that would have further undermined respect for his authority , perhaps encouraging future rebellions and resulting in even greater suffering .
In addition , condoning such disobedience would have made God a party to wrongdoing .
In his perfect wisdom , Jehovah God decided to allow the rebellion to proceed for a limited time .
At the same time , God took steps to ensure that his original purpose for the earth would be fulfilled .
He promised that a “ seed , ” or “ offspring , ” would come who would ‘ bruise Satan in the head , ’ eliminating once and for all his rebellion and its damaging effects . ​ — Genesis 3 : 15 , footnote .
Jesus mentioned this divine provision when he taught his followers to pray : “ Our Father in the heavens , . . . let your kingdom come .
In fulfillment of Bible prophecy , his Kingdom was established in the heavens in 1914 with Jesus Christ as its King .
* Shortly , it will crush and put an end to all human governments . ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 .
The Bible promises that by means of Christ’s rule , God “ will wipe out every tear from [ mankind’s ] eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 4 .
He admits : “ I still miss my wife very much , but I now firmly believe that nothing Jehovah allows to happen can cause us lasting harm . ”
“ Throw all your anxiety upon [ God ] . ”
Like faithful men of old , we can open our heart to him and express our doubts and anxieties .
Humans suffer privation , sickness , and loss .
This well - founded hope will protect us as a helmet protects the head .
Adam and Eve rejected divine rulership
[ Picture on page 7 ]
Others , though , who underestimated the danger or just ignored the warning signs chose to remain .
However , like the disaster at Pompeii and Herculaneum , the destruction of Jerusalem did not happen without warning .
5 , 6 . ( a ) What prophetic words of Jesus were fulfilled in 66 C.E . ?
The destruction of Jerusalem and its temple meant the end of the Jewish state and its religious system based on the Mosaic Law .
* ​ — Mark 13 : 1 , 2 .
( a ) What dangerous attitude would some develop ?
Walking about is more conducive to alertness than sitting down all night .
Similarly , staying spiritually active will help us as Christians to stay awake .
The Greek word rendered “ keeping close in mind ” can be literally translated “ speeding up . ”
True , we cannot change Jehovah’s timetable .
Hence , Paul counsels : “ Let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation . ”
What statistics indicate that many today are following Peter’s counsel to stay awake ?
Some years ago , Eduardo and Noemi took note of Paul’s words : “ The scene of this world is changing . ”
As time went by , they were blessed in many ways and even shared in the circuit and district work .
Despite having faced serious problems , Eduardo and Noemi are convinced that they made the right decision when they sacrificed material comfort in favor of the full - time service .
What attitude was shown by a young brother in Côte d’Ivoire ?
How did a young Witness in Belgium show that she was not intimidated by prejudice ?
The information was much appreciated , and the following week the students were given a test in which all the questions dealt with the Christian religion of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
In spite of well - publicized economic problems , Argentina reported a new peak of 126,709 Witnesses last year .
There is still widespread poverty in Mozambique .
The monthly average of 5,309,289 Bible studies reported last year worldwide show that there are still many sheeplike people who hunger for Bible truth .
Of the new peak of 15,597,746 attending the Memorial , the majority are not yet actively serving Jehovah .
Why is it vital to stay awake now more than ever before ?
Yes , now more than ever before , we must stay awake !
It is unlikely that Jerusalem in the first century had more than 120,000 inhabitants .
Of course , from Jehovah’s standpoint , the Mosaic Law was replaced by the new covenant in 33 C.E . ​ — Ephesians 2 : 15 .
( See bound volume )
In 66 C.E . , the Christian community in Jerusalem heeded Jesus ’ warning
[ Pictures on page 10 ]
Staying active helps Christians to stay awake
“ Keep on the Watch ” !
One night , however , while he and his wife were sleeping , a thief entered the bedroom .
He will long remember the painful lesson that he learned : A sleeping man cannot guard his possessions .
He described the events that would lead up to his coming as Judge , and then he warned : “ Keep on the watch , therefore , because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming .
But know one thing , that if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into .
In words recorded in the Gospel of Luke , Jesus compared Christians to slaves waiting for their master to return from a wedding .
In a similar way , Jesus said : “ At an hour that you do not think likely the Son of man is coming . ”
What conviction will motivate us to stay on the watch , and how did Jesus show this ?
It would have been difficult to keep awake all that night if they thought that their master might come some other night .
How can we stay awake ?
He just had to keep on the watch .
Jesus referred to four different watches during which the master might arrive .
Three Apostles Who Could Not Keep Awake
Likely , what contributed to the apostles ’ drowsiness ?
Of course , Jesus understood ​ — as his disciples did not at the time — ​ that soon he would be arrested and condemned to death .
Jesus had warned his apostles of these things , but they had not understood what he was saying .
As was true of the apostles , our flesh is also weak and there are things that we do not yet know .
What three qualities does Paul link to keeping our senses ?
We have already seen the importance of prayer and the need for keeping in mind Jehovah’s day .
Our sure hope is like “ an anchor for the soul ” that enables us to endure difficulties even if we have to wait for the certain fulfillment of God’s promises .
As Paul wrote , “ there remain faith , hope , love , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . ”
“ [ Love ] hopes all things , endures all things .
“ Keep On Holding Fast What You Have ”
Rather than slacken the hand , what attitude should we cultivate ?
By being “ vigilant with a view to prayers ” and by cultivating faith , hope , and love , we will prove ourselves ready at the hour of test .
We have plenty to do in the work of the Lord .
( a ) Why should occasional disappointments not discourage us ?
“ Jehovah is my share , ” Jeremiah wrote , “ that is why I shall show a waiting attitude for him .
Good it is that one should wait , even silently , for the salvation of Jehovah . ”
How short , though , this waiting period is when compared with the eternity ahead !
And while we wait for Jehovah’s due time , we can cultivate essential Christian qualities and help others to take advantage of Jehovah’s patience and embrace the truth .
[ Box / Picture on page 21 ]
Imagine that a watchman suspects that a thief is planning to burgle the premises he is guarding .
Something similar can happen to those who are “ eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ . ”
Years later , Christians in Thessalonica had to be reminded that Jesus ’ presence was some time in the future .
That is his job .
Questions From Readers
However , in the context of 1 Corinthians 11 : 25 , 26 , Paul was discussing , not how often , but how the Memorial should be observed .
In the original Greek , he did not use the word pol·laʹkis , which means “ often ” or “ frequently . ”
Rather , he used the word ho·saʹkis , which means “ as often as , ” an idiom meaning “ whenever , ” “ every time that . ”
This connection with the annual Jewish Passover is further evidence that the Memorial of Jesus ’ death should be observed just once a year .
Moreover , Paul associated Jesus ’ death with another annual Jewish feast , the Day of Atonement .
There is no Scriptural reason to observe the Memorial more frequently than that .
In harmony with this , historian John Laurence von Mosheim reports that the second - century Christians in Asia Minor were accustomed to observing the Memorial of Jesus ’ death “ on the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month [ Nisan ] . ”
It was only in later years that it became customary in Christendom to observe it more often than once a year . [ Footnote ]
“ The kingdom of God has drawn near . Be repentant , you people , and have faith in the good news . ” ​ — MARK 1 : 15 .
His preaching work moved righthearted ones to repent .
Addressing Jews in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33 C.E . , Peter said : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
In our day , faith in the good news is moving thousands to repent of their sins , make a dedication to God , and be baptized .
Moreover , they are practicing righteousness and have taken their stand on the side of God’s Kingdom .
But what is faith ?
Faith is also “ the evident demonstration , ” or evidence for conviction , regarding unseen things .
We Need Faith !
However , Christians must have faith in order to inherit God’s promises .
What is “ the sin that easily entangles us ” ?
To maintain strong faith , we must ‘ look intently at Jesus ’ and follow his example .
6 , 7 .
Why is it proper to pray for faith ?
We cannot create faith within ourselves by our own willpower .
Yes , let us pray for holy spirit , for it can produce in us the faith needed to do God’s will even under the most trying circumstances . ​ — Ephesians 3 : 20 .
As Christians , we have faith in God and in his Son .
It can exert a powerful force for good in our life if we study and apply it in full faith that it provides the best counsel and direction available to us . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Our life as imperfect humans is filled with trouble .
Or we may be guided by Jehovah’s holy spirit in some other way .
Faith in God’s Word gives us what assurance regarding our daily needs ?
Faith in God’s Word gives us the assured expectation that Jehovah will care for our daily needs and will eventually make abundant provision for all who love him .
Jehovah similarly provided for the prophet Jeremiah during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem .
Although Jeremiah and Elijah had little to eat , Jehovah took care of them .
Faith Helps Us to Endure Grief
13 , 14 .
‘ I have hope toward God , ’ said Paul , ‘ that there is going to be a resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous . ’
In the meantime , faith will not remove all sorrow , but it will keep us close to God , who helps us to endure bereavement . ​ — Psalm 121 : 1 - 3 ; 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 .
So devastated was Peter after denying Jesus that he “ wept bitterly . ”
Instead of viewing them as one major plight , we may be able to resolve them one at a time by applying Bible principles .
We may experience a great test of our faith when we or our loved ones suffer serious illness .
Moreover , regarding “ anyone acting with consideration toward the lowly one , ” the psalmist sang : “ Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness ; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness . ”
Why can it be said that faith can carry us through “ the calamitous days ” of old age ?
True , he is our Sovereign Lord , but he is also our Creator and Father .
“ You are my Father , my God and the Rock of my salvation , ” sang the psalmist .
Moreover , we have this assurance : “ Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 12 : 22 .
What is required for us to enjoy a lasting relationship with Jehovah ?
Having strong faith , even if we should die , we are his dedicated servants with a resurrection hope .
Let us keep that comforting thought in our heart as we maintain our confidence in God’s Word and continue to have faith in the good news .
In fact , ‘ without faith it is impossible to be well - pleasing to God . ’
Therefore , we wisely pray for holy spirit and for faith , which is part of its blessed fruitage .
And our faith is strengthened when we speak to others in the ministry . ​ — Psalm 145 : 10 - 13 ; Romans 10 : 11 - 15 .
By offering Scriptural counsel and encouragement , loving Christian elders help us to build up our faith .
( Contemporary English Version ) The righteous live by reason of faith .
Upon hearing such words , Enoch’s godless enemies surely wanted to kill him .
Yet , he boldly spoke out in faith , and God “ took him ” by putting him to sleep in death , apparently without allowing him to suffer its pangs .
However , “ in faith all these died , although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises . ”
The Promised Land did not come under their control , and they did not see all nations bless themselves by means of Abraham’s seed .
How do we know that Joseph pursued a goal far higher than that of worldly prominence ?
By divine providence , Jacob’s son Joseph served as Egypt’s food administrator , but it was not his goal to be a great man of this world .
Joseph asked to be buried in the land of promise .
At death , he was embalmed and laid in a coffin in Egypt .
Faith like that of Joseph should move us to pursue goals far higher than worldly prominence . ​ — 1 Corinthians 7 : 29 - 31 .
What effect did faith have on Rahab’s life ?
She was “ declared righteous by works [ of faith ] , after she had received the [ Israelite ] messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way , ” so that they eluded their Canaanite enemies .
King David committed adultery with Bath - sheba , had her husband killed in battle , and then took her as his wife .
Repenting in deep sorrow , David petitioned Jehovah : “ Your holy spirit O do not take away from me . ”
He had faith that Jehovah , in his mercy , would not despise “ a heart broken and crushed ” over sin .
Faith Bolstered by Assurance
When the Midianites and their allies invaded Israel , God’s spirit enveloped Gideon .
The situation was reversed in the second test .
We actually show faith by consulting the Bible and Christian publications and by praying for the guidance of holy spirit when making decisions . ​ — Romans 8 : 26 , 27 .
How may we be helped by reflecting on the faith of Barak ?
Deborah encouraged Barak to act as Israel’s God - appointed leader , and he was one of Jehovah’s servants who through faith “ routed the armies of foreigners . ”
When Paul was a prisoner in Rome in about 65 C.E . , he told Timothy : “ Take Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for ministering . ”
Faith Enables Us to Endure
What trying situation never destroyed the faith of Isaac and Rebekah ?
• What Scriptural proof is there that faith can make us courageous ?
• How does faith promote peace ?
Faith gave Noah and Enoch the courage to declare Jehovah’s messages
[ Pictures on page 18 ]
Each individual must make a personal decision in this regard .
Oath taking has long been a widespread practice .
In ancient times , for instance , the Greeks raised a hand toward heaven or touched an altar while taking an oath .
For example , this was done by Boaz , David , Solomon , and Zedekiah .
A person taking an oath before Jehovah sometimes made an accompanying gesture .
The disciple James made a similar point .
Otherwise , he may be permitted to give an affirmation that he is not lying . ​ — Galatians 1 : 20 .
WHEN Jesus Christ , the Founder of Christianity , returned to heaven , he did not leave behind on this earth books written by him , monuments built by him , or riches amassed by him .
In fact , in the Gospel of John , we find that Jesus mentioned three important requirements that anyone who wants to be his follower must meet .
As a result , halfway through the festival , “ many of the crowd put faith in him . ”
With those words , Jesus was not suggesting that the new believers were lacking in faith .
Indeed , Jesus viewed endurance as such an important quality for his followers that in his very last conversation with his apostles , recorded in the Gospel of John , Jesus twice urged : “ Continue following me . ”
What enabled the early Christians to endure ?
They had heartfelt appreciation for it .
“ Hearing the Word ”
( a ) What different types of soil are mentioned by Jesus in one of his illustrations ?
( b ) What do the seed and the soil in Jesus ’ illustration represent ?
As you read the accounts , you will note that the key feature of the illustration is that the same kind of seed falls on various types of soil , producing different results .
They “ retain it and bear fruit with endurance . ”
The word of God remains in them .
Consequently , they bear fruit with endurance .
“ The heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer . ”
( a ) When reading the Bible , what should we avoid but what should we do ?
( Include the box “ Firmly Set in the Truth . ” )
It also moves us to share our intimate thoughts with God in prayer .
Similarly , making time for studying and meditating on God’s Word can result in the heart’s becoming like fine , productive soil .
The key is not to become too preoccupied with the mundane things of life .
When the seed falls on the second type of soil , it does not just remain on it , as in the first case .
It takes root and sprouts .
But then when the sun rises , the sprout is scorched by the heat of the sun and withers .
The real reason that the sprout withers is not the heat .
After all , the plant that comes up in the fine soil is also exposed to the sun , but it does not wither ​ — in fact , it thrives .
A “ rock - mass , ” or rock - shelf , situated right under the layer of top soil , prevents the seed from sinking its roots deep enough to find moisture and stability .
When exposed to the blazing sun of “ tribulation or persecution , ” they become so fearful that they lose their joy and strength and give up following Christ .
The deeper reason for their fear , however , is not opposition .
After all , millions of Christ’s disciples endure various forms of tribulation , yet they remain faithful .
Consequently , the appreciation they develop for Jehovah and his word is too superficial and too feeble to withstand opposition .
An individual needs to make sure that no rocklike obstacles , such as deep - seated bitterness , underlying self - interest , or similar hard but hidden feelings , are lodged in his heart .
Thereafter , prayerful meditation will stimulate an “ implanting of the word ” deep in the individual’s heart .
Like the fine soil , the thorny soil lets the seed take root and sprout .
The truth of God’s word is sown in their heart , but it faces competition from other pursuits that vie for their attention .
What Are Your Answers ?
• How can you find time to reflect on God’s word ?
What helps them to endure ?
Consider some of their comments .
“ I end each day with reading a portion of the Bible and saying a prayer .
This gives me something fresh to meditate on during the day . ” ​ — Marie , baptized 1935 .
By giving priority to spiritual matters , we can “ bear fruit with endurance ”
“ By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — JOHN 13 : 35 .
“ LITTLE children . ”
In fact , Jesus spoke of love some 30 times that night .
Why is showing love so important for Christians ?
Jesus explained why love is so important .
Being a follower of Christ goes hand in hand with showing brotherly love .
What admonition regarding love did the apostle Paul give ?
As it was among Christ’s followers in the first century , this outstanding love is observable today among Christ’s genuine disciples .
Even so , Paul added : “ Go on doing it in fuller measure . ”
In the same inspired letter , Paul encouraged his fellow believers to “ speak consolingly to the depressed souls ” and to “ support the weak . ”
Jesus too gave instructions concerning helping those who are weak .
Why should we do so ?
A Lost Sheep and a Lost Coin
( b ) What do these illustrations reveal about Jehovah ?
One was about a shepherd .
And when he has found it he puts it upon his shoulders and rejoices .
And when he gets home he calls his friends and his neighbors together , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep that was lost . ’
Jesus said : “ What woman with ten drachma coins , if she loses one drachma coin , does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it ?
( b ) What does their reaction tell us about how they viewed the missing possession ?
I’m content with the nine I still have . ’
The concern of the shepherd and the woman reflects , therefore , in its own small way , the feelings of Jehovah and his heavenly creatures .
( b ) According to Jesus ’ two illustrations , how can we express our concern for them ?
In the first of the two illustrations , Jesus says that the shepherd will “ go for the lost one . ”
Christian elders , in particular , have the responsibility to “ strengthen the weak hands . . . and make the knees that are wobbling firm ” and to “ say to those who are anxious at heart : ‘ Be strong .
Do not be afraid . ’ ”
Rather , Paul’s words were directed to the entire “ congregation of the Thessalonians . ”
What does the shepherd do when he finally finds the lost sheep ?
The sheep may have wandered for days and nights through unfamiliar territory , perhaps even being exposed to the threat of stalking lions .
Why should we reflect the tenderness that the shepherd showed toward the strayed sheep ?
Our heartfelt expressions may gently and gradually lift him up to the point that he is able to return to the flock .
What should we do next ?
( b ) What earnest efforts did the woman put forth , and with what result ?
First , she lights a lamp to brighten her dark house .
Then , she sweeps the floor with her broom , hoping to hear a tinkling sound .
Finally , she carefully searches every nook and cranny until the lamp catches a glint of a silver coin .
At the same time , we realize that it requires effort .
What can we do ?
Two of our new tools , or publications , will be especially helpful in this endeavor .
Assisting those who are weak brings blessings to all .
[ Footnote ]
IT WAS the evening before his death .
By now , it must have been past midnight , but Jesus , moved by love for his close friends , continued speaking .
Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away , and every one bearing fruit he cleans , that it may bear more fruit .
My Father is glorified in this , that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples .
Room for Growth
What can we learn from the fact that Jehovah “ takes away ” every branch not bearing fruit ?
What does this tell us ?
It tells us not only that all disciples are required to bear fruit but also that all are capable of doing so , no matter what their circumstances or limitations may be .
How did Jesus Christ stress the value of the first - mentioned fruit of the spirit ?
In fact , throughout his conversation that final night of his earthly life , Jesus repeatedly reminded the apostles of the need to show the quality of love . ​ — John 14 : 15 , 21 , 23 , 24 ; 15 : 12 , 13 , 17 .
Bearing Kingdom Fruit
( b ) What question deserves our consideration ?
Notice how the apostle Paul stresses this vital link .
In this way , Paul further explains , we “ offer to God a sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips ” ​ — the second kind of fruitage that we need to manifest .
Does bearing fruit equal making disciples ?
To answer properly , we need first to understand what constitutes Kingdom fruitage .
How does Jesus ’ illustration of the sower and the different types of soil show what Kingdom fruitage is and what it is not ?
Well , after a wheat stalk sprouts and matures , it produces as fruit , not little wheat stalks , but new seed .
Likewise , a Christian produces as fruit , not necessarily new disciples , but new Kingdom seed .
How may Kingdom fruitage be defined ?
The bearing of fruitage in this case refers to making expressions about the Kingdom .
Yes , it is !
Giving Our Best for God’s Glory
To whatever extent we are able to produce Kingdom fruitage , we will be moved to “ go on and keep bearing fruit ” when we keep in mind why we are doing so .
Witnesses of Jehovah worldwide agree . ​ — See the box “ How to ‘ Bear Fruit With Endurance , ’ ” on page 21 .
The first Kingdom proclaimer mentioned in the Gospels is John the Baptizer .
Indeed , some to whom John preached became disciples of Christ .
Not surprisingly , then , Jesus commanded his followers not only to preach the Kingdom message but also to help individuals who accept it to become his disciples .
Even so , some seeds still fall on fine soil , take root , and sprout , just as Jesus foretold .
Personal Interest Makes a Difference
* Since the mother is usually home and proud to show visitors her baby , often a conversation ensues .
Showing initiative and personal interest may lead to similar joyful results in our ministry .
( a ) Why is the requirement to ‘ bear much fruit ’ within reach of all of us ?
How reassuring it is to know that the requirement to “ keep bearing much fruit ” is within our reach !
Whether we are young or old , whether we have good health or poor health , whether we preach in receptive or less receptive territories , all of us are able to bear much fruit .
[ Footnotes ]
Although the vine’s branches in the illustration refer to Jesus ’ apostles and other Christians who are in line for a place in God’s heavenly Kingdom , the illustration contains truths from which all of Christ’s followers today can benefit . ​ — John 3 : 16 ; 10 : 16 .
HOW TO “ BEAR FRUIT WITH ENDURANCE ”
It says that we share in the ministry ‘ under God’s view , in company with Christ . ’
“ Frankly , the preaching work is a personal struggle for me .
I try to have a relaxed approach , conversing with people and listening to their viewpoint . ” ​ — Daniel , age 75 ; baptized 1946 .
It gives me joy to know that our ministry is a team effort . ” ​ — Joan , age 66 ; baptized 1954 .
IS SINCERITY really desirable in our daily life ?
Who would not appreciate having such a sincere person working for him ?
The ancient Israelites enjoyed God’s blessing when they carefully observed the laws and the festivals .
It must be complemented with truth .
Certain first - century Jews might sincerely have believed in their way of worshiping God , but their zeal was “ not according to accurate knowledge . ”
For us to be acceptable to God , our sincere beliefs must be based on accurate information .
“ I received from the Lord that which I also handed on to you . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 11 : 23 .
What did Jesus do on Passover night in 33 C.E . ?
It was Thursday evening , March 31 , 33 C.E . , and a full moon very likely adorned the skies above Jerusalem .
Jesus Christ and his apostles had just concluded the Passover celebration .
What was it ?
What was its significance ?
“ Keep Doing This ”
Why was what Jesus did on the night of Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . , significant ?
The step that Jesus Christ took on the night of Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . , was much more than a passing incident in his life .
When the first man sinned against God , he forfeited perfect human life and all its prospects .
How we should appreciate that love !
How is it that anointed Christians partake of the Memorial “ often ” ?
Individual anointed Christians would partake of the Memorial emblems until their death .
Thus , before Jehovah God and the world , they would repeatedly proclaim their faith in God’s provision of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
Since Jesus would not be drinking literal wine in heaven , he obviously had in mind the joy sometimes symbolized by wine .
Another historian states : “ The usage of the Quartodeciman churches of Asia was continuous with that of the Jerusalem church .
What kind of bread did Jesus use when instituting the Lord’s Evening Meal ?
( a ) Why is it fitting that the Memorial bread be unleavened ?
Regarding the bread used when instituting the Memorial , Jesus said : “ This means my body which is in your behalf . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses keep this in mind and follow the precedent set by Jesus by using unleavened bread at Memorial observances .
In some cases , they use unseasoned Jewish matzos having no extra ingredients , such as onions or eggs .
Otherwise , unleavened bread can be made with a small amount of whole - grain flour ( where possible , wheat ) mixed with a little water .
Significance of the Wine
That would have been a meaningless accusation if the wine were mere grape juice .
What kind of wine is suitable for Memorial observances , and why ?
Only red wine is a suitable symbol of what the cup’s contents represent , that is , Jesus ’ shed blood .
And the apostle Peter wrote : “ You [ anointed Christians ] know that it was not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from your forefathers . But it was with precious blood , like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb , even Christ’s . ” ​ — 1 Peter 1 : 18 , 19 .
Red grape wine undoubtedly was the kind Jesus used when instituting the Memorial .
The Memorial cup should contain unsweetened and unfortified red wine .
Why did Jesus not perform a miracle involving the Memorial bread and wine ?
Jesus still had his entire fleshly body and all his blood .
Therefore , the Memorial bread and wine are emblematic in nature , representing Christ’s flesh and blood .
*
The Memorial ​ — A Communion Meal
Why may more than one plate and one cup be used in the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal ?
This year , millions will assemble for the Lord’s Evening Meal in over 94,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide .
But the principle is maintained in large congregations by using several cups so that they can be passed through the audience in a reasonable amount of time .
Nothing in the Scriptures indicates that the cup or glass itself should be of some specific design .
However , it and the plate should reflect the dignity of the event .
It is wise to avoid filling a cup to the point that there is a danger of spilling the wine when it is passed .
Jehovah is involved in this communion meal as the Author of the arrangement .
Accordingly , Paul wrote : “ The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ ?
Yet , very few partake of the emblematic bread and wine .
Indeed , what should the Lord’s Evening Meal mean to you ?
• What is the significance of the unleavened Memorial bread ?
As shown in the preceding article , Jesus instituted this observance , also called the Lord’s Evening Meal , after he and his apostles celebrated the Passover on Nisan 14 , 33 C.E .
Some Observed It Unworthily
How were many Corinthian Christians conducting themselves at observances of the Lord’s Evening Meal ?
Many Corinthian Christians partook of the Memorial unworthily .
4 , 5 .
If a person who usually partakes of the Memorial emblems commits a serious sin , he should confess this to Jehovah and also seek the spiritual assistance of the older men of the congregation .
Should those now doing good to the remnant of the 144,000 brothers of Christ partake of the Lord’s Evening Meal ?
Since they are not Jesus ’ joint heirs with a heavenly hope , they attend the Memorial as respectful observers . ​ — Romans 6 : 3 - 5 .
Therefore , it would not have been difficult for such individuals to know that they were spirit - anointed and should partake of the Memorial emblems .
How was the identity of the “ great crowd ” clarified in 1935 , and how did this affect some who had been partaking of the Memorial emblems ?
Like ancient Israel’s alien residents who worshiped Jehovah and submitted to the Law , today’s other sheep accept Christian responsibilities , such as preaching the good news along with the members of spiritual Israel .
Just as no alien resident could become Israel’s king or a priest , however , none of these other sheep can as such rule in the heavenly Kingdom or serve as priests . ​ — Deuteronomy 17 : 15 .
For decades now , the search has been for other sheep , whose hope is earthly .
Anointed Christians are absolutely sure that they have the heavenly calling .
But what if some individuals who lack this call have been partaking of the Memorial emblems ?
Why might some mistakenly assume that they have the heavenly calling ?
Or they might desire the same destiny as a close friend who professes to be an anointed Christian .
Of course , God has not assigned anyone to recruit others for this privilege .
Am I ambitious for authority now or as a future joint heir with Christ ? ’
They display the humility expected of those having “ the mind of Christ . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 2 : 16 .
Some may have concluded that they have the heavenly calling because they have acquired considerable Bible knowledge .
God has an arrangement for providing spiritual food for all his people .
Christians with the earthly hope also do well in these respects .
How does God’s spirit bear witness with the spirit of anointed ones ?
“ You received a spirit of adoption as sons , ” wrote Paul , “ by which spirit we cry out : ‘ Abba , Father ! ’
The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children . If , then , we are children , we are also heirs : heirs indeed of God , but joint heirs with Christ , provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together . ”
Made operative by Christ’s shed blood , the new covenant took out not only from the Jews but also from the nations a people for Jehovah’s name and made them part of Abraham’s “ seed . ”
How can we derive great benefit from the Memorial season ?
Will you be among those who show gratitude for it by gathering after sundown on April 16 , 2003 , to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal ?

The reason for this was explained during a conference at the University of Heidelberg , Germany , in November 2000 .
What have they done in the face of such conflicts ?
Clemens Vollnhals
The result ?
Frieda carried on her Christian activities clandestinely , even helping to print the Watchtower magazine .
Prayer gave me strength and helped me not to become overly anxious . ” ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
Hundreds were arrested , including Frieda .
Frieda found herself back in court and was sentenced to six years in prison .
“ This time I was with fellow believers , and the association was a great help . ”
One example is Ádám Szinger .
In 1937 some Bible Students called at Ádám’s home , and he at once showed interest in their message .
What he learned from the Bible convinced him that the teachings of his church were not Biblical .
What helped him at 19 years of age to endure the suffering and the months in prison ?
In Serbia these prisoners were now under the control of Hitler’s Third Reich .
During the war , I went to prison and was deported to Serbia for the same reason .
He endured serial persecution under three regimes ​ — Fascists in prewar Hungary , German National Socialists in Serbia , and Communists in cold - war Hungary .
“ Bible study , prayer , and association with fellow believers were vital .
And second , I kept in mind Romans chapter 12 , which states : ‘ Do not avenge yourselves . ’
Yes , when it is allied with a strong faith in God .
[ Pictures on page 7 ]
Ádám Szinger at the time of his imprisonment and now
Such words were timely .
Today , true Christians are soon to cross into the promised new world and , like Joshua , need to be courageous .
The apostle John wrote : “ We know we originate with God , but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
When a Christian keeps his integrity , it is to a degree a defeat for Satan the Devil .
What warning did Jesus give , but what quality have true Christians displayed ?
Those words proved true in the first century , and they prove true today .
The courage of some schoolchildren is tested when they are called upon to recite a pledge of allegiance to the country or to the flag .
We also need courage when opposers maneuver the media into spreading bad reports about God’s servants or when they try to restrict true worship by scheming “ trouble by decree . ”
For example , how should we feel when newspaper , radio , or television reports about Jehovah’s Witnesses are distortions or outright falsehoods ?
We expect such things .
Paul , writing to Timothy , said : “ God gave us not a spirit of cowardice , but that of power . . .
Do not be afraid because of their faces , for ‘ I am with you to deliver you . ’ ”
If Jesus ’ disciples followed his example , they too would be conquerors . But they would need to “ take courage . ”
What resulted in Rome from Paul’s boldness ?
Indeed , any Christian can be courageous if he truly wants to do Jehovah’s will , if he is determined to remain faithful , if he constantly relies on God , and if he always remembers that Jehovah has previously strengthened countless individuals like him .
We are prepared to endure mockery or worse because we love him deeply . ​ — 1 John 2 : 5 ; 4 : 18 .
We are suffering for upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty , for doing good , and for being no part of the world .
Yes , our faith pleases our loving God , Jehovah , and brings honor to him .
Judges should be aware that the highest law is that of Jehovah God .
Why can we be happy if we have to endure persecution and slander ?
Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens ; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”

“ Those knowing your name will trust in you . ” ​ — PSALM 9 : 10 .
1 , 2 .
What are some things that people vainly trust in for security ?
The Bible says : “ The one trusting in his riches ​ — he himself will fall . ”
And eventually , they all die .
Such alliances were untrustworthy ​ — a lie .
They will not bring lasting security .
How did the report by Joshua and Caleb differ from that of the ten other spies ?
Soon after Israel’s liberation from Egypt , the nation was poised to enter Canaan , the Promised Land .
Only two , Joshua and Caleb , spoke favorably of Israel’s prospects in Canaan .
Only against Jehovah do not rebel ; and you , do not you fear the people of the land . ”
Why did Joshua and Caleb give a favorable report ?
They had seen his powerful acts in Egypt , at the Red Sea , and at the foot of Mount Sinai .
Why , decades later mere reports of those acts were enough to move Rahab of Jericho to risk her life for Jehovah’s people !
7 , 8 . ( a ) How does creation give us reasons to trust in Jehovah ?
Joshua and Caleb did so in part because they had seen demonstrations of his power .
Consider , for example , Jehovah’s works of creation , including the universe , with its billions of galaxies .
It is through the Bible that we come to know Jehovah by name and see the implications of his name .
A part of the process of paying the ransom was the resurrection of Jesus .
David faced the menace of King Saul , who wanted to kill him , and the powerful army of Philistines , who were trying to conquer Israel .
We too will be successful if we similarly trust in Jehovah .
But we know that today , opposers similarly ‘ sharpen their tongue , ’ using speech as a weapon of war .
They “ shoot ” at blameless Christians , using spoken or written words as “ arrows ” of misrepresentation .
Yes , though enemies sharpen their tongue against us , in the end ‘ their tongue comes to be against their own selves . ’
Through Rabshakeh , he pointed out ​ — correctly — ​ that trusting in Egypt for assistance would be futile .
What alone will help prepare us for any difficult circumstance in which we might find ourselves in this unstable world ?
In our case , the warfare is spiritual .
How do we demonstrate that we trust in Jehovah ?
However , we do not put our whole trust in such efforts , in that we do not view success or failure as hanging on our winning court cases or getting favorable publicity .
Does this mean that our trust in Jehovah has been misplaced ?
We are subjects of the Messianic Kingdom and are solidly on the side of Jehovah’s sovereignty .

Medical treatment may alleviate the suffering , and emotional support is vital .
Moreover , some who are experiencing such feelings have found additional help in the practical Bible - based publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses , as the following letter from France shows .
I have read these magazines regularly for over 15 years , but I never realized just how encouraging and stimulating the articles are .

Try to See Others as Jehovah Sees Them
1 , 2 .
He commanded the prophet to go to the house of a man named Jesse and anoint one of Jesse’s sons to be the future king of Israel .
( b ) What questions should we ask ourselves when we have a serious disagreement with a fellow believer ?
Perhaps you have had a serious quarrel with a Christian who was once a close friend .
What will help you to accomplish this ?
What desirable qualities does the individual possess ?
Have I been overlooking or undervaluing these traits ?
Why did we become friends in the first place ?
* Bad things were taking place in the land , but the Israelites were totally indifferent to them .
Yet , day after day Jonah faithfully carried out his commission to preach to them .
Sadistic torture was a frequent feature of their warfare .
When a violent storm threatened the mariners , what qualities did Jonah display ?
However , Jonah was willing to pay the ultimate price so that the sailors would not perish .
Do we not see displayed here the qualities of courage , humility , and love ?
When Jonah arrived in Nineveh , he courageously told its inhabitants that their great badness had come to God’s attention and that their city was going to be destroyed in 40 days .
After hearing Jonah’s straightforward message , the Ninevites repented , and their city was spared .
He examines the heart .
( b ) We are encouraged to maintain what view of the people to whom we preach the good news ?
( See box on page 18 . )
Centuries later , Jesus Christ made a positive statement about an event in Jonah’s life .
He said : “ Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights , so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights . ”
Are we not glad to serve a God who does not give up on his servants when they make mistakes ?
Indeed , this “ dust ” ​ — including imperfect people today — ​ can accomplish a great deal with the backing of God’s holy spirit !
Now let us briefly consider a second example , that of the apostle Peter .
Peter did manifest such traits at times .
Some might view this as evidence of a lack of modesty .
Peter was a spiritual man .
Why can it be said that Peter was truly loyal ?
Peter had another fine quality ​ — he was loyal .
Later , when a mob came to arrest the Master , most of his apostles fled .
One of the slaves of the high priest recognized him and accused him of having been with Jesus .
Yes , Peter denied his Master , but let us not forget that it was loyalty and concern for Jesus that put Peter in that dangerous situation , one that most of the apostles did not dare face . ​ — John 18 : 15 - 27 .
Why not try to settle the matter ?
Try to see the problem from his perspective .
Tell your brother what you appreciate about him .
How has this discussion helped you to see others as Jehovah sees them ?
It later became apparent that handsome Eliab did not have the makings of a suitable king of Israel .
When the Philistine giant Goliath challenged the Israelites in combat , Eliab , along with the other men of Israel , cowered in fear . ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 11 , 28 - 30 .
• What view of your Christian brothers are you determined to maintain ?
Think About How Others Appear to God
As you meditate on the Bible account of Jonah , do you see the need to take a fresh look at the people to whom you regularly preach the good news ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
That Law code , called the Mosaic Law , or simply “ the Law , ” was “ holy and righteous and good . ”
The Law also incited the Jews to love one another .
No .
When that One arrived , faithful Jews rejoiced .
Jesus promised that he would be with his followers “ all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ”
But some Jewish Christians were slow to grasp this vital truth .
As a result , they continued observing features of the Law even after Jesus ’ resurrection .
In doing so , they set a fine example for us today .
Instead of rigidly clinging to the Law , Peter adjusted his view .
Peter invited these men into the house and entertained them there .
Spiritual discernment .
Since God had shown his approval of uncircumcised Gentiles , pouring out his spirit upon them , Peter discerned that they could be accepted for baptism .
While acknowledging that Gentiles could become Jesus ’ followers , “ the supporters of circumcision ” insisted that these people of the non - Jewish nations must observe the Law in order to be saved .
What a test that must have been for those early Christians ​ — especially the Gentiles living in Jewish areas !
Why was it vital that the issue of circumcision be settled ?
An Honest Difference of Opinion ​ — Then , Unity !
What were some of the points that the governing body considered before making the decision regarding the status of Gentiles ?
At a meeting that was convened , some apparently argued in favor of circumcision , while others presented the opposing view .
These faithful men were determined to follow the Scriptures and the leadings of God’s holy spirit .
Those Christians who submitted to clear theocratic direction were blessed with a solid , Scriptural answer .
Why was it wrong to assert that observance of the Mosaic Law was necessary for salvation ?
In this , they were seriously mistaken .
For example , how could any Christian offer an animal sacrifice for the remission of sins ?
Christ’s sacrifice had made such offerings obsolete .
What guidance regarding the Law did Paul’s inspired letters provide ?
Guidance came , not in the form of a letter from the governing body , but in additional inspired letters written by the apostles .
In his letter to them , he explained that a real Jew “ is one on the inside , and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit . ”
He argued that a woman could not be married to two men at once .
How was it , then , that some Jewish Christians failed to get the point ?
They were also irregular in attendance at Christian meetings .
When Jehovah provides direction by means of his Word , his spirit , and his earthly organization , let us listen carefully .
If we do so , Jehovah will bless us with endless life that is both happy and satisfying .
When Peter visited Syrian Antioch , he enjoyed warm association with Gentile believers .
We can imagine how hurt those Gentile converts must have been when the respected apostle refused to eat with them . ​ — Galatians 2 : 11 - 13 .
How Would You Respond ?
• How do you account for differences in the ways Peter and “ supporters of circumcision ” responded to adjustments in understanding of the truth ?
News that he had been teaching that the Law had been set aside had reached the congregation .
The older men were afraid that newly converted Jewish Christians would be stumbled by Paul’s outspokenness on the subject of the Law and that they might conclude that Christians lacked respect for Jehovah’s arrangements .
There was nothing unscriptural about the arrangement for vows , and the temple had been used for pure worship , not for idolatry .
With a view to giving no cause for stumbling , then , Paul did as requested .
For some years , differing views of the Mosaic Law persisted among Christians
Many people will think of the much admired fresco in Milan , Italy , by the painter Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 - 1519 ) .
By comparison , though , none of those self - sacrificing deaths , laudable as they may have been , are anywhere near as significant as the death of Jesus Christ .
To answer that question and to help you find out what meaning the Lord’s Supper has for you , we invite you to read the following article .
DOES the Lord’s Supper have significant and lasting meaning for you ?
To the remaining 11 apostles , Jesus introduced “ the Lord’s evening meal . ”
It is also referred to as the Memorial , since Jesus commanded his followers : “ Do this as a memorial of me . ”
For generations to come , this memorial meal would remind observers of the profound meaning of what Jesus did that night , particularly of the symbols he used .
The wine in the cup also serves as a reminder that Jesus ’ shed blood would be the basis for providing “ forgiveness of sins , ” thus opening the way for the partakers to be called to heavenly life as joint heirs with Christ .
As “ a great crowd ” of faithful Christians “ rendering [ God ] sacred service day and night , ” they are delighted to be appreciative observers at the Lord’s Supper .
Their words and deeds in effect declare : “ Salvation we owe to our God , who is seated on the throne , and to the Lamb . ” ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 , 14 , 15 .
Consider , for example , when a couple celebrate their wedding anniversary or when a nation commemorates an important event in its history .
Interestingly , for several centuries after Christ , many professed Christians were called Quartodecimans , meaning “ Fourteenthers , ” because they commemorated Jesus ’ death once a year , on Nisan 14 .
Simple yet Profound
The apostle Paul explained that observing the Lord’s Supper would enable Jesus ’ disciples to “ keep proclaiming the death of the Lord . ”
The sacrificial death of our Lord Jesus Christ was made at enormous cost both to him and to his Father , Jehovah .
As a perfect man , Jesus did not face inherited death as we all do .
He could have gone on living forever .
Yet , Jesus willingly offered his perfect human life as a sacrifice so that “ through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death , that is , the Devil ; and that he might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through their lives . ”
The Memorial also reminds us of the greatest expression of love ever made by our heavenly Father , Jehovah .
How distressing for him , who “ is very tender in affection and compassionate , ” to hear and see the “ strong outcries and tears ” of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane , the sadistic scourging , the cruel impalement , and the slow , agonizing death .
Just the thought of it even now , centuries later , causes emotional pain to many .
However , on the basis of faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice , we can appeal to God for forgiveness .
What is more , we can entertain the prospect of living on a paradise earth for all eternity .
And Jehovah God’s provision of the ransom sacrifice ​ — made possible by Jesus ’ self - sacrificing love — ​ is indeed his “ indescribable free gift . ”
[ Box / Pictures on page 6 ]
Likewise , when The New Jerusalem Bible quotes Jesus as saying : “ This cup is the new covenant , ” we do not conclude that the cup itself was literally the new covenant .
Thus , the Charles B .
Yet , “ a mild tongue itself can break a bone , ” observed wise King Solomon .
Rather , out of his graciousness and his willingness not to be exacting or demanding ​ — expressions of mildness — ​ Jehovah provided the means through which sinful mankind can come to him and gain his favor .
Yes , by means of the gift of the ransom sacrifice of his Son , Jesus Christ , Jehovah makes it possible for us to approach his lofty throne without fear or dread . ​ — Romans 6 : 23 ; Hebrews 4 : 14 - 16 ; 1 John 4 : 9 , 10 , 18 .
How was mildness evident in God’s dealings with Cain ?
Long before Jesus came to earth , Jehovah’s mildness was manifested when Cain and Abel , Adam’s sons , presented sacrifices to God .
Mildness Attracts and Refreshes
Yet , most of the people were proud and indifferent , and they refused to believe .
To the common people , Jesus extended this warm invitation : “ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , and I will refresh you .
How those words brought comfort and refreshment to those who were downtrodden and oppressed !
What quality is linked with mildness , and how is Jesus a fine example in this regard ?
Pride , on the other hand , leads to self - exaltation and may often cause one to treat others in a harsh and callous way .
Jesus demonstrated humility throughout his earthly ministry .
Far from it !
Jehovah , the almighty God , displays an abundance of dynamic energy and power .
Yet , he maintained mildness of temper when dealing with the shortcomings of his disciples , and he patiently bore their weaknesses .
“ In fact , [ Moses ] was powerful in his words and deeds . ”
At Meribah , near Kadesh , he neglected to direct glory to Jehovah , the Miracle Worker .
Harshness Versus Mildness
16 , 17 .
Nabal’s harshness ultimately led to his death .
( b ) What can help us make an effective self - examination ?
One Bible translation renders this exhortation ‘ set your heart on . ’
( New Testament in Modern English , by J .
They will mold and guide you . ​ — James 1 : 21 .
( a ) Why should we pursue mildness ?
“ Let him show out of his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom . ”
The following article presents helpful guidance .
[ Picture on page 17 ]
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Admittedly , it is not easy , for we have inherited from our first human parents selfish desires and temperaments that do not conform to Christ’s example .
But relying on sheer willpower is not enough .

Godly mildness is part of the fruitage of the holy spirit .
Mildness of temper lightens the atmosphere and offers a welcome contrast to the bickering and contention that blight many families .
Wise King Solomon wrote : “ An answer , when mild , turns away rage , but a word causing pain makes anger to come up . ” ​ — Proverbs 15 : 1 .
How can displaying mildness strengthen the bonds between parents and children ?
The relationship between parents and children can be strained , especially when love for Jehovah is lacking .
But in all Christian households , there is a need for exhibiting mildness .
Paul counseled fathers : “ Do not be irritating your children , but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah . ”
He was also our friend , and we didn’t want to let him down . ”
Mildness truly helps reinforce the bonds between parents and children .
In Our Ministry
Why is manifesting mildness in the field ministry vital ?
Another area where mildness is important is in the field ministry .
As we share the Kingdom good news with others , we meet people with different dispositions .
Others , for a variety of reasons , may react unfavorably .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts , always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you , but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect . ”
This course of conduct often produces remarkable results .
“ Over the next two years , we listened a lot to what other Witnesses said , ” they later observed .
The Witness met the couple years later and found that they were now his spiritual brother and sister .
Harold’s experiences as a soldier caused him to become bitter and to doubt God’s existence .
But one day , a Witness named Bill set out to visit an interested person who lived just two doors away from Harold .
By mistake , Bill knocked at Harold’s door .
He studied the Bible , made progress , and became a baptized servant of Jehovah .
What worldly traits should members of the Christian congregation resist ?
Confrontation is commonplace in today’s society .
Paul warned Timothy to be on guard against brothers who resembled vessels for “ a purpose lacking honor . ”
“ A slave of the Lord does not need to fight , ” Paul reasoned , “ but needs to be gentle toward all , qualified to teach , keeping himself restrained under evil , instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed . ”
He thus avoided an overbearing , dictatorial attitude .
16 , 17 .
His calm manner is comforting .
Even when there is initial resistance to counsel , mildness on the part of the one who offers help may break down any reluctance to follow sound Scriptural advice . ​ — Proverbs 25 : 15 .
Admittedly , the way some in authority act betrays harshness and a lack of fellow feeling .
We heed Paul’s counsel to “ be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities as rulers , to be ready for every good work , to speak injuriously of no one , not to be belligerent , to be reasonable , exhibiting all mildness toward all men . ” ​ — Titus 3 : 1 , 2 .
As for the “ great crowd ” of “ other sheep , ” they continue to manifest mildness and look forward to life in Paradise here on earth .
Mildness is especially important in a religiously divided home
Make a defense with mildness and deep respect
Touched by what they read in the Gospel accounts regarding what took place that night , many have endeavored to commemorate the Lord’s Supper in various ways .
All of this is understandable , since Jesus Christ himself commanded that his followers observe this event and that they do so regularly .
Therefore , we encourage young ones to study this material carefully and to comment freely when it is considered at the congregation Watchtower Study .
The garment , while attractive , is cheaply made .
Furthermore , ungodly conduct has a high price tag .
Protection From “ the Wicked One ”
Are you one of these faithful youths ?
He knew that the course of integrity would not be easy for his followers , regardless of their age .
The Bible says that this evil spirit creature “ walks about like a roaring lion , seeking to devour someone . ” ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 8 .
Throughout history , Satan has taken sadistic delight in bringing the cruelest of atrocities upon humans .
Consider the horrific calamities that Satan brought upon Job and his family .
The Devil is on the prowl , and in his quest to devour , he shows no mercy to youths .
At the turn of the first century C.E . , for instance , Herod hatched a scheme to have put to death all boys in Bethlehem who were two years of age or younger .
His sole intention is to devour as many humans as possible .
( a ) How does Jehovah stand out in stark contrast with Satan ?
He is the very epitome of love .
In fact , this grand quality so characterizes our Creator that the Bible says : “ God is love . ”
On the contrary , he is watching over you because of the wicked one .
What is it ?
You probably thought long and hard about what type of gift would be appropriate for that person .
Now consider this question : What kind of gift can you offer your Creator , Jehovah God ?
As you likely know from your study of the Bible , it is Satan the Devil who taunts Jehovah .
He asserts that any who serve God do so , not out of love , but for selfish reasons .
Do you see your role in this vital issue ?
Imagine ​ — the Universal Sovereign is calling upon you to share in addressing the greatest issue of all time .
So did Jesus as well as countless others throughout history , including many youths .
11 , 12 .
Still , Jehovah wants you to take his side on the issue of sovereignty because he cares about you as an individual .
Clearly , Jehovah is interested in the course you choose .
More than that , he is affected by it .
On the other hand , when you do what is right , Jehovah’s heart rejoices .
The blessings that come from serving Jehovah are not to be experienced only in the future .
For example , the Bible says that those who have developed a love for money “ have stabbed themselves all over with many pains . ”
The Bible describes Jehovah as “ the happy God . ”
He wants you to be happy too .
I have a healthy body because of abstaining from smoking and drugs .
• How does the Bible show that Jehovah cares about you ?
• What are some blessings that come from serving Jehovah ?
“ I became envious of the boasters , when I would see the very peace of wicked people . ” ​ — Psalm 73 : 2 , 3 .
At the latest , they will experience a fall when Jehovah destroys this ungodly system . ​ — Revelation 21 : 8 .
How do the Bible books of Hebrews and Malachi show that Jehovah appreciates your service ?
It can hurt deeply when a generous act is taken for granted or , worse yet , completely forgotten .
Think about what that means .
What an appreciative God ! ​ — Malachi 3 : 10 .
You have a special opportunity to worship and serve this grateful God .
Since there are only about six million of your fellow believers compared with some six billion people worldwide , your privilege is a rare one indeed .
Furthermore , the fact that you are listening and responding to the message of the good news is evidence that Jehovah takes a personal interest in you .
This is something that you should never take for granted .
In addition , Jehovah sees your efforts and demonstrates his appreciation for your faithfulness .
A righteous prophet in ancient Israel stated : “ As regards Jehovah , his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 16 : 9 .
( b ) Why might talking to others about your faith seem difficult ?
6 , 7 . ( a ) How was one 17 - year - old girl able to witness to her classmates ?
The girls at my table happened to be discussing religion , and one of the girls asked me what religion I belonged to , ” she says .
Apparently , they had the notion that Jehovah’s Witnesses were strange people .
“ I felt very good about it when the lunch period was over , ” she says .
Jehovah will help you .
Nehemiah was visibly distressed because he had been informed about the plight of the Jews and had learned that the wall and gates of Jerusalem were in ruins .
“ Ready to Make a Defense ”
Over the next few weeks , Leah placed 23 copies of the Young People Ask book with her schoolmates and their friends .
Was it easy for Leah to speak up when others initially inquired about the book she was reading ?
Leah’s experience may remind you of a similar situation that confronted a young Israelite girl who had been taken captive to Syria .
Naaman , a Syrian army chief , was a leper .
Jehovah certainly blessed the courage of that little girl .
“ I was glad , ” Leah says , “ because I knew that I was helping others to learn more about Jehovah and helping them to change their life . ”
Follow the admonition of Peter , who wrote that as a Christian you should always be “ ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you , but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect . ”
You may be surprised at the results .
What opportunities have some youths taken advantage of to give a witness ?
Many youths have explained their faith to schoolmates or teachers by using videos .
Remember , as a Christian youth , you have something that your peers sorely need ​ — the best way of life now and the promise of everlasting life for the future .
Interestingly , in the United States ​ — where you might think that people in general are apathetic or secular - minded — ​ one poll revealed that fully half of the youths take religion very seriously , and a third say that religious faith is “ the most important influence ” in their life .
It may well be , then , that your peers at school would be glad to listen to what you have to say about the Bible .
The apostle John wrote : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ”
You will find this to be true if you draw close to Jehovah .
Even if you suffer some opposition , of what can you be confident ?
The blessings that come from serving Jehovah are long - lasting ​ — indeed , everlasting .
Indeed , he will never “ forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ” ​ — Hebrews 6 : 10 .
Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Do You Recall ?
Even the Very Young Praise Jehovah !
Even preteens have been able to give a witness at school .
Consider these experiences .
“ Why don’t you read a story to the class ? ”
Nine - year - old Whitney is grateful for the brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education .
Jehoash had Zechariah stoned .
Instead of ending up like King Jehoash , all who follow this advice will have a blessed future : “ May loving - kindness and trueness themselves not leave you . . . .
Some of these are content with simply having some form of religion .
( b ) What is implied by the Scriptural question , “ Where is Jehovah ? ”
On matters that affect our lives , he provides a sound basis for us to determine his position , that is , how he views such matters and whether our desires are in harmony with his purposes .
When still a young man , David , the son of Jesse , developed strong faith in Jehovah .
David had personally experienced Jehovah’s protection .
Impelled by faith and by love for “ the name of Jehovah , ” David slew the heavily armed Philistine giant Goliath .
He continued to pray : “ Make me know your own ways , O Jehovah ; teach me your own paths .
Make me walk in your truth and teach me , for you are my God of salvation . In you I have hoped all day long . ”
The king acknowledged his need for Jehovah’s help .
Did Jehovah let himself be found on that occasion ?
How can you be certain that Jehovah will also let himself be found by you when you turn to him for direction ?
He invites people of all nations to seek him in prayer .
Yet , when the heart of a person is not submissive to God , that person’s prayers are in vain .
They Asked but Did Not Receive
What was wrong with the way Johanan sought Jehovah’s direction , and what do we learn from his error ?
Our entire way of life is involved .
But he neglected to search adequately to ascertain Jehovah’s will on the matter .
David later acknowledged : “ Jehovah our God broke through against us , for we did not search after him according to the custom . ” ​ — 1 Chronicles 13 : 1 - 3 ; 15 : 11 - 13 ; Numbers 4 : 4 - 6 , 15 ; 7 : 1 - 9 .
When the Ark was finally transported by the Levites from the house of Obed - edom to Jerusalem , a song composed by David was sung .
But in the matter of his own marital affairs , Solomon failed to search for Jehovah .
No matter how prominent , wise , or knowledgeable we may seem to be , it is important to “ keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord ” !
When Zerah the Ethiopian came against Judah , why could Asa pray with confidence that Jehovah would deliver Judah ?
Would Jehovah deliver Judah ?
Over 500 years earlier , Jehovah had clearly stated what his people could expect if they listened to him and kept his commandments and what they could expect if they did not .
At the beginning of his reign , Asa had removed from his realm altars and pillars used in false worship .
He had urged the people “ to search for Jehovah . ”
The outcome ?
Judah was given a resounding victory . ​ — 2 Chronicles 14 : 2 - 12 .
( b ) When Asa acted unwisely , what help was given him , but how did he react ?
( c ) How can we benefit from considering Asa’s conduct ?
With renewed zeal , Asa promoted true worship .
Elihu reminded him : “ No one has said , ‘ Where is God my Grand Maker ? ’ ”
Jehovah answered by showing that his spirit was now on Elisha .
Those who were then entrusted with oversight examined the Scriptures and prayed to Jehovah for direction .
• Why do some prayers for divine direction go unanswered ?
• What Bible examples illustrate the need to “ keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord ” ?
Help to the Christian brotherhood has been provided by the faithful and discreet slave class .
As time went by , doctors began to take note of this service .
Remegio said : “ The doctors started asking questions , but I found myself stymied because the questions were very technical . ”
However , the brother was firm in his stand .
Why is the comfort provided by Jehovah unique ?
Some individuals and organizations endeavor to provide comfort .
Physical relief efforts help to meet short - term needs .
( b ) How does Jehovah help us to discern when the relief will come ?
Jesus ’ description matches the times we are living in . ​ — Matthew 24 : 3 - 14 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 .
Comfort to a People in Distress
He reminded them of the kind of God he is .
Jehovah caused his prophets to use vivid contrasts between him as the true and living God and idols , which could help neither themselves nor their worshipers .
On occasion , Jehovah gave comfort by specifying a time , near or distant , when his people would be delivered .
As the deliverance from Egypt drew near , he told the oppressed Israelites : “ One plague more I am going to bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt . After that he will send you away from here . ”
When a three - nation alliance invaded Judah in the days of King Jehoshaphat , Jehovah told them that He would intervene in their behalf “ tomorrow . ”
At Luke 2 : 25 , we read : “ Look ! there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon , and this man was righteous and reverent , waiting for Israel’s consolation [ or , comfort ; actually , the coming of the Messiah ] , and holy spirit was upon him . ”
As Jesus Christ carried out his earthly ministry , he did not always provide the help that the people thought they needed .
Some longed for a Messiah who would free them from the hated yoke of Rome .
He gave suffering individuals renewed reason to live by restoring sight and speech , curing disabled limbs , cleansing fellow Israelites of loathsome diseases , and relieving them of other grievous sicknesses .
He brought great relief to grieving family members by raising their children from the dead .
What is made possible as a result of Jesus ’ sacrifice ?
And yet , if anyone does commit a sin , we have a helper with the Father , Jesus Christ , a righteous one . And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins , yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s . ”
The miraculous gifts of the spirit also helped to make clear that God had transferred his favor from fleshly Israel to the Christian congregation .
And the spirit strengthened the members of that congregation to be bold and fearless witnesses . ​ — Acts 4 : 31 .
However , many Christians have come under pressure that is extremely severe .
In modern times , some have been hounded by mobs and thrown into concentration camps , prisons , and labor camps under inhuman conditions .
Pressure may also be experienced by a mature Christian who helps one fellow believer after another to deal with difficult situations .
In such cases , the one who gives encouragement may also be in need of receiving it .
Did David receive help ?
God saw that Jesus received the support that he needed during that difficult time . ​ — Luke 22 : 41 - 44 .
So vicious was the persecution of Christians after the founding of the first - century congregation that all except the apostles were dispersed from Jerusalem .
Men and women were physically dragged from their homes .
In Macedonia he was beaten with rods .
What are we going to consider in the next article ?
• Why is the comfort from God of greatest value ?
• What comfort is provided through Christ ?
Jesus provided comfort by teaching , by healing , and by resurrecting the dead
We also show love to those outside the congregation , even to those who may not have given evidence of any love for us in the past . ​ — Matthew 5 : 43 - 48 ; Galatians 6 : 10 .
Modern - day anointed Christians have long recognized that this commission also applies to them , and the “ other sheep ” gladly join them in that work . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
The Bible clearly answers that question .
Young people , as well as older ones , need comfort .
A depressed teenager in Poland asked an acquaintance for advice .
Why do people suffer ?
Why is my heart not healthy ?
In view of this , we can explain at a suitable time what God’s Kingdom is , and we can show from the Bible how it will solve present problems .
( 1 ) The comfort found in the Bible is from Jehovah , the true God .
When doing so , they have emphasized the expression “ the comfort we get also abounds through the Christ . ”
This scripture may help a person to realize that the Bible is a source of comfort to which he ought to give more consideration .
If you have lived through years of warfare , how can the cited scriptures comfort you ?
But most of them never succeed in doing that , and a number who have tried have lost their lives in the attempt .
The prophecy at Matthew 24 : 3 , 7 , 14 or 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 might help them to see the bigger picture and the meaning of the conditions they are enduring , namely , that we are living in the conclusion of the old system of things .
What texts comforted a woman in West Africa , and why ?
Her life came to be filled with fear , sadness , and heartbreaking disappointment .
All such can be comforted to know that God assures relief for those who trust in him and guarantees a righteous world in which people will enjoy the work of their hands .
When a Witness in one Asian land heard a customer express anxious concern over the economic situation there , she explained that what was happening there was part of a pattern of events occurring around the world .
( b ) If people feel that bad conditions prove that there is no God , how might you endeavor to reason with them ?
When people have suffered for many years or have been disappointed by many hollow promises , they may be like the Israelites in Egypt who “ out of discouragement ” did not listen .
Some may view the bad conditions they live under as proof that there is no God or that he does not care about them .
Disaster may strike as a result of a storm , an earthquake , a fire , or an explosion .
Grief may be widespread .
After a terrorist attack in one country , many were left in a state of shock .
Many deeply appreciated the concern .
When disaster struck a region in El Salvador , why was the field service of local Witnesses very effective ?
In some areas , events prophesied for the last days cause great suffering .
When there has been a death in a family , what might you say or do to bring comfort ?
At a suitable time , offer to share some encouraging thoughts from the Bible .
You can read together the Bible’s promises regarding the resurrection .
( b ) How can you give comfort to someone who already knows the Scriptures well ?
Being a true comforter implies making yourself available to those who are grieving . ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
What if the person you want to comfort already knows what the Bible says about death , the ransom , and the resurrection ?
Do not feel that you need to give a speech .
• What might we do to help others to benefit fully from the comfort that the Bible offers ?

John beheld the glorified Jesus Christ , who “ holds the seven stars in his right hand ” and who “ walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands , ” or congregations .
The “ stars ” are “ the angels of the seven congregations . ”
How do elders benefit from paying attention to what Christ says to the congregations ?
By heeding his words to each of the seven congregations , present - day elders see how they can handle similar situations .
Of course , all Christians need to listen to God’s Son .
What kind of city was Ephesus ?
To maintain the purity of Jehovah’s worship and to protect the congregation , therefore , they do not extend the hand of fellowship to unrepentant apostates . ​ — Galatians 2 : 4 , 5 ; 2 John 8 - 11 .
We ourselves must guard against losing our first love for God .
Christ urged the Ephesians : “ Remember from what you have fallen , and repent and do the former deeds . ”
What if they did not do this ?
As zealous Christians , may we therefore work hard to keep the congregation shining spiritually . ​ — Matthew 5 : 14 - 16 .
What will be the experience of those who heed what the spirit says ?
So we should pay attention to what God now says through him by holy spirit .
Under the spirit’s direction , Jesus promised : “ To him that conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life , which is in the paradise of God . ”
14 , 15 .
And instead of a fading garland of flowers worn as a crown by victors in the pagan games , Christ promises resurrected anointed ones “ the crown of life ” as immortal creatures in heaven .
Then let us help fellow believers to focus on the main reason why God permits persecution ​ — the issue of universal sovereignty .
Both commendation and correction were given to the congregation in Pergamum .
In Pergamum there was an altar dedicated to Zeus .
Jehovah God and Jesus Christ certainly remember such loyal servants . ​ — 1 John 5 : 21 .
Greedy for material gain , the false prophet Balaam tried to curse Israel .
Sectarians want to do Christians spiritual harm , and those bent on promoting divisions and sects will not inherit God’s Kingdom .
• Reflecting on the situation in the congregation in Pergamum , how should we view apostate thinking ?

Persecuted Christians are world conquerors
How can we benefit from what he said by holy spirit to the four other congregations ?
Where was Thyatira , and for what product was it especially noted ?
Lydia , who became a Christian during Paul’s visit to Philippi in Greece , was “ a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira . ” ​ — Acts 16 : 12 - 15 .
Jesus commends the congregation in Thyatira for its good deeds , love , faith , endurance , and work in the ministry .
In fact , ‘ their deeds of late were more than those formerly . ’
Overseers dare not yield to such wicked teaching and influence , and no Christian needs to commit spiritual and physical fornication or to engage in idolatry in order to realize that the “ deep things of Satan ” are totally evil .
Christ’s spirit - inspired message to the congregation helps godly women to keep their God - assigned place today .
( Read Revelation 3 : 1 - 6 . )
According to the historian Josephus , Sardis had a large Jewish community in the first century B.C.E .
Christ told the angel of the Sardis congregation : “ I know your deeds , that you have the name that you are alive , but you are dead . ”
The wonderful service privileges awaiting them in heaven spur them on to conquer this world .
Christ “ has the key of David , ” and he has thus been entrusted with all Kingdom interests and the administration of the household of faith .
( a ) What promise did Jesus give the congregation in Philadelphia ?
( b ) How can we keep from falling during “ the hour of test ” ?
This is necessary if they want to be pillars in the glorified heavenly temple and if they are to bear the name of God’s city as its heavenly citizens and share the name of Christ as his bride .
To the Angel in Laodicea
Christ reproved the complacent congregation in Laodicea .
Some 90 miles [ 150 km ] east of Ephesus and situated at the junction of major trade routes in the fertile valley of the Lycus River , Laodicea was a very prosperous manufacturing city and banking center .
Garments made from the black wool of the region were widely known .
Because they were lukewarm , Christ was going to vomit them out of his mouth .
Nearby Hierapolis had hot springs , and Colossae had cold water .
18 , 19 .
The Laodiceans sought earthly riches and ‘ did not know that they were miserable , pitiable , poor , blind , and naked . ’
20 , 21 .
If so , Christ will feast with them to their great spiritual benefit .
To each conquering anointed one , Christ will grant the privilege of ‘ sitting down with him on his throne , even as he conquered and sat down with his Father on His throne . ’
And the conquering other sheep look forward to a wonderful place on earth under Kingdom rule .
22 , 23 . ( a ) How can all Christians benefit from Jesus ’ words to the seven congregations ?
All of us can continue to benefit from various features of the counsel Christ gave to the seven congregations , as long as we apply it prayerfully and without delay .

[ Footnote ]
• Why were the Laodiceans reproved , but what prospects are set before zealous Christians ?

Jesus has set before his followers “ a large door ” that leads to Kingdom privileges
Over 200 years ago , Samuel Johnson , the English essayist , wrote : “ You are much surer that you are doing good when you pay money to those who work , as the recompense of their labour , than when you give money merely in charity . ”
Consider two recent examples .
In Britain , organizers of a major television charity event were embarrassed when it was discovered that out of 6.5 million pounds ( about $ 10 million , U.S . ) sent in to help build new orphanages in Romania , only 12 substandard houses were ever built , and hundreds of thousands of dollars went unaccounted for .
To Give or Not to Give
Giving That Pleases God
However , Jesus answered : “ Let her alone . . . .
At Luke 8 : 1 - 3 , for example , we are told that Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Susanna , and others used “ their belongings ” in quietly ministering to Jesus and his apostles .
Although these men were not destitute , they had abandoned their means of livelihood to focus their efforts exclusively on the ministry .
She made clothes for needy widows in her seaside town of Joppa .
Nonetheless , her good work endeared her to those she could help , as well as to God , who mercifully blessed her goodwill . ​ — Acts 9 : 36 - 41 .
She was living alone and had no family to help her .
In fact , Jesus and his apostles kept a common fund for the poor , and they accepted contributions from caring people they met in their work .
Likewise , first - century congregations took up collections when the need arose and organized relief on a larger scale . ​ — Acts 2 : 44 , 45 ; 6 : 1 - 3 ; 1 Timothy 5 : 9 , 10 .
He personally organized a collection and used approved men to deliver it .
Jehovah’s Witnesses today are also quick to help when disaster strikes .
During the summer of 2001 , for instance , torrential storms caused major flooding in Houston , Texas , U.S.A .
Some charities have high administrative or fund - raising costs , leaving only a small portion of the collected money for the intended purpose .
So it is the course of wisdom to examine the facts carefully .
There is a kind of giving that is even more important than charity .
Shortly before his death , he told Pilate : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . ”
Why not listen to what Jehovah’s Witnesses have to say the next time they call ?
“ Do not be afraid or be terrified . . . .
TERRORISM !
It awakens mixed emotions of horror , grief , and anger .
Jehovah’s Witnesses , who are actively preaching in 234 lands and territories of the earth , are remarkably optimistic .
In fact , think of the uncertainty of life itself !
Although this scripture paints a bleak picture , it nonetheless points to hope .
In view of the magnitude and global scope of terrorism , nations around the earth quickly banded together to combat it .
How successful such efforts will be remains to be seen .
Jehovah’s Witnesses are well - known for their political neutrality .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What does political neutrality on the part of Jehovah’s Witnesses not mean , and why ?
The neutral stand taken by Jehovah’s Witnesses should not be misunderstood to mean that they support or condone acts of violence .
They have learned how Jehovah feels about violence .
The psalmist wrote : “ Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one , and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates . ”
Since terrorism is so evil , however , should not Jehovah’s Witnesses be doing something to help combat it ?
First of all , they refrain from any such activity themselves .
Fearless in the Face of Imminent Attack
Since the God of peace hates violence , we can understand why he has initiated steps to destroy its root cause , Satan the Devil .
12 , 13 . ( a ) What is significant about the year 1914 ?
Since then , world conditions have steadily worsened .
Further , [ Jehoshaphat ] took counsel with the people and stationed singers to Jehovah and those offering praise in holy adornment as they went out ahead of the armed men , and saying : ‘ Give praise to Jehovah , for to time indefinite is his loving - kindness . ’ ”
Yes , even in the face of enemy attack , the people continued actively praising Jehovah .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What positive attitude do Jehovah’s Witnesses today have as regards Gog’s attack ?
What an opportune time to praise Jehovah courageously !
To highlight the superiority of choosing such a life course , the tract Youths ​ — What Will You Do With Your Life ?
They also find comfort in knowing that the resurrection will restore to life many who have lost their lives through violence .
As true Christians , we appreciate the need for maintaining Christian neutrality and are determined to do so .
We want to hold on to the marvelous prospect of being able to “ stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah . ”
Thousands of young Witnesses have joyfully taken up the full - time ministry
TERRORISM has been described by some as an attack on the world community , even on civilization itself .
On the other hand , of even greater consequence is another attack , to which the world community gives little or no attention .
What is it ?
Conflict between God’s now ruling King and Satan’s wicked system has been ongoing ever since God’s Kingdom was established in the heavens in 1914 .
Resistance to Kingdom rule will clearly reach its climax during the attack by Gog of Magog .
We may wonder how humans can fight against an invisible , heavenly government .
The King Completes His Conquest
And Jesus stated emphatically that he counts what people do or fail to do to his anointed brothers as being done or not done to him . ​ — Matthew 25 : 40 , 45 .
Carrying “ palm branches in their hands , ” they hail Jehovah as rightful Sovereign of the universe , whose rulership is expressed through the reign of his enthroned King , Jesus Christ , “ the Lamb of God . ” ​ — John 1 : 29 , 36 .
What will Gog’s attack cause Christ to do , with what result ?
Gog’s attack will cause God’s enthroned King to take action and wage the war of Armageddon .
During the upcoming great tribulation , culminating in Armageddon , Christ will war against all evil .
When they turned their faces toward the crowd , why , there they were , their carcasses fallen to the earth without anyone escaping . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 20 : 22 - 24 .
It was exactly as Jehovah had foretold : “ You will not need to fight . ”
This sets the pattern for Christians to follow when Jesus Christ moves in “ to complete his conquest . ”
Who Will Lead Gog’s Attack ?
They are no longer identified with the sea of humanity alienated from God , and they are looking forward to ruling with Christ Jesus in the heavenly Kingdom .
How Will God’s Servants React ?
What does it mean for Jehovah’s people to take their position ?
Your right hand , O Jehovah , can shatter an enemy .
You in your loving - kindness have led the people whom you have recovered ; you in your strength will certainly conduct them to your holy abiding place . . . .
• How will God’s people take their position ?
• What does it mean to stand still ?
• How will God’s people see the salvation of Jehovah ?
Is it wrong to take the life of a very sick or old pet ?
Would it be wrong to put such animals out of their misery , to put them to sleep ?
Cruel treatment of them is certainly against the will of God , for his Word states : “ The righteous one is caring for the soul of his domestic animal . ”
When God created humans , he showed that there was a clear distinction between them and animals .
Similarly , Psalm 8 : 6 - 8 says : “ Everything you [ God ] have put under his [ man’s ] feet : small cattle and oxen , all of them , and also the beasts of the open field , the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea . ”
God made it clear that animals could be properly used and killed by man .
This does not authorize the wanton killing of animals for sport .
Thus , while man has dominion over animals , he should not abuse that authority but use it in harmony with the principles of God’s Word .
They are called cosmos and are native to the American tropics .
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field , how they are growing ; they do not toil , nor do they spin ; but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 28 , 29 .
Jesus , however , went on to compare it with common vegetation , saying : “ If , now , God thus clothes the vegetation of the field , which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , will he not much rather clothe you , you with little faith ? ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 30 .
But do you know what God’s Kingdom is and what it will do for mankind ?
“ There is no partiality with God . ” ​ — ROMANS 2 : 11 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What was Jehovah’s purpose regarding the Canaanites in general ?
A challenge lay ahead , beyond the Jordan River .
And how can we imitate him ?
With Jehovah’s help the Israelites defeated him and his people at Hormah .
Og was killed at Edrei .
What Canaanite Rahab heard of Jehovah’s actions stirred her to act in faith .
Like Rahab , they had heard of Jehovah’s deliverance of his people at the Exodus and at the defeat of Sihon and Og .
Joshua concluded a covenant with them that ensured their survival .
Canaanite Rahab and her family , as well as the Gibeonites , feared Jehovah and acted accordingly .
How is Jehovah’s impartiality shown in his dealings with Abraham and with the nation of Israel ?
Abraham’s faith and love for Jehovah brought blessings to his descendants .
During his earthly ministry , Jesus , who is the exact representation of his Father , imitated Jehovah’s impartiality .
In contrast , the proud and haughty despised Jesus and his message .
Then , using a play on words involving the term “ Jew ” ( meaning “ of Judah , ” that is , lauded or praised ) , Paul added : “ The praise of that one comes , not from men , but from God . ”
Revelation 7 : 9 offers what prospect , and to whom ?
Individuals from all backgrounds have the prospect of surviving the coming “ great tribulation ” and drinking from “ fountains of waters of life ” in the new world . ​ — Revelation 7 : 14 - 17 .
13 - 15 . ( a ) How can we overcome racial and cultural differences ?
( b ) Cite examples of the benefits that showing friendliness can bring .
He soon sought opportunities to share in spreading the Kingdom good news to others in that district .
Indeed , one day when Aklilu’s preaching companion asked him what goals he now had in life , Aklilu readily responded that he hoped someday to be part of a congregation that spoke his language , Amharic .
Overcoming Prejudice
16 - 18 .
Any prejudice we may once have felt toward certain nationalities , races , or cultures can be overcome .
It is easy to feel close to those whom we know well .
In what areas of life should we imitate Jehovah , our impartial God ?
• How did Jesus demonstrate impartiality in his teaching ?
[ Picture on page 16 ]
[ Picture on page 16 ]
“ Do remember me , O my God , for good . ” ​ — NEHEMIAH 13 : 31 .
AFTER many cloudy and gray days , sunshine brings a welcome change .
Likewise , following long periods of blazing sunshine and dry weather , a shower of rain ​ — even a cloudburst — ​ provides refreshment and relief .
His servants should strive to imitate him by looking for the good in others .
On what basis does Jehovah act with goodness ?
Let us consider answers to this question in four areas of life : ( 1 ) the Christian ministry , ( 2 ) the family , ( 3 ) the congregation , and ( 4 ) our relationships with others .
“ The field is the world , ” Jesus explained in answer to his disciples ’ queries about the meaning of the parable of the wheat and the weeds .
As Christ’s modern - day disciples , we recognize this truth when engaging in our ministry .
Our next visit to the home when we preach in that area may provide an opportunity to speak directly to the person who curtailed the earlier visit .
What can help us to be positive when we approach people ?
9 , 10 .
Yes , despite having been the victim of their hatred , Joseph acted in their best interests .
What a wonderful expression of enduring love Jacob there demonstrated !
11 , 12 . ( a ) What prophetic example emphasizes the importance of looking for the good within the family ?
Jehovah’s long - suffering in dealing with the faithless nation of Israel provides further insight into how he looks for the good in his people .
Hosea declared : “ Afterwards the sons of Israel will come back and certainly look for Jehovah their God , and for David their king ; and they will certainly come quivering to Jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days . ”
Surely this is a fine example on which to reflect when faced with family difficulties .
What is one way to practice the kingly law of love within the Christian congregation ?
As Christians , we aim to practice the kingly law of love .
Indeed , some who attend a Christian meeting for the very first time remark : “ Everyone was so friendly .
It seemed as though everyone knew me already .
How can young ones in the congregation be helped to show an interest in the older ones ?
The way in which youths interact with older ones in the congregation and the way they take care of simple chores at home will indicate that they can likely care well for greater responsibilities later on in life . ​ — Luke 16 : 10 .
Heavenly wisdom dictates that elders avoid partiality when judging matters in the congregation .
James declared : “ The wisdom from above is first of all chaste , then peaceable , reasonable , ready to obey , full of mercy and good fruits , not making partial distinctions , not hypocritical . ”
“ In the middle of the gods [ “ godlike ones , ” footnote , referring to human judges ] he judges : ‘ How long will you keep on judging with injustice and showing partiality to the wicked themselves ? ’ ”
In what ways can we look for the good in others ?
We will be more inclined to cover over the faults of others when we look for the good in them .
“ What is looked for in stewards , ” wrote Paul , “ is for a man to be found faithful . ”
We are thus drawn closer to them , strengthening the bonds of Christian friendship .
What blessings will come to those who look for the good in all ?

Despite his brothers ’ earlier hatred toward him , Joseph looked for their good
she wondered .
Her peers reasoned : “ It is a common custom .
“ I have to admit that in my first year of studies , I participated in the collection of money , ” acknowledges Katarzyna .
Katarzyna says : “ I understood how easy it is to succumb to peer pressure .
“ On the other hand , many respect my point of view , which makes me glad . ”
Would You Welcome a Visit ?
Jesus Christ , who had a profound understanding of and a special fondness for humans , put love for God and neighbor at the very heart of his teaching .
The following article will address these questions .
HOW does a human learn to love ?
Hardly .
Genuine love is more than just affection or sentiment .
Worldwide , people have found the Bible to be a great help in setting such family standards , providing living evidence that the Bible truly “ is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight , for disciplining in righteousness . ”
Conversely , in a home with double , flawed , or loose standards , children may become exasperated , angry , and rebellious . ​ — Romans 2 : 21 ; Colossians 3 : 21 .
Yes , Jehovah , the very personification of love , instructs us for our benefit ​ — not because he wants to restrict our freedom with needless rules and regulations .
The Bible calls this “ the spirit of the world . ”
Such love is especially appreciated by those who may have been “ skinned and thrown about ” in the loveless world around us .
“ Love Never Fails ”
The Bible says that “ love never fails . ”
When she began to serve Jehovah God , her family disapproved and she had to move out of the house .
Thereafter , she wrote to her family often , filling her letters with the genuine warm affection that she felt for them .
Her mother and younger brother also accepted Bible truth .
Lastly , her father , who had been bitterly opposed , had a change of heart .
How heartwarming it is to know that soon all the wicked will be gone , leaving only those who practice genuine Christian love !
Truly , love is the key to happiness and life . ​ — Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 ; 1 John 3 : 14 .
( b ) How does the Bible assure us that a close relationship with God is within reach ?
Intimacy with Jehovah is possible only because our loving God has taken two important steps . ​ — Psalm 25 : 14 .
First , Jehovah arranged for Jesus “ to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many . ”
God’s worshipers have every reason to feel similarly about Jehovah .
So let us examine how the Bible reveals Jehovah’s cardinal attributes ​ — power , justice , wisdom , and love .
In this article , we will discuss the first three of these qualities .
Jeremiah 10 : 6 says : “ In no way is there anyone like you , O Jehovah . You are great , and your name is great in mightiness . ”
When you stand outside on a bright summer day , what do you feel on your skin ?
At its core , its temperature is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit [ 15 million degrees Celsius ] .
Note , for example , Isaiah 40 : 11 .
We read : “ Like a shepherd he will shepherd his own drove . With his arm he will collect together the lambs ; and in his bosom he will carry them . Those giving suck he will conduct with care . ”
What about today ?
Jehovah thus works to preserve our life , not just for a few short years , but for eternity .
Are we not drawn to a God who so lovingly uses his power in our behalf ?
Jehovah does what is right and fair , and he does so consistently , without partiality .
First , Jehovah’s justice moves him to show faithfulness and loyalty toward his servants .
From his own experience and from his study of God’s ways , what conclusion did David reach ?
His justice guarantees this ! ​ — Proverbs 2 : 7 , 8 .
Recognizing how difficult life could be for such families , Jehovah himself became their fatherly Judge and Protector .
A truly remarkable evidence of his impartiality is this : The opportunity of becoming his true worshipers , with endless life in view , is not restricted to an elite few .
Is that not true justice at its very best ?
“ O the Depth of God’s . . .
The apostle Paul was moved to exclaim , as recorded at Romans 11 : 33 : “ O the depth of God’s . . . wisdom and knowledge ! ”
16 , 17 .
Indeed , the more we learn about the things Jehovah has made , the more we find ourselves awed by his wisdom .
What exactly does that mean ?
Ps 51 Verses 2 and 3 say : “ Thoroughly wash me from my error , and cleanse me even from my sin .
Notice Ps 51 verse 5 : “ Look ! With error I was brought forth with birth pains , and in sin my mother conceived me . ”
( b ) What will be discussed in the next article ?
Yes , those writers were guided by holy spirit .
[ Picture on page 10 ]
Nothing else draws us so powerfully to Jehovah as his love .
4 , 5 . ( a ) What is the greatest act of love in all history ?
Some scientists estimate that the universe is 13 billion years old .
How was he occupied during all those ages ?
What thrilling , happy times they had !
With intense interest , He watched from heaven as Jesus grew up to be a perfect man .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What was Jesus put through on Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . , and how was his heavenly Father affected ?
( b ) Why did Jehovah allow his Son to suffer and die ?
As he was scourged , his back torn to ribbons ?
Since Jehovah has feelings , the pain he must have suffered over the death of his Son is beyond the power of our words to express .
It says : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
So God’s motive amounted to this : love .
Some may agree that God loves mankind in general , as John 3 : 16 says .
But they feel , in effect , ‘ God could never love me as an individual . ’
For example , consider Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 10 : 29 - 31 .
Why , the very hairs of our head are numbered !
Why can we be sure that Jesus was being realistic when he spoke of the hairs of our head being numbered ?
How intimately Jehovah must know us in order to re - create us !
How does the case of King Jehoshaphat show that Jehovah looks for the good in us even though we are imperfect ?
Take , for example , good King Jehoshaphat .
What a sobering thought !
It went on : “ Nevertheless , there are good things that have been found with you . ”
So Jehovah’s righteous anger did not blind him to the “ good things ” about Jehoshaphat .
When Jehovah forgives our sins , why may we feel assured that he views us as clean thereafter ?
Notice how Jehovah describes his capacity for forgiveness : “ Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow ; though they should be red like crimson cloth , they will become even like wool . ”
The word “ scarlet ” denotes a bright - red color .
Yet , Jehovah can take sins that are like scarlet and crimson and make them white like snow or undyed wool .
So when Jehovah forgives our sins , we need not feel that we bear the stain of such sins for the rest of our life .
Jehovah is here portrayed as taking the sins of a repentant wrongdoer and throwing them behind Him where He neither sees them nor takes notice of them anymore .
According to one reference work , the idea conveyed may be expressed : “ You have made [ my sins ] as if they had not happened . ”
In a promise of restoration , the prophet Micah expressed his conviction that Jehovah would forgive his repentant people : “ Who is a God like you , . . . passing over transgression of the remnant of his inheritance ? . . .
Compassion is another facet of Jehovah’s love .
Yes , they may forget , yet I will not forget you . ”
( The Amplified Bible ) It is hard to imagine that a mother would forget to nourish and care for her nursing child .
After all , an infant is helpless ; day and night a baby needs its mother’s attention .
Sad to say , however , maternal neglect is not unheard of , especially in these “ critical times . ”
Jehovah could not see the sufferings of his people or hear their outcries without feeling for them .
Thereafter , he provided them with miraculous food and delivered them into a fruitful land of their own .
Our loving God is deeply concerned about us as individuals .
But he has made abundant provisions for those who cry out to him for help .
All such provisions are expressions of “ the tender compassion of our God . ” ​ — Luke 1 : 78 .
• How do we know that love is Jehovah’s dominant quality ?
• In what vivid ways does the Bible describe Jehovah’s forgiveness ?
“ God . . . gave his only - begotten Son ”
“ You are worth more than many sparrows ”
© J .
IN BY far the majority of instances in the Christian Greek Scriptures , or New Testament , the word “ love ” is a translation of the Greek word a·gaʹpe .
“ Have intense love [ a·gaʹpe ] for one another , ” admonished the apostle Peter .
PICTURE in your mind a family that is expecting guests for dinner .
There is much work to be done .
Although some 30 years had passed since Jesus Christ had given the sign “ of the conclusion of the system of things , ” Christians were not to let down their guard .
Of course , we cannot literally ‘ speed up ’ the day of Jehovah .
Wait With “ Holy Acts of Conduct ”
To be holy , what must we do ?
To be holy , we must maintain physical , mental , moral , and spiritual cleanness .
Are we finding the gap between our moral standards and those of the world widening ?
The vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses , young and old , are sticking to God’s high moral standards and avoiding this world’s immoral enticements .
“ Deeds of godly devotion ” also are vital if we are to keep Jehovah’s day in mind .
Loyal attachment to Jehovah is the motivating force behind such deeds of godly devotion .
Even some of God’s people have reasoned in this way .
Spurred on by the urgency of the times and concern for his loved ones , however , he went home .
Instead , would it not be far more important to save lives ​ — our own and those of our family and others occupying the building ?
( b ) Why do Jehovah’s present - day servants stand out as different ?
As Jehovah’s present - day servants , we stand out as different from the world because we observe divine laws and principles .
A spot can generally be wiped off or cleansed away but not so a blemish .
A blemish indicates that something on the inside is wrong , at fault .
We Need to Be “ in Peace ”
For what qualities are Jehovah’s Witnesses well - known ?
To maintain our peace , we must have love among ourselves .
On the second day , however , he noticed the love and peace demonstrated in the enthusiastic welcome that the delegates received , though the local Witnesses did not know them personally .
On the final day , the vendor joined in the welcome and requested a Bible study .
Can we see ourselves dwelling with him peacefully in Paradise ?
Our ardent desire to see the end of wickedness is shown by our remaining holy in this immoral world .

“ A waiting attitude ” is reflected in holy acts of conduct

As we await Jehovah’s day , let us pursue peace with others
How Should We View People as Jehovah’s Day Approaches ?
JEHOVAH’S servants have a commission to “ make disciples of people of all the nations . ”
Let us consider two examples that show the importance of having God’s viewpoint .
Clearly , the debased condition of the city’s inhabitants proved that it deserved to be destroyed .
Son - in - law and your sons and your daughters and all who are yours in the city , bring out of the place ! ”
Now , let us go back to the time when Jehovah revealed his intention to inspect the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah .
Including its suburbs , Nineveh was a large city , “ with a walking distance of three days . ”
Even the king of Nineveh repented . ​ — Jonah 3 : 1 - 6 .
Jonah 3 : 10 says : “ The true God felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of causing to them ; and he did not cause it . ”
At that point , however , the prophet became sullen and did not share God’s view of the repentant inhabitants of Nineveh .
Jonah went out of Nineveh , built a booth , and sat in its shade “ until he would see what would become of the city . ”
Jehovah let a bottle - gourd plant grow so that it would provide shade for Jonah .
We draw that conclusion from the fact that Jehovah used him to record this inspired account .
He most likely would be concerned about those who have not yet heard the “ good news of the kingdom . ”
Why is it easy to develop a Jonahlike attitude toward people we meet in our ministry , and what can we do about this ?
Jehovah is concerned about those not yet serving him , and he listens to the petitions of his dedicated people .
We do not know the details about the extent of the preaching work yet to be accomplished before the arrival of Jehovah’s day , but we do know that the good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth to God’s satisfaction before the end comes .
Moreover , appreciative use of the Bible - based material provided through “ the faithful and discreet slave ” can add to our persuasiveness in frequently worked territory . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 - 47 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 14 - 17 .
Our concern for those who may yet respond to the life - giving Bible message moves us to consider various times and ways to approach householders in our ministry .
Fishermen go fishing when they can catch fish .
Can we do something similar in our spiritual fishing work ?
Some have found that parking lots , truck stops , gas stations , and stores are productive ‘ fishing grounds . ’
In what ways can we encourage missionaries and others serving in foreign lands ?
In addition to our preaching , can we show concern for such people even without leaving home ?
If so , we might well write them letters that show our appreciation for their work .
Our letters of encouragement and commendation could strengthen the missionaries to stay in their assignment , thus helping many more people to come to a knowledge of the truth .
We can also pray for missionaries and for those who are hungering for truth in other lands .
While remaining in their own homeland , however , other Witnesses of Jehovah have learned another language so as to be of spiritual help to immigrants .
One Christian who has been involved in the construction of Kingdom Halls in Japan learned that there was a need for skilled workers to build a place of worship in Paraguay .
What should be our principal concern and viewpoint as we await Jehovah’s great day ?
• As we await Jehovah’s day , how should we view people ?

The Poor Get Poorer
ECONOMIST Adam Smith made that statement back in the 18th century .
Not only are inequalities between rich and poor found in developing nations but , as the World Bank states , “ ‘ pockets of poverty ’ are common in all countries . ”
The New York Times quoted a 2001 U.S . Census Bureau report indicating that the gap between rich and poor in the United States has continued to grow .
The poorest fifth received 3.5 percent . ”
The situation is the same or worse in scores of other countries .
These included the eliminating of extreme poverty and hunger as well as gross inequality of income within countries .
He has included in its pages gems of wisdom ​ — practical principles that are applicable to all people , in all places , and at all times .
The Bible says : “ Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection ; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners . ”
What is the point ?
Money cannot buy life , but acting in wisdom can protect life now and can even open up the possibility of endless life .
You decide . ”
This helps a person to be content .
Are the poor doomed to stay in the clutches of poverty forever ?
God intends to take action to solve mankind’s problems , including poverty .
Having removed these “ kingdoms , ” or governments , God’s own appointed Ruler will act .
From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul , and their blood will be precious in his eyes . ”
Relief at last !
God’s appointed Ruler will act in behalf of the poor and the lowly .
So many problems associated with poverty will be solved at that time .
Rather , the real question is , What must you do to benefit when it happens ?
Two Witnesses talked to a lady through a closed door .
Finally , after a year and a half of patient effort , the pioneer succeeded in starting a Bible study with the householder .
“ You have redeemed me , O Jehovah the God of truth . ” ​ — PSALM 31 : 5 .
The situation on earth was the same .
To achieve his goal , he introduced untruth as a means to bring others under his control .
He further told her that by eating she would become like God , knowing good and bad .
That , too , was a lie .
Nonetheless , Satan’s slanderous assault against Jehovah continued , to the extent that centuries later the apostle John was inspired to write that Satan “ is misleading the entire inhabited earth . ”
How can you develop and strengthen your trust in Jehovah and fortify yourself against the deception and lies promoted by his Adversary ?
Since Jehovah is the Creator , he knows the truth about everything .
Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah , and who as his man of counsel can make him know anything ?
Truly , Jehovah is “ a God of knowledge ” and is “ perfect in knowledge . ”
How little we know in comparison !
You yourself have come to know my sitting down and my rising up .
My journeying and my lying outstretched you have measured off , and you have become familiar even with all my ways .
He wants what is best for us , and he is in a position to direct our ways .
Jehovah Is Truthful
How do we know that Jehovah is truthful ?
The Scriptures consistently testify to Jehovah’s truthfulness .
Jehovah’s very name testifies to his truthfulness .
( b ) What promises of Jehovah have you seen fulfilled ?
Joshua was one of many who witnessed remarkable events that testified to Jehovah’s truthfulness .
Toward the end of his life , Joshua told the older men of the nation of Israel : “ You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . They have all come true for you . Not one word of them has failed . ”
Though you have not witnessed the miracles Joshua did , have you experienced the truthfulness of God’s promises in your lifetime ?
Jehovah lovingly communicates with mankind , and he does it generously .
He has spoken through prophets , through angels , and even through his beloved Son , Jesus Christ .
To Pilate , Jesus said : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth .
It describes God’s attributes , purposes , and commands , as well as the true state of affairs among mankind .
We are wise to read it daily .
What are some lies that Satan promotes ?
On the contrary , the Scriptures assure us that “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
To the Jews who sang those words , mention of Jehovah’s holy mountain doubtless brought to mind Mount Zion , where King David brought the ark of the covenant to the tent he had erected there .
The mountain and the tent called to mind the place where Jehovah symbolically dwelt .
There people could approach God in order to implore his favor .
A friend of God is not devious or deceptive , for “ a man of . . . deception Jehovah detests . ”
How Would You Answer ?
• Why does Jehovah know the truth about everything ?
• What shows that Jehovah is truthful ?
The God of truth knows everything about what he has created
Jehovah’s promises will come true
“ WHAT is truth ? ”
Furthermore , “ wicked men and impostors . . . advance from bad to worse , misleading and being misled . ”
Though such people are always learning , they never come to “ an accurate knowledge of truth . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 .
Their wishful thinking will spell disaster for them when God’s time comes to destroy ungodly ones . ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 3 - 7 .
Jehovah’s Servants Know the Truth
In a description of “ the time of the end , ” the prophet Daniel foretold quite a different development among God’s people ​ — a revival of religious truth .
We have come to know Jehovah , the Supreme One .
Do you understand Bible truth ?
If so , you have been richly blessed .
The haughty , the proud , cannot grasp the precious truths of God’s Word .
Only God could produce such a book .
Paul counseled fellow believers : “ Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor , because we are members belonging to one another . ”
Therefore , he rightfully expects his servants to tell the truth .
Yet , a practice of lying is a vice .
When we are known to be truthful , others believe what we say ; they trust us .
Truthfulness means more than merely telling the truth .
It is a way of life .
“ Do you . . . the one teaching someone else , not teach yourself ? ”
If we are to impart truth to others , we must be truthful in all our ways .
Young ones among Jehovah’s servants also understand the importance of being truthful .
I make sure that my friends are those who tell the truth and are honest people . ”
Jehovah’s Servants Reveal the Truth
Of course , others besides Jehovah’s Witnesses may tell the truth and try to be honest .
Certainly ‘ much is demanded ’ of those who have been blessed with the precious knowledge of God .
What happiness do you find in imparting Bible truth to others ?
The faithfulness of John’s “ children ” ​ — perhaps those he introduced to the truth — ​ brought him great joy .
16 , 17 . ( a ) Why do not all accept the truth ?
Granted , not all will accept the truth .
Jesus spoke the truth about God , even when it was unpopular to do so .
We , like Jesus , do not hold back from telling the precious truth about Jehovah .
We publicly make known that we reject Satan’s counterfeit version of the truth and uphold the pure and unadulterated Word of God .
During his ministry on earth , he showed favor to those who were truthful .
What an honor !
How was a once blind man blessed for his courageous truthfulness ?
People marveled when Jesus restored his sight .
Disregarding any consequences , he boldly told the truth .
He explained how he was cured and that it was Jesus who did it .
After doing so , he built on the faith that the once blind man had shown .
To be untruthful is to be deceitful , unreliable , and false , and it incurs Jehovah’s disfavor .
Therefore , be resolved to pursue the course of truthfulness .
The blind man cured by Jesus was highly blessed for telling the truth
Though we were brought up in the Catholic faith , we were obsessed with the thought ‘ God , if you exist , why do you let such things happen ? ’ ”
Clearly , the mother who wrote that letter felt distressed and helpless .
I was ready to dismiss them politely , but then I noticed a brochure they were offering .
It was about why God permits suffering .
I figured that when it comes to suffering , my family really had had its fair share and that we had heard enough platitudes like ‘ God gave her to us , and God took her away . ’
That was two years ago .

Jehovah’s Servants Have True Hope
It is futile to hope in men for either dew or rain .
Why do we have true hope despite living in this troubled world ?
We have faith in Jehovah and in his Word because what he says always comes true .
Hence , Jehovah warned that he would take action against them .
What an Overview Reveals
Let us take a brief look at the contents of the book of Micah .
Mic Chapter 2 reveals that the wealthy and powerful are oppressing the weak and helpless .
Mic Chapter 5 reveals that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem of Judah .
6 , 7 .
What points are presented in chapters 6 and 7 of Micah’s prophecy ?
He wants his worshipers to exercise justice and to be kind and modest as they walk with him .
What fine information Jehovah reveals through Micah !
This inspired book provides warning examples of how God deals with those who claim to serve him but who are unfaithful .
And it gives divine counsel about how we should conduct ourselves during these difficult times so as to make our hope firm .
Jehovah was determined to take decisive action .
This time , the wicked “ vine of the earth ” will be cast into the great winepress of Jehovah’s anger , to the complete destruction of Satan’s system of things .
What is meant by the words of Micah 1 : 3 , 4 ?
In harmony with 2 Peter 3 : 10 - 12 , what makes our hope secure ?
Wicked Practices Abound
They would not commit such wicked deeds if they remembered Jehovah’s covenant .
19 , 20 .
What was the experience of Jews who trusted in Jehovah ?
As in Micah’s time , many now claim to serve God .
Although they now serve God in 234 lands , all these faithful worshipers of Jehovah have truly been set “ in unity . ”
By now , the sheep pen is “ noisy with men , ” as well as with women and children .
If so , you can have the conviction that victory is certain and your hope is sure .
Micah’s prophecy can strengthen us spiritually
It is God’s purpose to take action against wrongdoers .
2 , 3 . ( a ) Leaders of Israel should display what quality , but what are they actually doing ?
Yes , that is supposed to be their business , but what are they really doing ?
Says Micah : “ You haters of what is good and lovers of badness , tearing off their skin from people and their organism from off their bones ; you the ones who have also eaten the organism of my people , and have stripped their very skin from off them , and smashed to pieces their very bones , and crushed them to pieces like what is in a widemouthed pot and like flesh in the midst of a cooking pot . ” ​ — Micah 3 : 1 - 3 .
When a slaughtered sheep is prepared by boiling , it is first skinned and then disjointed .
Both the flesh and the bones are boiled in a large vessel , like the one mentioned by Micah .
What a fitting illustration of the abusive treatment the people in Micah’s day are experiencing at the hands of their evil leaders !
Because they do not exercise justice , they fail to fulfill their commission to protect the flock .
Moreover , this harmonizes with Isaiah 32 : 1 , where we read : “ Look ! A king will reign for righteousness itself ; and as respects princes , they will rule as princes for justice itself . ”
Empowered by God’s Spirit
The greedy leaders call out “ Peace ! ”
And the visionaries will have to be ashamed , and the diviners will certainly be disappointed . And they will have to cover over the mustache . ” ​ — Micah 3 : 5 - 7a .
Notice Micah 3 : 8 , where the faithful prophet says : “ On the other hand , I myself have become full of power , with the spirit of Jehovah , and of justice and mightiness . ”
Micah needs more than human strength in order to proclaim God’s message of adverse judgment .
In that case God could not answer our prayers for strength to do this work .
But these loyal ones pray to their Sovereign Lord , pleading : “ Jehovah , give attention to their threats , and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness . ”
It is evident that these powerful messages against Jerusalem and Samaria could be delivered only in Jehovah’s strength .
Looking back , we see that Micah next delivers a thrilling message of hope .
What heartening words we find at Micah 4 : 1 - 4 !
How is Micah 4 : 1 - 4 being fulfilled today ?
Rather , the prophecy applies to individuals out of all nations who turn to united sacred service in Jehovah’s mountain of true worship .
What is symbolized by ‘ sitting under one’s own vine and fig tree ’ ?
In our day , when fear covers the earth like an ominous cloud , we are thrilled that many are learning Jehovah’s ways .
If we are walking in Jehovah’s name , we are dedicated to him and are endeavoring to serve him faithfully out of whole - souled love .
21 , 22 .
How was Micah 5 : 2 fulfilled ?
Other dramatic developments are foretold in Micah chapter 5 .
Moreover , this Ruler will be great , not just in Israel , but to “ the ends of the earth . ”
They even quoted the words of Micah 5 : 2 .
True Refreshment for the People
Micah 5 : 5 - 15 refers to an Assyrian invasion that will meet with only fleeting success and points out that God will execute vengeance upon disobedient nations .
This lovely symbolism is used to foretell that the remnant of spiritual Jacob , or Israel , will be a blessing from God to the people .
( 2 ) Jehovah will not answer our prayers if we willfully practice sin .
How Would You Answer ?
Like Micah , we courageously carry out our ministry
What Does Jehovah Expect of Us ?
Have you ever felt like that ?
How God Treats His People
Shall I confront him with whole burnt offerings , with calves a year old ?
Shall I give my firstborn son for my revolt , the fruitage of my belly for the sin of my soul ? ”
Micah asks : “ What is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God ? ”
We must feel inclined to show these qualities , think about how to manifest them , and take action to display them .
In what ways ?
Consider Micah 6 : 10 .
They are also common in court .
How are Judah and Israel affected by the injustices practiced by the wicked ?
Mic 7 Verse 6 indicates that this has led to a state of affairs wherein relatives as close as sons and fathers , daughters and mothers , despise one another .
Yet , as God’s servants in the midst of this unrighteous world , we do not allow the spirit of this world’s unjust dealings to infiltrate the Christian congregation .
Do you not agree that by exercising justice we enjoy rich blessings resulting from a brotherhood that manifests real trust ?
How Do People Hear “ the Very Voice of Jehovah ” ?
How is this proving true ?
How do people of all nations hear “ the very voice of Jehovah , ” and how does this relate to our exercising of justice ?
Next , let us discuss the second requirement mentioned at Micah 6 : 8 .
Loving - kindness is an active regard for others , a compassionate concern for them .
Like Jehovah , we find pleasure , or delight , in showing loving - kindness to those in need .
Those who could not do such work donated food , supplies , and money .
Why did all these thousands of Witnesses come to the aid of their brothers ?
Because they “ love kindness . ”
This means to recognize our limitations and to depend on God .
We too must know our limitations but have confidence in our heavenly Father .
Instead of allowing this to discourage us , however , it is good to remember that God accepts our efforts and sacrifices ‘ according to what we have , not according to what we do not have . ’
Experiencing Jehovah’s blessing moves us to imitate Micah’s spirit .
Knowing that gives us a reason for showing a waiting attitude .
Have you had a similar experience ?
How is Micah 7 : 14 being fulfilled in our day ?
What lesson can we learn from considering Micah 7 : 18 , 19 ?
How have we benefited from this consideration of Micah’s prophecy ?
We have been encouraged to do everything possible to promote true worship so that we may walk in God’s name forever .
• What is involved in ‘ being modest in walking with God ’ ?
Soon the children were studying the Bible with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
But while doing military service , he read the book Life ​ — How Did It Get Here ?
By Evolution or by Creation ?
They considered Jehovah’s Witnesses to be annoying , although they admired the good manners and modest dress of the young Witnesses whom their children invited to their home .
Can you imagine how moving it was for Maria and Lucy to watch their parents being baptized by Hugo at one of the district conventions in Bolivia in 1999 ?
Along with Hugo , they are now in the full - time ministry .
Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Brother Henschel married Lucille Bennett in 1956 , and together they shared the joys and challenges of life .
Brother Henschel worked closely with Brother Knorr until Knorr’s death in 1977 .
Often at Brother Knorr’s side , Brother Henschel traveled to over 150 countries , visiting and encouraging Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world , especially missionaries and those in branch offices .
* Undaunted , Brother Henschel returned to Liberia just a few months later to meet with the president of the country and to seek greater freedom of worship for Jehovah’s Witnesses there .
Despite his heavy load of responsibility , he remained approachable , gentle , and kind .
M .
With his wife , Lucille
For weeks on end , every morning and every evening , the Philistine giant Goliath taunted the army of Israel , challenging them to send a champion out to fight him .
Still , the youth faced the giant and became an enduring symbol of courage . ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 1 - 51 .
Likely , many of us do .
Overcoming a Common Obstacle to Confidence in Jehovah
Many are taught that God is responsible for suffering .
It would be difficult to put confidence in such a hardhearted God .
Satan , who blinds the minds of unbelievers , is eager to promote all such “ teachings of demons . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 4 : 1 ; 2 Corinthians 4 : 4 .
How does 1 Peter 5 : 8 point out one reason for human suffering ?
According to Ecclesiastes 9 : 11 , why do people suffer ?
Understanding some of the causes of suffering is important .
A passage in the apostle Paul’s letter to the Romans sheds light on this important subject .
Paul wrote : “ The eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God .
“ All creation , ” then , can refer only to mankind .
What , exactly , did that rebellion do to mankind ?
Now we come to the key question : Why did “ the Judge of all the earth ” subject mankind to this painful , frustrating existence ?
In rebelling against God , they took sides with Satan , who raised a sweeping challenge to Jehovah’s sovereignty .
In sentencing the rebels , Jehovah , in effect , gave them what they asked for .
But Jehovah in his mercy allowed Adam and Eve to live out their lives and bear offspring .
( a ) Why may we be certain that Jehovah is not responsible for the suffering we see in the world today ?
He has lovingly made arrangements for faithful descendants of Adam and Eve to see the end of futility and to delight in “ the glorious freedom of the children of God . ”
As we review these reasons for human suffering , do we see any basis for blaming wickedness on Jehovah or for losing our confidence in him ?
On the contrary , such a study gives us reason to echo these words of Moses : “ The Rock , perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice . A God of faithfulness , with whom there is no injustice ; righteous and upright is he . ”
What is involved in trusting in Jehovah ?
Some think of such trust merely as a feeling , a kind of blissful emotion that should well up naturally in the heart .
Others seem to believe that trusting in God means that we can expect him to shield us from every difficulty , to solve our every problem , to make every daily challenge turn out just as we hope ​ — and right away !
But such notions are unfounded .
What is involved in trusting in Jehovah ?
To illustrate : Think of a small child sitting in the backseat of a car , with his parents in front .
His father is at the wheel .
When difficulties arise during the journey ​ — a question about the proper route or perhaps a problem with the weather or the condition of the road — ​ how does an obedient , trusting child react ?
So the day - to - day decisions we make in life should reflect our trust in Jehovah .
Our next article will take up that subject .
How Would You Answer ?
• How did David show that he had made Jehovah his confidence ?
• What are three causes of human suffering today , and why is it good to review them from time to time ?
Jesus showed that when a certain tower fell in Jerusalem , Jehovah was not responsible
IT IS one thing to claim that we trust in God .
Ironically , many people ​ — not just in that land but throughout the world — ​ put greater trust in money and material wealth than they do in God . ​ — Luke 12 : 16 - 21 .
Let us now consider how we can take those three steps in times of distress .
Or we may have little choice but to work long hours for meager wages .
Is the Most High God willing to help us at such times ?
But what can we pray for ?
5 , 6 . ( a ) Why may we look to God’s Word for help to cope with economic pressures ?
Consider some examples of the Bible’s wisdom .
( See also footnote . ) ( b ) What wise advice did Jesus offer about how to avoid undue anxiety ?
When encountering financial distress , we can also show our trust in Jehovah by looking to the publications of “ the faithful and discreet slave ” for help .
magazine has featured articles containing helpful tips and suggestions for dealing with economic challenges .

* Of course , such guidelines must be balanced with a proper view of the true importance of money .
More than that , he is willing to help .
He himself may have been seriously ill when he wrote of God’s dealings with an upright sick one .
How , though , can we display trust in God when we are distressed by health problems ?
We may also ask him to help us exercise patience and endurance so as to put up with the illness .
( See the box on page 17 . ) ( b ) What advice about dealing with chronic health ailments was presented in Awake !
of January 22 , 2001 ?
magazines have occasionally published informative articles on a wide variety of specific health problems and diseases .
In addition , certain articles have offered Scriptural suggestions as well as practical advice on how to live with chronic health problems .
The article “ Living Successfully With Your Ailment ​ — How ? ”
Above all , maintain a close bond with Jehovah and with the congregation .
When a Fleshly Weakness Persists
How was the apostle Paul able to prevail in his battle against the weaknesses of the imperfect flesh , and what assurance can we have ?
Paul knew firsthand how difficult it can be to struggle against the desires and weaknesses of the imperfect flesh .
Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death ?
We need to ask , even beg , Jehovah for the help of his holy spirit .
We can specifically ask for self - control , which is part of the fruitage of God’s spirit .
Let us never weary of praying humbly to our merciful God , asking his forgiveness and help .
If we supplicate him with a sincere , contrite heart , Jehovah will help us fight temptations . ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
to resist a tendency toward unwholesome entertainment ?
We can also show that we trust in Jehovah by searching his Word for help .
Then we might memorize such texts as Proverbs 14 : 17 and Ephesians 4 : 31 .
Do we have a tendency toward unwholesome entertainment ?
We might try to remember such verses as Ephesians 5 : 3 and Colossians 3 : 5 .
In a letter to the U.S . Mint , dated November 20 , 1861 , Treasury Secretary Salmon P .
But such renderings imply that we should not start being anxious or worried .
One reference work says : “ The Greek verb tense is a present imperative , implying a command to stop doing some action already in progress . ”
When we are distressed by challenges to our health , it is encouraging to read about others who have successfully coped with health disorders , ailments , or disabilities .

Yes , there is a message of hope !
In addition to giving a message of hope , the Bible helps us to cope with daily challenges , such as how to overcome the lack of self - respect , which may be caused by being poor .
We also desire to use our tongue to praise Jehovah , both in our public ministry and in our private conversations .
The psalmist sang : “ In God we will offer praise all day long , and to time indefinite your name we shall laud . ” ​ — Psalm 44 : 8 .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What problem do all of us face with regard to our speech ?
Despite our best intentions , therefore , our speech does not always build others up or furnish praise to our Creator .
This article will consider how we can do that , what sort of topics we can talk about , and what benefits we can derive from upbuilding speech .
Pay Attention to the Heart
How does the heart play a key role in promoting upbuilding conversations ?
In cultivating the habit of engaging in upbuilding conversations , we must first recognize that our speech reflects what is in our heart .
Adjusting our priorities will improve our conversations as well as our lives . ​ — Philippians 1 : 10 .
What part does meditation play in our conversations ?
Purposeful meditation is another way to improve the quality of what we say .
And how spiritually stimulating can be the experiences from our Christian ministry !
“ Continue Considering These Things ”
He wrote : “ Whatever things are true , whatever things are of serious concern , whatever things are righteous , whatever things are chaste , whatever things are lovable , whatever things are well spoken of , whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is , continue considering these things . ”
We should fill our minds and hearts with them .
So let us see how giving attention to each of the eight things cited by Paul can help us with our conversations .
How can our conversations involve things that are true ?
What things of serious concern can be included in our conversations ?
The word righteous means being right in God’s eyes ​ — meeting his standards .
When Paul recommends considering lovable things , he refers to matters that are pleasing and agreeable or that inspire love , as opposed to those that arouse hatred , bitterness , or contention .
Things well spoken of refer to information that is reputable or of good report .
Such good reports would include the life stories of faithful brothers and sisters , which appear regularly in the Watchtower and Awake !
And how encouraging it is to hear of the spiritual accomplishments of others !
Paul speaks of “ whatever virtue there is . ”
We must be careful that our lips are guided by Scriptural principles and that they do not deviate from what is righteous , chaste , and virtuous .
The apostle Paul frequently praised the fine qualities of his fellow worshipers .
16 , 17 .
“ The Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak , ” Jesus told his disciples .
And what about now ?
I really value these conversations . ”
Why do all of us need spiritual conversations ?
Do we not also treasure opportunities to enjoy rewarding spiritual conversations with our fellow believers ?
These opportunities present themselves at meetings , in the field ministry , and at social gatherings and while traveling .
Paul looked forward to talking with the Christians in Rome .
“ I am longing to see you , ” he wrote them , “ that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you , by each one through the other’s faith , both yours and mine . ”
“ Spiritual conversations with fellow Christians fill a vital need , ” observes Johannes , a Christian elder .
Show understanding to those who are shy .
* Above all , never let the attitudes of others hold you back from talking about the things that touch your heart .
[ Footnote ]
“ whatever things are of serious concern ”
In the prophecy of Ezekiel , Jehovah referred to Daniel as a righteous man .
As shown by the experience of one missionary , how can prayer help us to maintain integrity ?
What reasons do we have for approaching Jehovah constantly ?
And what should we do if we feel unworthy to pray to God because of our shortcomings ?
What unique friendship does prayer help us to enjoy ?
What does the example of Jesus teach us about the need to “ pray continually ” ?
How easily , though , we can neglect prayer !
Just dealing with pressures of everyday life can absorb so much of our attention that we do not make an effort to speak to God .
Jesus encouraged his disciples to “ pray continually , ” and he himself did that .
Appropriate moments for private prayer present themselves many times each day as we face problems , encounter temptations , and make decisions .
When we seek God’s guidance in all aspects of life , our friendship with him is certain to grow .
If two friends face problems together , does not the bond of friendship between them become stronger ?
Nehemiah quickly uttered a silent prayer before making a petition to the king of Persia .
We too have reason to praise the Creator regularly .
What part does prayer play in strengthening our faith ?
Then God reassured Abraham : “ So your seed will become . ”
He spent a whole night in private prayer before appointing his 12 apostles .
When we open up our heart to Jehovah in prayer , do we not sense that he is interested in our needs and tenderly cares for us ?
Jesus ’ model prayer includes the request that Jehovah “ deliver us from the wicked one , ” Satan the Devil . ​ — Matthew 6 : 13 .
“ For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me , ” he said . ​ — Philippians 4 : 13 ; 2 Corinthians 11 : 23 - 29 .
What might happen , though , when our conduct falls short of God’s standards ?
Jonah ran away from his assignment .
Jonah prayed , Jehovah answered his prayer , and Jonah recovered spiritually .
José Ángel also prayed fervently for help .
I now pray regularly every day , and I look forward to these times . ”
What father would reject a son who humbly turns to him for help and advice after making a mistake ?
Jehovah urges all erring ones to call to him , “ for he will forgive in a large way . ”
Then we must make certain that our request is in harmony with Jehovah’s will and is offered in Jesus ’ name .
On the other hand , we should not be quick to conclude that seemingly unanswered prayers are always evidence of God’s disapproval .
Pray Regularly
( b ) What will we receive when we daily approach Jehovah’s throne of undeserved kindness ?
Let us never be too busy to talk to him .
How Would You Answer ?

Thousands of buildings collapsed , and tens of thousands of people were killed .
Today , many wonder how a good and loving God can seemingly remain passive in the face of so much suffering and injustice .
According to a 1997 survey conducted in France , a predominantly Catholic country , some 40 percent of the people doubt the existence of God because of genocides , such as the one that took place in Rwanda in 1994 .
Why does God not intervene to prevent bad things from happening ?
He wrote : “ Whereas the existence of the world opens the eyes , as it were , of the human soul to the existence of God , to his wisdom , power and greatness , evil and suffering seem to obscure this image , sometimes in a radical way , especially in the daily drama of so many cases of undeserved suffering and of so many faults without proper punishment . ”
Is the existence of an all - loving and all - powerful God , as presented in the Bible , compatible with the prevalence of human suffering ?

Divine Intervention ​ — What Can We Expect ?
Here I am adding onto your days fifteen years . ” ​ — Isaiah 38 : 1 - 5 .
To fulfill his promises , Jehovah was motivated to intervene in behalf of his people on numerous occasions throughout the pre - Christian era .
God did not intervene to prevent a wave of persecution perpetrated against Christ’s disciples by the Roman Emperor Nero .
Christians were tortured , burned alive , and thrown to wild animals .
However , this opposition did not surprise the early Christians , and it certainly did not weaken their faith in God’s existence .
Several faithful servants of Jehovah were injured by an explosion in Toulouse , and thousands of faithful Christians died in Nazi and Communist camps or under other tragic circumstances without God’s stepping in to prevent it .
The removal of sickness and death and the ‘ wiping out of every tear ’ from human eyes are yet in the future . ​ — Revelation 21 : 1 - 4 .
This does not mean , however , that God in the meantime simply observes indifferently while creation agonizes .
In addition , God takes direct action in the life of those who are willing to be guided by him .
Yes , by providing the opportunity of getting to know him , his Word , and his purposes , God gives proof of his loving interest in each and every one of us . ​ — John 17 : 3 .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ For all things I have the strength by virtue of him [ Jehovah God ] who imparts power to me . ” ​ — Philippians 4 : 13 .
Kingdom Proclaimers Report
He’s a good student . ”
“ That’s incredible , ” said Janina .
Sensing an opportunity to give a witness , Dorota explained : “ Many parents today fail to give their children proper training .
asked Janina .
“ For example , according to Deuteronomy 6 : 6 - 9 , educating our children begins with educating ourselves .
“ This is incredible ! ”
“ We use a book entitled Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work . ”
* She then went on to describe the book and mentioned some of the topics it covers .
“ This is a revelation ! ”
Not her given name .
When Jesus said those words , he was before Pontius Pilate , the Roman Governor of Judea .
However , the word martyr comes from a Greek term ( marʹtys ) that in Bible times meant “ witness , ” a person who gives testimony , perhaps at a court hearing , to the truth of what he believes .
As he told Pilate , he came to “ bear witness to the truth . ”
Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens . ” ​ — Matthew 5 : 10 - 12 .
Jesus also said : “ Brother will deliver up brother to death , and a father his child , and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death .
He was “ full of graciousness and power [ and ] was performing great portents and signs among the people . ”
On the contrary , the account tells us that “ those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word . ”
What persecution continued to come upon Jesus ’ followers ?
Indeed , there was no letup as far as hardship was concerned .
Revelation also contains a reference to “ Antipas , my witness , the faithful one , who was killed ” in Pergamum . ​ — Revelation 1 : 9 ; 2 : 13 .
All of this proved true Jesus ’ words to his disciples : “ If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . ”
Why is persecution of Christians not just a matter of history ?
Paul , who as we have seen endured his share of hardship , wrote : “ All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted . ”
Down to these “ last days ” of this system of things , Jehovah’s people continue to be objects of hatred and hostility .
The apostle Peter commented on this matter in his first letter , which he wrote about 62 - 64 C.E . , when Christians throughout the Roman Empire were undergoing trials and persecution .
As it was , they suffered because they endeavored to live up to their role as followers of Christ .
What contradiction is seen in the treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses today ?
Why such evident contradiction ?
What is the foremost reason that God permits his people to suffer persecution ?
Yes , it is because of the age - old issue of universal sovereignty .
It will turn out to you for a witness . ”
Jesus himself bore witness before Herod and Pontius Pilate .
The apostle Paul too was “ haled before kings and governors . ”
Finally , coping with trials and tribulations can benefit us personally .
Thus , we do not dread it , nor do we seek unscriptural means to evade or end it .
Rather , we heed James ’ admonition : “ Let endurance have its work complete , that you may be complete and sound in all respects , not lacking in anything . ” ​ — James 1 : 2 - 4 .
What can we do when we are faced with persecution ?
We will consider these important matters in the next article .
[ Footnotes ]
See The Watchtower of December 15 , 1995 , pages 27 - 9 ; April 15 , 1994 , pages 16 - 17 ; and Awake !
• Primarily in what sense was Jesus a martyr ?
• For what reasons does Jehovah allow persecution to come upon his servants ?
[ Pictures on page 10 , 11 ]
PAUL
However , Jesus and other faithful ones gave their life and died as martyrs for their faith .
What Biblical examples of dealing with persecution can you relate ?
Their objective was to advance the preaching work and to maintain their integrity to Jehovah .
Their reactions in various situations provide examples for those Christians who today are faced with trials and persecution .
In so doing , the brothers followed the precedent set by Jesus and Paul .
Even though the Malawian brothers had to move away or go into hiding , they sought and followed theocratic direction and carried on their Christian activities underground as best they could .
A peak of 18,519 Kingdom publishers had been reached just before the ban in 1967 .
Without a doubt , their actions brought praise to Jehovah , and Jehovah’s blessing was upon those faithful brothers through that most difficult time .
By making such a choice , some have even been able to contribute to legal victories in their land .
*
Some of his servants are facing trials and persecution today ; others may do so later .
All will be tested in one way or another , and no one should expect to be exempt .
As dedicated servants of Jehovah , we cannot sidestep the universal issue involving the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the vindication of his sovereignty . ​ — Ezekiel 38 : 23 ; Matthew 6 : 9 , 10 .
Another important principle that we can learn from the way Jesus and the apostles reacted under pressure is never to retaliate against our persecutors .
What does one historian say about the early Christians ’ attitude toward the State ?
In his book The Early Church and the World , historian Cecil J .
He writes : “ We have no direct evidence that an effort was ever made on the part of the Christians of this period to withstand persecution by force .
Why is it better to endure suffering than to retaliate ?
Would it not be prudent to defend oneself ?
In this regard , we can look to Jesus as our model .
The Joy of Sanctifying Jehovah’s Name
What was the joy that sustained Jesus through all his trials ?
Like those 230 faithful ones , we too may have our faith tested , even though we have not yet “ resisted as far as blood . ”
In addition , the resolve to abstain from blood , to marry only in the Lord , or to bring up children in the faith in a divided household can sometimes result in severe pressures and trials . ​ — Acts 15 : 29 ; 1 Corinthians 7 : 39 ; Ephesians 6 : 4 ; 1 Peter 3 : 1 , 2 .
In the power of Jehovah’s spirit , we have the strength to bear up under even the most difficult trials , all to his glory and praise . ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 7 ; Ephesians 3 : 16 ; Philippians 4 : 13 .
The events of the 1960 ’ s were but the first of a series of bitter and murderous persecution that the Witnesses in Malawi had to endure over nearly three decades .
For the full text of this resolution , see the 1974 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses , pages 208 - 9 .
A first - person account by a survivor of the march can be found in the January 1 , 1998 , issue of The Watchtower , pages 25 - 9 .
• How do Christians view suffering and persecution ?
He even stopped his followers from putting up any resistance and let the mob take him away . ​ — John 18 : 3 - 12 .
• In Jerusalem , Peter and others were arrested , flogged , and ordered to stop speaking about Jesus .
• When Saul , who later became the apostle Paul , learned of the plot by the Jews in Damascus to do away with him , the brothers put him in a basket and lowered him through an opening in the city wall by night , and he escaped . ​ — Acts 9 : 22 - 25 .
The joy of sanctifying Jehovah’s name sustained these faithful ones through the Nazi death march and concentration camps
IN BIBLE times , an oxgoad ​ — a long rod , usually tipped with a sharp metal spike — ​ was used for driving and guiding draft animals .
Could we also unintentionally be “ kicking against the goads ” ?
The inspired counsel in God’s Word can motivate and guide us correctly ​ — if we let it .
Our heeding divine counsel will likewise bring us eternal blessings . ​ — Proverbs 3 : 1 - 6 .
Yet , who will claim that saying no is always easy ?
( b ) What should these examples encourage us to do ?
Since all imperfect humans have difficulty exercising self - control , we should be interested in learning how to win any personal battle that we face .
It led to the death of their child conceived in adultery and of Bath - sheba’s husband , both of whom were innocent .
Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death ? ”
The lack of ability and willingness to say no is more evident now than ever before .
We should keep in mind that all “ the works of the flesh ” could be avoided if we had perfect self - control .
Some Christians have a more difficult time exercising self - control than do others .
To illustrate : We may know that some fellow Christians who have given up tobacco or the use of “ recreational ” drugs may at times still have a strong craving for them .
Others have trouble guarding their tongue , so they often stumble in word .
Why ?
James 3 : 2 realistically admits : “ We all stumble many times .
Still others feel a strong urge to gamble .
Or they may find it difficult to control their temper .
As the struggle continues , let us assist one another not to give up . ​ — Acts 14 : 21 , 22 .
At the same time , they are determined to marry “ only in the Lord , ” as the Scriptures counsel .
How can we be of help to a brother or a sister who is interested in getting married but who has not been able to do so ?
Imagine the potential frustration of a person who desires to marry but who has not been able to do so !
That might be said with no ill intent , but how much better for us to manifest self - control in the sense of guarding our tongue !
Why is a measure of self - control needed even by those who are married ?
Being married does not in itself eliminate the need for self - control as it relates to sex .
What can we do in behalf of ones struggling to exercise self - control ?
How grateful married couples can be if both have learned to exercise proper self - control in this most intimate relationship .
We should never forget to pray that Jehovah give our spiritual brothers insight , courage , and determination to continue their fight to manifest self - control and to take steps to overcome improper desires . ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
At times , we may find it difficult to be understanding toward fellow Christians who are struggling to show self - control in an area that gives us no trouble .
But people differ by nature .
Some are easily ruled by emotions ; others are not .
We can see that from Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 5 : 7 .
We can treasure the parent , mate , or friend who prevents us from going places we should not go , from seeing things we should not see , or from doing things we should not do .
One of Jehovah’s Witnesses living in Germany was employed as a technical communications clerk .
The sex scenes caused tension between me and my wife .
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
How does 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 12 indicate that two kinds of changes must be made to gain God’s approval ?
Certain features of the old personality that prospective Witnesses of Jehovah must put away are directly condemned by God’s Word .
We will if in faith we exercise self - control while running our Christian race without letup and through to completion .
Self - Control to Do Good
The natural tendency of imperfect humans is to do wrong , so we have a twofold struggle .
( b ) Meditating on what will help us to exercise greater self - control ?
Clearly , self - control is vital if we are to follow through on our dedication to God .
We can meditate on the benefits of avoiding things that are morally wrong or physically debilitating .
Being realistic , however , we must not forget that our heart is treacherous .
Illustrate .
Jehovah takes delight in the willingness of humans to participate in this life - giving work .
“ In All Things ” ?
What is included in exercising “ self - control in all things ” ?
Parents do well to teach their children not to buy whatever they see just because it is available , is appealing , or is financially within their reach .
Of course , if such instruction is to be effective , parents must set the proper example . ​ — Luke 10 : 38 - 42 .
A magazine from a prosperous European land recently noted : “ If keeping undesirable impulses under control requires an inner struggle on the part of those living under the agonizing circumstances of extreme poverty , how much more so is that true of those living in the land of milk and honey in today’s affluent society ! ”
He reasoned : “ We have brought nothing into the world , and neither can we carry anything out . So , having sustenance and covering , we shall be content with these things . ”
It is , though , a lesson worth learning .
Attending Christian meetings , assemblies , and conventions also involves a particular manifestation of self - control .
How wise it is to discipline ourselves concerning inappropriate jobs , friendships , attitudes , and personal habits or to discipline ourselves to say no to activities that could rob us of precious time for God’s service !
Become Full - Grown Through Self - Control
A study of four - year - old children revealed that those who had learned to exercise a degree of self - control “ generally grew up to be better adjusted , more popular , adventurous , confident and dependable teenagers . ”
“ In order that we should no longer be babes , tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men , by means of cunning in contriving error . ”
Therefore , let us joyfully use these provisions .
This should motivate us to continue to strive for more self - control .
Each time we score a victory , we have reason to be pleased with ourselves .
Above all , we should remember that self - control involves the mind and emotions .
Should wrong thoughts arise , reject them immediately .
As we do our best , we will be following the counsel of Psalm 55 : 22 : “ Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself , and he himself will sustain you . Never will he allow the righteous one to totter . ”
• In what two ways must we exercise self - control ?
• Replace what God forbids with things that he encourages
• Avoid compromising situations
Is Anyone to Be Trusted ?
Lydia and Robert each suffered an alarming breach of trust , with grave consequences .
What is trust ?
According to a survey published in Germany in 2002 , “ fewer than 1 in 3 youths have a basic trust in other people . ”
[ Blurb on page 3 ]
Trust Is Vital for a Happy Life
But to give up food entirely so as to avoid the risk of food poisoning is not a realistic option .
Without food no one can survive long .
Why not ?
Since we have a basic need to put our trust in someone , whom can we trust without running the risk of being let down ?
Trust in Jehovah With All Your Heart
God’s love influences everything he does .
Consider some examples .
Doris has lived in the Dominican Republic , Germany , Greece , and the United States .
By reading the Bible carefully , we can take note of his counsel on this matter .
Even those who are held in high esteem as the “ nobles ” of this world , such as experts in specialized fields of knowledge or activity , do not automatically deserve our trust .
An example from the ancient nation of Israel may help us .
What can we learn from this ?
These were men who showed certain godly qualities before being appointed to positions of trust .
It was clear to everyone that these men did their very best to uphold God’s standards .
Do Not Be Put Off by Occasional Disappointment
This is in accord with the principle : “ The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much . ”
Students of the Bible will recall that on the night of his arrest , Jesus Christ was badly let down by his apostles .
Peter even denied Jesus three times .
Similarly , if we feel betrayed by someone we trust , we do well to consider whether the perceived betrayal is evidence of an untrustworthy spirit or of a momentary weakness of the flesh .
A reliable person is faithful to his marriage mate .
Bearing in mind such reasonable and Scriptural standards will help us to recognize people we can trust .

Women Who Made Jehovah’s Heart Rejoice
“ May Jehovah reward the way you act , and may there come to be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah . ” ​ — RUTH 2 : 12 .
1 , 2 .
But that challenge can be met , as is demonstrated by millions of God - fearing women who form a large part of God’s people today .
3 , 4 . ( a ) Why did Shiphrah and Puah refuse to obey Pharaoh when he ordered that every newborn Israelite male be killed ?
At the Nuremberg trials , held in Germany after World War II , many who were convicted of mass murder tried to excuse the crimes they committed by arguing that they were simply obeying orders .
Because they “ feared the true God . ” ​ — Exodus 1 : 15 , 17 ; Genesis 9 : 6 .
He rewarded Shiphrah and Puah with families of their own .
Yes , indeed !
A Former Prostitute Brings Joy to Jehovah’s Heart
She was also familiar with Israel’s more recent victories over the Amorite Kings Sihon and Og .
How did Jehovah bless Rahab for her faith and obedience ?
What an honor !
When David’s provisions are running low , he sends ten young men to Nabal to request food .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Abigail prove to be sensible as well as loyal to Jehovah and his anointed one ?
When she finds him , however , he is “ as drunk as could be . ”
So she waits until he is sober and then tells him .
How does Nabal react ?
He is so stunned that he is overcome by what may be some form of paralysis .
When David learns of Nabal’s death , he proposes marriage to Abigail , whom he evidently admires and deeply respects .
Yes , draw closer to Jehovah through regular Bible study , prayer , meditation , and association with fellow Christians .
The widow of Zarephath , apparently recognizing that Elijah was Jehovah’s prophet , “ did according to Elijah’s word . ”
For example , every week , unselfish Christian sisters ​ — many of whom are poor and have families to care for — ​ extend hospitality to traveling overseers and their wives .
Others share meals with local full - time ministers , help the needy , or in some other way give of themselves and of their resources to support the Kingdom work .

Jesus ’ genealogy , as recorded by Matthew , mentions four women by name ​ — Tamar , Rahab , Ruth , and Mary .
All are held in high esteem in God’s Word . ​ — Matthew 1 : 3 , 5 , 16 .
Why is Rahab a fine example of someone having faith ?
Faithful Christian Women ​ — Precious Worshipers of God
That Jehovah would use women in a mighty way in the outworking of his purpose was foretold in the Scriptures .
By their zeal in the ministry , this large , spiritual army of faithful sisters contributed to the rapid spread of Christianity in the first century .
In fact , about 60 C.E . , the apostle Paul wrote that the good news had been “ preached in all creation that is under heaven . ” ​ — Colossians 1 : 23 .
5 , 6 .
What contributed to Priscilla’s zeal and courage ?
Evidently , then , Priscilla was a good student of God’s Word and of the teaching of the apostles .
“ Gwen’s zeal as an evangelizer was almost legendary in our city , ” says her husband .
Gwen and her husband were married for 61 years .
Many have put aside owning a home or having children in order to serve Jehovah more fully .
She has always held the view that Jehovah deserves the very best that we can give to him ​ — a principle that she applies to herself both as a servant of God and as a mother . ”
How precious such women are to their husbands , to fellow Christians , and above all , to Jehovah ! ​ — Proverbs 31 : 28 , 30 .
Precious Women Without a Husband
If you are among those who faithfully serve Jehovah without the support of a Christian mate , you can be sure that you are precious in God’s eyes .
( a ) What do we learn from the example set by those who visited Jephthah’s daughter ?
One way is seen in an ancient example .
What was done to encourage her ?
“ From year to year the daughters of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite , four days in the year . ”
Likewise , we should give heartfelt commendation to single sisters who loyally obey God’s law .
( b ) How may single parents act in harmony with their prayers ?
However , they can turn to Jehovah for help in rearing their children in harmony with Bible principles .
True , if you are a single parent , you cannot be both mother and father in all respects .
Would you struggle up the stairs if an elevator was nearby ?
Likewise , 1 Peter 5 : 7 invites you to throw all your anxieties upon Jehovah “ because he cares for you . ”
So when problems and anxieties weigh you down , unburden yourself on your heavenly Father , doing so “ incessantly . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 17 ; Psalm 18 : 6 ; 55 : 22 .
* To this day , that is my favorite Kingdom melody . ”
“ As a result , four of my five sisters and I entered the full - time ministry .
Yet , Mom never boasted about these things to others .
True , not all children grow up to serve God as did Olivia’s .
Much of God’s support is provided by means of the Christian congregation , with its regular spiritual feeding program , its Christian brotherhood , and its spiritually mature “ gifts in men . ”
Jehovah created the woman as a complement of the man .
A modest , God - fearing woman does not ambitiously promote herself or compete with her husband .
Consider the Bible example of Queen Esther .
But she was no weakling !

In harmony with Jehovah’s direction , the prophet Elijah had anointed Elisha as his successor .
Hence , Elisha asked for two parts of Elijah’s spiritual inheritance .
Elisha realized that in order to fulfill the responsibilities related to this daunting assignment , he needed spiritual power far beyond his own capabilities , power that only Jehovah could provide .
Elisha’s request was granted .
Jehovah provided him with the spirit he needed to take on his new task and to face coming trials .
“ I Found Friendship , Love , and Attention ”
Can that kind of love still be found in the world ?
The letter writer , a woman named Marília , wrote :
Yes , there are still people who act with true Christian love .
‘ Handle God’s Word Aright ’
WORKERS need tools to help them get their jobs done .
You would have to know how to drive a nail into wood without bending the nail .
Jesus Christ urged his followers to ‘ seek first the kingdom . ’
What kind of worker was Paul ?
He used “ persuasion . ”
How ?
6 , 7 .
How ?
Consider three important ways : ( 1 ) Direct attention to God’s Word in a way that creates respect for it .
( 2 ) Tactfully explain and apply what the Bible says .
Our Ministry Must Be Rooted in God’s Word
Regarding the use of God’s Word , what can we learn from Paul’s counsel to Timothy ?
How can we use God’s Word as an effective tool ?
What is entailed in “ handling the word of the truth aright ” ?
The same is true today .
“ We are God’s fellow workers , ” so we must not be hypocritical workmen .
You , the one saying ‘ Do not commit adultery , ’ do you commit adultery ?
What results can we expect from handling God’s Word aright ?
Consider the power that the written Word of God can have on the lives of honesthearted individuals .
What can application of God’s Word produce in a person ?
When accepted as authoritative , the message of God’s Word exerts a dynamic influence that helps people to make remarkable changes in their lives .
The Thessalonians “ accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit ” and became examples to other believers . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 1 : 5 - 7 .
He does not disown it as if it were a foreign thing to him . . . .
Fittingly , Paul wrote : “ The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit , and of joints and their marrow , and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart . ” ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Explain the transforming power of God’s Word .

This woman continued her Bible discussions with the Witnesses and did not allow threats of removal as pastor to stop her .
The friend became so enthusiastic about what she was learning that at one of her church services , she was moved to say , “ Come , study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ”
A full - time Kingdom proclaimer held a Bible study with her in the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life .
Do You Recall ?
AT CAESAREA in 58 C.E . , Roman Governor Porcius Festus was visited by King Herod Agrippa II and his sister Bernice .
But I perceived he had committed nothing deserving of death .
For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to signify the charges against him . ” ​ — Acts 25 : 24 - 27 .
However , Paul was innocent .
What Paul says begins to affect the king .
Why were Paul’s words to Agrippa so effective ?
In the book of Acts , Greek terms for persuasion are repeatedly used in association with Paul .
In the original language of the Christian Greek Scriptures , “ persuade ” means to “ win over ” or bring about “ a change of mind by the influence of reason or moral considerations , ” states Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words .
By means of logical reasoning , sound argument , and earnest entreaty , Paul endeavored to bring about a change of mind in individuals to whom he spoke .
How may this be done ?
You may use examples from your listener’s experience .
The apostle recognized Agrippa as an expert on the complex customs and laws of his Jewish subjects and said that he was happy that he could make his defense before such a well - informed ruler .
How can you , like Paul , motivate your listeners ?
Appealing to Agrippa’s knowledge of Judaism , Paul reasoned that his preaching really involved “ saying nothing except things the Prophets as well as Moses stated were going to take place ” regarding the Messiah’s death and resurrection .
Agrippa faced a dilemma .
A congregation of believers was established .
For example , a traveling overseer of Jehovah’s Witnesses wrote : “ Quite a number of brothers and sisters are now carrying a Bible in their hand when they witness from door to door .
It has helped both the householder and the publisher to associate the Bible , not just magazines and books , with our ministry . ”
Nevertheless , we should want to have a reputation for skillful use of God’s Word to persuade others to accept the Kingdom message .
God’s will is that all sorts of men “ come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Jehovah is also patient , and his patience affords opportunities for many to attain to repentance .
We want to give them an opportunity to hear God’s message of salvation .
Our next article offers help . [ Footnote ]

“ When Priscilla and Aquila heard [ Apollos ] , they took him into their company and expounded the way of God more correctly to him . ” ​ — ACTS 18 : 26 .
He was “ aglow with the spirit , ” and was “ teaching with correctness the things about Jesus . ”
The problem was that it did not go far enough .
Why did the background of Apollos not prevent Priscilla and Aquila from teaching him ?
Born of Jewish stock , Apollos had apparently been reared in the city of Alexandria .
Hence , the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures known as the Septuagint was produced there .
Did the eloquence of Apollos intimidate them ?
Aquila and his wife were able to ‘ handle the word of the truth aright . ’
Evidently , they were serious students of the Scriptures .
“ He that is walking with wise persons will become wise , ” says Proverbs 13 : 20 .
The account in Acts states that Paul “ would give a talk in the synagogue [ in Corinth ] every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks . ”
Later , when he was joined by Silas and Timothy , Paul “ began to be intensely occupied with the word , witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ . ”
In harmony with Paul’s example , Priscilla and Aquila helped Apollos to understand Christian teachings more correctly .

What approach is often effective in starting home Bible studies ?
To that end , may we ‘ handle the word of the truth aright . ’
As we prayerfully rely on Jehovah , we can share in helping some to become disciples of Jesus Christ .
Let us therefore ‘ do our utmost to present ourselves approved to God , ’ always honoring Jehovah as zealous Kingdom proclaimers , who preach with the purpose of making disciples . ​ — 2 Timothy 2 : 15 .

Under the heading “ Before and After , ” the calendar showed how the educational work of Jehovah’s Witnesses helps people to improve their morals , abandon ruinous life - styles , strengthen their family life , and nurture a personal relationship with God .
“ I was so very moved by the calendar .
As a result , I am inspired to continue making changes in my own life .
“ When I was 11 , I started smoking ; later I used drugs .
When I came to know Jehovah , I was helped to quit those habits .
This calendar is very important to me .
The examples of my brothers and sisters from around the world make me strong .
“ Oh , how powerful God’s Word really is !
Among those who watched the program was Anna - Paula , who lived just 35 miles [ 60 km ] from Bethel .
How surprised she was to learn that all those serving at Bethel are ministers who volunteer their time !
After a brief discussion regarding the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses , she agreed to have a Witness call on her .

A sacred song penned by King David of ancient Israel draws attention to the Source of true happiness , Jehovah .
As recorded at Psalm 37 : 1 , what advice does David give , and why is heeding it appropriate today ?
How easy it is to be affected by the apparent success and prosperity of wicked people !
The seeming success of evildoers may even prompt feelings of envy .
And there is really no need for us to become “ heated up . ”
Why are evildoers likened to grass ?
The psalmist answers : “ For like grass they will speedily wither , and like green new grass they will fade away . ”
Green new grass may look pretty , but the blades soon shrivel and die .
When we are beset by anxieties or even by doubts , our confidence needs to be firmly placed in Jehovah .
Likewise , when we endeavor to walk in faithfulness , we need Jehovah’s support . ​ — Isaiah 50 : 10 .
How can participation in the Christian ministry help us to avoid being unduly disturbed by the prosperity of the wicked ?
In the face of increasing wickedness , we need to be fully occupied with helping others .
During Solomon’s reign its boundaries reached from Dan in the north to Beer - sheba in the south .
What is the result when we “ deal with faithfulness ” ?
Our faithfully persevering in preaching the good news wherever we live and to whomever we can certainly brings rewards from Jehovah .
“ The greatest blessing , ” Frank humbly explains , “ is simply that we are still in the truth and are useful to Jehovah . ”
Why not pause after reading a portion and ask yourself , ‘ What did this passage teach me about Jehovah ? ’
This concentrated attention to God’s Word on our part is “ pleasurable ” to Jehovah and delightful to us .
We can make it our aim to learn as much as we can about Jehovah and his ways .
It was this kind of confidence that must have prompted the apostle John to pen the words : “ This is the confidence that we have toward him , that , no matter what it is that we ask according to his will , he hears us . Further , if we know he hears us respecting whatever we are asking , we know we are to have the things asked since we have asked them of him . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 14 , 15 .
As integrity keepers , our greatest delight is to see the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty .
It is our earnest wish that as these individuals return home , they continue to let the light of truth shine in even apparently impenetrable darkness . ​ — Matthew 5 : 14 - 16 .
How does the righteousness of God’s people shine forth ?
But Jehovah opens the eyes of honesthearted ones to help them realize that our public ministry is motivated by love for Jehovah and for neighbor .
In harmony with Psalm 37 : 7 , for what is it now the time , and why ?
The psalmist’s next words are : “ Keep silent before Jehovah and wait longingly for him . Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful , at the man carrying out his ideas . ”
Now is the time to resist ever more strongly the corrupting influence of Satan’s world .
And now is the time to maintain moral purity and never jeopardize our righteous standing with Jehovah .
For evildoers themselves will be cut off , but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth . ”
It will take complete control of the world’s affairs and remove all opposers of God’s Kingdom . ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 .
In the new world under God’s Kingdom , search as you may , you will not be able to find a “ wicked one . ”
What security that will bring ​ — no locks , no bars , nothing that will mar complete trust and happiness ! ​ — Isaiah 65 : 20 ; Micah 4 : 4 ; 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
Brothers appointed as shepherds lovingly minister to our spiritual ​ — and at times even physical — ​ needs , enabling us to endure affliction for righteousness ’ sake .
Christians ‘ are not envious of those doing unrighteousness ’

What contrast do we observe between the Christian congregation and the world under Satan’s control ?
What warning do we need to heed , and what questions will we consider ?
In what practical ways can we demonstrate that we are truly thankful ?
It is to Jehovah God , our Creator and Life - Giver , that we owe our gratitude , especially as we consider some of the bounteous gifts he has showered upon us .
Our planet’s rich storehouse of life - sustaining minerals , the atmosphere’s finely balanced mixture of vital gases , and the intricate cycles in nature all testify to the debt we owe our loving heavenly Father .
“ Many things you yourself have done , O Jehovah my God , ” sang King David , “ even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us ; there is none to be compared to you .
Were I inclined to tell and speak of them , they have become more numerous than I can recount . ” ​ — Psalm 40 : 5 .
Most readily agree that these characterize human society today .
When shown the description of the fruitage of God’s spirit and upon being invited to the local Kingdom Hall to see evidence of this for themselves , many quickly acknowledge : “ God is really among you . ”
Truly , this upbuilding association is reason for giving thanks to Jehovah , the one who supplies his spirit to make it possible . ​ — Zephaniah 3 : 9 ; Ephesians 3 : 20 , 21 .
5 , 6 .
In the Mosaic Law , Jehovah provided three ways by which the Israelites could show their genuine appreciation for his goodness .
When the Israelites obeyed , Jehovah blessed them abundantly .
What distinguished voluntary offerings from tithing ?
Second , in addition to the tithing requirement , Jehovah arranged for the Israelites to make voluntary contributions .
He instructed Moses to tell the Israelites : “ On your coming into the land where I am bringing you , it must also occur that when you eat any of the bread of the land , you should make a contribution to Jehovah . ”
Note that no specific amount of these firstfruits was required .
What did Jehovah teach through the provision of gleaning ?
“ When you people reap the harvest of your land , ” God instructed , “ you must not reap the edge of your field completely , and the gleaning of your harvest you must not pick up .
Also , you must not gather the leftovers of your vineyard , and you must not pick up the scattered grapes of your vineyard .
For the afflicted one and the alien resident you should leave them .
I am Jehovah your God . ” Once again , no specific amount was required .
What were the consequences for the people of Israel when they failed to show themselves thankful ?
Jehovah blessed the Israelites when they obediently brought in the tithes , gave voluntary contributions , and made provision for the poor .
What , then , are the lessons for us ?
Nevertheless , the apostle Paul urged the Hebrew Christians : “ Let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name . ”
What lesson comes from the arrangements for voluntary contributions and gleaning ?
In addition , we can profit from considering the other two provisions by which the Israelites could show their appreciation ​ — voluntary contributions and gleaning .
Jehovah God well knows our circumstances .
He does not expect that we will all give the same amount , nor can we do so .
[ Pictures on page 18 ]
1 , 2 .
In many respects , such calamities have increased in scope and severity .
All this testifies that we are living in “ critical times . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 .
But Jesus admonished his followers : “ Keep on the watch , therefore , because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming . ”
Jesus here encourages us not only to be watchful but to “ keep on the watch . ”
We must have firm conviction that “ the end of all things has drawn close . ”
( b ) What is one similarity between Noah’s day and the presence of the Son of man ?
People were so bad that Jehovah “ felt hurt at his heart . ”
Warned of “ Things Not Yet Beheld ”
In Noah’s day , Jehovah declared : “ My spirit shall not act toward man indefinitely in that he is also flesh . Accordingly his days shall amount to a hundred and twenty years . ”
Only 120 years more and Jehovah would bring “ the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force of life is active from under the heavens . ” ​ — Genesis 6 : 17 .
8 , 9 .
What warnings have been given in modern times , and how are these being declared ?
In modern times , sincere students of the Bible have learned from the inspired Scriptures that this system is doomed to destruction .
This warning is not to be taken lightly .
Almighty God always keeps his word .
Yet , Noah proved to be ‘ righteous before Jehovah among that generation . ’ ​ — Genesis 7 : 1 .
How has the world today become “ filled with violence ” ?
Violence has been with mankind throughout the ages .
But as was true in the days of Noah , our time has also witnessed it on an unprecedented scale .
The earth has again become filled with violence .
Why ?
( b ) Of what outcome can we be confident ?
Furthermore , they now lack the ability to materialize human bodies on earth in order to enjoy illicit fleshly pleasures .
Jehovah obliterated the pre - Flood world after disobedient angels and their offspring had filled it with badness .
However , those staying watchful today know that their deliverance is near .
What is the fourth similarity between the days of Noah and our day ?
He was also “ a preacher . ”
Similarly , as Jehovah’s Witnesses diligently fulfill their commission to preach , the message of God’s Kingdom is being declared worldwide .
Indeed , the good news of God’s Kingdom is being preached “ in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ”
How does the response of many to our preaching activity compare with that of most people in Noah’s day ?
The end did come though .
Out of all mankind , one family , “ a few people , that is , eight souls , were carried safely through the water . ”
Jesus himself said : “ Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life , and few are the ones finding it . ”
But they may well have a privilege similar to that given to the Flood survivors .
“ Keep on the Watch ”
21 , 22 . ( a ) How has this consideration of the Flood account benefited you ?
Surrounding the domain of the spiritual paradise is Satan’s world , ready to assimilate any who have become spiritually drowsy .
• How should reflecting upon the similarities between Noah’s day and our day affect our sense of urgency ?
The yeartext for 2004 will be : “ Keep on the watch . . .
Prove yourselves ready . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 42 , 44 .
Noah heeded a divine warning .
Do we respond similarly ?
Prove Yourself Ready for Jehovah’s Day
“ Prove yourselves ready , because at an hour that you do not think to be it , the Son of man is coming . ” ​ — MATTHEW 24 : 44 .
Why should we be concerned about Jehovah’s day ?
IT WILL be a day of battle and fury , of anguish and distress , of darkness and desolation .
2 , 3 .
“ Concerning that day and hour nobody knows , neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son , but only the Father , ” said Jesus .
Since we do not know the precise time , it is vital that we take to heart the words of our yeartext for 2004 : “ Keep on the watch . . .
Indicating how suddenly those who are ready will be gathered to safety while others will be forsaken , Jesus said : “ Two men will be in the field : one will be taken along and the other be abandoned ; two women will be grinding at the hand mill : one will be taken along and the other be abandoned . ”
“ By faith Noah , after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld , showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household , ” states the Bible .
Neither Noah’s building project nor his preaching moved the people of his day to act .
Because they were “ eating and drinking , men marrying and women being given in marriage . ”
The Scriptures tell us : “ They were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building . But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all . ”
What attitude must we avoid ?
Similarly , marriage is an arrangement of God .
Only a limited time remains for us to finish our God - given Kingdom - preaching work .
If that is the case , then we need to make this a matter of prayer .
According to Revelation 16 : 14 - 16 , why is it important to resist spiritual drowsiness ?
The outer garments mentioned here refer to what identifies us as Christian Witnesses of Jehovah .
We must resist falling into a state of spiritual drowsiness or lethargy .
Why does daily Bible reading help us to remain spiritually alert ?
For personal study to produce benefits , however , it must be progressive and consistent .
Finding time for it in this day and age may be a challenge .
Regular personal study is essential if we are to stay “ healthy in the faith ” and keep awake . ​ — Titus 1 : 13 .
How do Christian meetings , assemblies , and conventions help us fight spiritual drowsiness ?
At these gatherings , are we not regularly reminded of the nearness of the day of Jehovah ?
How does the Christian ministry help keep us awake spiritually ?
We are also helped to remain awake when we share wholeheartedly in the Christian ministry .
“ Brace up your minds for activity , ” said the apostle Peter , “ keep your senses completely . ”
As described at Luke 21 : 34 - 36 , what life - styles does Jesus warn against ?
How can we avoid being weighed down by anxieties concerning our family ?
Anxiety may also be brought on by materialistic pursuits .
Others have been enticed by get - rich - quick schemes and risky financial investments .
What a dangerous situation to be in as the day of Jehovah nears !
To avoid being drawn into a materialistic life - style , what ability must we cultivate ?
This ability is developed by regularly partaking of ‘ solid spiritual food belonging to mature people ’ and by ‘ having our perceptive powers trained through use . ’
Making sure “ of the more important things ” when setting priorities will also safeguard us from making wrong choices . ​ — Philippians 1 : 10 .
The apostle Peter assures us : “ Jehovah’s day will come as a thief , in which the heavens will pass away with a hissing noise , but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved , and earth and the works in it will be discovered . ”
Do You Recall ?
[ Pictures on page 20 , 21 ]
‘ We are only 12 years old .
We wait for peace .
‘ We want to attend school and to visit our friends and family without fear of abduction .
Will we ever live to see a world without war ?
In recent years , there have been international efforts to resolve some civil wars by pressuring opposing sides to sign a peace accord .
Not infrequently , the flames of conflict flare up again just a few weeks or months after a cease - fire is signed .
The book of Revelation speaks of a critical period in history during which a symbolic horseman would “ take peace away from the earth . ”
Furthermore , this same psalm specifically mentions the destruction of the weapons of Bible times ​ — the bow and the spear .
Sadly , even children are being trained to kill .
At the age of 14 , Alhaji became a decommissioned soldier .
Today , Alhaji finds it difficult to forget war and to adjust to civilian life .
In developed countries , the appalling situation of the child soldier may seem a world away .
Even so , many Western children are learning to wage war in the comfort of their homes .
He was a teenager who enjoyed practicing martial arts .
On April 1 , 2000 , he emulated in real life the aggression of his screen hero .
In an orgy of violence , he killed his father , his mother , and his sister with the very sword his father had given him .
“ I wanted to be alone in the world ; I didn’t want my parents looking for me , ” he explained to the police .
Lasting peace can never be established while people are learning to kill .
Consider the example of Hortêncio .
“ Even today I still remember everything I did .
Before long , he and two of his companions were expelled from the army , and they dedicated their lives to Jehovah God .
“ I saw that by fighting in the war , I was actually sinning against Jehovah , for God says that we should not kill our neighbor .
God has the will and the means to preserve lasting peace .
Jesus has every confidence in this promise .
That is why he taught his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom to come and for God’s will to be done on earth .
When that sincere request is finally answered , war will never again blight the surface of the earth .
For an examination of the evidence that we are living in the last days , see chapter 11 of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Bible education promotes true peace
“ Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength .
DAVID , the son of Jesse , grew up as a shepherd lad in the vicinity of Bethlehem .
An unnamed psalmist addressed faithful worshipers with these inspired words : “ Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength .
Those who have a close relationship with Jehovah are thrilled to respond to that exhortation .
Why do humans ascribe glory to God ?
The Israelites of Isaiah’s day glorified God with their lips , but most lacked sincerity .
He said : “ My Father is glorified in this , that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples . ”
A major theme of Romans is that only those who exercise faith in Jesus Christ can be saved .
How did Paul apply Psalm 19 : 4 ?
Then Paul logically asks : “ How will they call on him in whom they have not put faith ?
How , in turn , will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard ?
Of Israel , Paul says : “ They did not all obey the good news . ”
Yes , even as the inanimate creation glorifies Jehovah , first - century Christians preached the good news of salvation everywhere and thus praised God in “ all the earth . ”
Likely , Paul wrote his letter to the Colossians about 27 years after the death of Jesus Christ .
The activities of those Christians soon came to the attention of the religious leaders .
What opposition began to manifest itself , and how did true Christians respond ?
Were they discouraged by the persecution ?
By no means .
We read : “ Those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word . ”
In Acts chapter 9 , we read that the Pharisee Saul of Tarsus , while traveling to Damascus to initiate persecution of Jesus ’ disciples there , saw a vision of Jesus and was struck blind .
12 , 13 . ( a ) According to historians , what was noteworthy about the early Christian congregation ?
( b ) How do the book of Acts and the words of Paul agree with the statements of historians ?
Williams states : “ The general testimony is that all Christians in the primitive Church , especially those who had the charismatic gift [ gifts of the spirit ] , preached the gospel . ”
Clearly , all faithful Christians in the first century felt the same way .
Indeed , a genuine Christian has to share in the preaching work because it is inseparably linked to faith .
Is it only a small group within the congregation ​ — like a clergy class — ​ that exercises faith and thus has the responsibility to preach ?
* Of course not !
Because all loyal Christians in the first century of our Common Era demonstrated their faith in this way , a great shout of praise to Jehovah’s name was heard .
For example , Acts chapter 6 records a disagreement between Hebrew - speaking and Greek - speaking converts .
Later , political tensions developed between King Herod Agrippa of Judea and the people of Tyre and Sidon .
Instantly , Jehovah’s angel struck Herod Agrippa , and he died “ because he did not give the glory to God . ”
In the first century , what did increasing numbers join in doing ?
( a ) What difference is noted between the first - century Christian congregation and Christendom today ?
( b ) What will be considered in the next article ?
In Acts , however , the growth was conversion growth , for the church was just beginning its work . ”
• In what ways do we glorify God ?

The preaching work and prayer are closely linked
For example , Cain murders his righteous brother Abel .
1 : 16 ​ — How could God produce light on the first day if the luminaries were not made until the fourth day ?
The sources of that light still remained invisible from the earth .
3 : 8 ​ — Did Jehovah God speak to Adam directly ?
The effects of the cursed ground , with its thorns and thistles , were so keenly felt by Adam’s descendants that Noah’s father , Lamech , spoke of “ the pain of our hands resulting from the ground which Jehovah has cursed . ”
The Bible does not say that a sign or a mark was placed on Cain’s person in any way .
Animal flesh was not a part of man’s diet prior to the Flood .
The waters “ above ” were huge quantities of moisture suspended high above the earth , forming a “ vast watery deep . ”
Lessons for Us :
4 : 3 - 7 .
6 : 22 .
Although it took many years to build the ark , Noah did just what God had commanded .
Noah’s three sons become the progenitors of the entire human race , but his great - grandson Nimrod becomes “ a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah . ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
Since the olive is quite a hardy tree , it might have remained alive under water for some months during the Deluge .
Though Canaan’s father , Ham , witnessed this , he did not interfere but appears to have spread the story .
Peleg lived from 2269 to 2030 B.C.E .
No human scheme or effort can thwart Jehovah’s purpose .
Assyrians , Chaldeans , Hebrews , Syrians , and some Arabian tribes , are descendants of Shem .
Ethiopians , Egyptians , Canaanites , and some African and Arabian tribes descended from Ham .
The first part of the book of Genesis contains the only accurate account of early human history .
As you do the weekly Bible reading in preparation for the Theocratic Ministry School , considering what is stated under the section “ Scriptural Questions Answered ” will help you to understand some of the difficult Scriptural passages .
When appropriate , they can also provide the basis for a local needs part on the Service Meeting .
DO YOU find yourself laboring under an emotional load because of problems with your family , health , work , or other weighty responsibilities ?
And who today is not affected by injustice , crime , and violence ?
Will he come to our aid ? ’
Solomon trusted that God not only knows us but also cares about us as individuals .
He promises to respond to heartfelt prayers that are in harmony with his will .
Yes , Jehovah listens to “ whatever prayer , whatever request for favor there may occur on the part of any man or of all [ his ] people . ”
“ Make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit . ” ​ — MATTHEW 28 : 19 .
He told them : “ Make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit . ”
What a staggering task that was !
How would such a small group reach “ people of all the nations ” ?
What obscured the pure Christian “ wheat ” from view ?
However , Jesus had prophesied that the time would come when Satan would sow “ weeds ” and the true Christian “ wheat ” would be overshadowed for many centuries until harvesttime .
Nevertheless , Jehovah’s anointed servants , like their first - century brothers , set about the task before them with full faith in Jehovah , and his spirit was with them .
These would ‘ render Jehovah sacred service day and night . ’
Still , they echoed the words of the psalmist : “ In union with God I shall praise his word . In God I have put my trust ; I shall not be afraid . What can flesh do to me ? ”
What examples demonstrate the fine record of missionaries ?
Over the years , graduates of Gilead and , more recently , graduates of the Ministerial Training School have built up a magnificent record .
Consider Japan .
Before the second world war , there were about one hundred Kingdom preachers in that land .
“ Out of All . . .
15 , 16 .
However , those who have left their homeland to serve in other countries try to learn the local languages so as to make the good news more accessible to those “ rightly disposed for everlasting life . ”
There was also wide disagreement on how the language should be written .
Since they had little knowledge of the truth , I had to sit with them to make sure that each sentence was accurate . ”
Nevertheless , the tract Life in a New World was eventually translated into four Namibian languages .
In recent times , millions have fled to foreign lands as refugees , or they have migrated for economic reasons .
In Italy , for example , there are congregations and groups in 22 languages besides Italian .
To help brothers to preach to people who speak other languages , classes were recently organized to teach 16 languages , including Italian Sign Language .
“ Into All the Earth ”
Explain .
Last year , a new peak of 16,097,622 attended the observance of the Memorial of Jesus ’ death .
Clearly , there is still much to be done .
May we continue to imitate the firm integrity of our brothers who have endured intense persecution .
• What task did the brothers begin to undertake in 1919 , and why was it a challenge ?
( See bound volume )
The chaos of the second world war did not cause Christians to doubt that the good news would be preached

Would You Welcome a Visit ?
Even in this troubled world , you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God , his Kingdom , and his wonderful purpose for mankind .
Jehovah displays humility in showing mercy to sinners , and David appreciated God’s undeserved kindness .
Said David : “ Yours is the kingdom , O Jehovah , the One also lifting yourself up as head over all . ”
“ I will exalt you , O my God the King , ” he sang , “ and I will bless your name to time indefinite , even forever .
They treasure their hope of everlasting life under Kingdom rule because they desire to praise Jehovah throughout eternity .
Already , millions have started to do so by exercising faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice and by serving Jehovah obediently out of love as his dedicated , baptized worshipers . ​ — Romans 5 : 8 ; 1 John 5 : 3 .
Grateful praise and thankfulness can be expressed when we are moved by God’s way of dealing with his people or when we are thrilled by a certain aspect of his marvelous creation .
We also bless Jehovah God when we discuss his purposes with fellow believers at Christian meetings or during private conversations .
Recent examples of such fine works include the construction of many places of worship by Jehovah’s people in poverty - stricken lands .
And do you regularly speak to others about his Kingdom ?
Give a major reason to praise Jehovah .
Psalm 145 : 3 gives a major reason for praising Jehovah .
It cannot be fully searched out , comprehended , or measured by humans .
But we will certainly benefit from now considering examples of Jehovah’s unsearchable greatness .
Try to recall an occasion when you were away from bright city lights and looked up into a cloudless night sky .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What aspects of Jehovah’s greatness have been displayed in connection with Jesus Christ ?
Since Jesus ’ resurrection , Jehovah has performed many other great and wonderful works .
Jehovah’s greatness has been manifested in connection with his Kingdom purposes .
What wonderful work did Jehovah perform in 1919 , and what did this accomplish ?
Other anointed ones have been gathered in order to complete the number of 144,000 .
And by means of Christ’s anointed followers , Jehovah laid the foundation of “ a new earth , ” a righteous human society .
In 1935 , the August 1 and August 15 issues of this journal contained key articles dealing with the “ great crowd , ” mentioned in Revelation chapter 7 .
Anointed Christians zealously began to seek out and bring into their association these fellow worshipers from all nations , tribes , peoples , and tongues .
Because of the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work , spearheaded by anointed Christians , over six million people now entertain the hope of endless life in an earthly paradise .
17 , 18 .
Very likely , David noted how Egypt’s false gods were humiliated as God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage .
Such events testify to Jehovah’s dignity and greatness .
For instance , he may have meditated on what happened when Jehovah gave the Law to Israel .
What will increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s dignity ?
As was true in David’s case , reading the Scriptures regularly , meditating on them deeply , and studying them diligently will increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s dignity .
As we have noted , the first six verses of Psalm 145 : 1 - 6 give us sound reasons to praise Jehovah for things associated with his unsearchable greatness .
[ Credit Line ]
“ Jehovah is . . . great in loving - kindness . ” ​ — PSALM 145 : 8 .
How far - reaching is God’s love ?
“ GOD is love . ”
Jehovah shows love for his true worshipers in a precious , lasting way .
Identifying God’s Loyal Ones
Who are such “ loyal ones ” ?
King David supplies the answer .
You may wonder how humans can bless God .
Jehovah’s loyal ones can be identified as those who use their mouths to speak well of him .
Why , it is Jehovah’s Kingdom !
It pleases Jehovah very much when his loyal ones speak well of him , and he remembers them .
Unlike human governments , which will soon pass away , his kingship is eternal .
Jehovah thus fulfilled his promise that David’s kingship would be firmly established to time indefinite . ​ — 2 Samuel 7 : 12 , 13 ; Luke 1 : 32 , 33 .
Benefiting From Jehovah’s Sovereignty
9 , 10 .
Of course , some human rulers are sincerely concerned about the welfare of their subjects .
Some suffer from chronic illness or because of bereavement .
At times , the mistakes of Jehovah’s loyal ones may cause them to ‘ bow down ’ in discouragement .
Whatever trial befalls them , however , Jehovah is always ready to give comfort and spiritual strength to each one of them .
This includes satisfying them with nourishing food .
David mentioned that “ every living thing ” gets satisfied .
If it were not for earth’s abundant vegetation of the land and plants of the sea , aquatic creatures , birds , and land animals would have no oxygen to breathe or food to eat .
The remnant of the 144,000 anointed ones make up that slave class today .
All this spiritual food has been a blessing to true worshipers around the earth .
Jehovah God .
Through such provisions , “ the desire of every living thing ” in the present - day spiritual paradise gets satisfied .
16 , 17 . ( a ) What examples are there of spiritual food that came in the right season ?
Consider a striking example of spiritual food received in the right season .
In that same year , the November 1 issue of The Watchtower contained an article entitled “ Neutrality . ”
This brought upon them the wrath of governments on both sides of that six - year conflict .
Moreover , their striking record of integrity during that war continues to help people to identify the true religion . ​ — Isaiah 2 : 2 - 4 .
The spiritual food that Jehovah provides is not only timely but also richly satisfying .
While the nations were in the thick of battle during World War II , Jehovah’s people were helped to focus on something far more important than their own salvation .
Unlike Satan , who slanders Jehovah and his way of ruling , Jehovah’s loyal ones continue to declare publicly : “ Jehovah is righteous in all his ways . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 17 .
Another example of timely , satisfying spiritual food is the book Draw Close to Jehovah , which was released at hundreds of “ Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers ” District Conventions held around the world in 2002 / 03 .
What crucial time draws near , and how can we deal with it ?
The desire of those fearing him he will perform , and their cry for help he will hear , and he will save them .
Now more than ever before is the time for those who fear Jehovah to “ call upon him in trueness . ”
By doing so , we have the wonderful prospect of being included among those who will exalt , bless , and praise Jehovah “ all day long ” and “ even forever . ”
• How does Jehovah ‘ satisfy the desire of every living thing ’ ?
Jehovah provides food for “ every living thing ”

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Book of Genesis ​ — II
The first 10 chapters as well as 9 verses of the 11th chapter Ge 1 : 1 – 11 : 9 , covering the account from creation to the tower of Babel , were discussed in the preceding issue of this magazine .
( Genesis 11 : 10 – 23 : 20 )
The death of his beloved wife , Sarah , brings much sorrow to Abraham .
The Abrahamic covenant is “ a covenant to time indefinite . ”
15 : 13 ​ — When was the foretold 400 - year affliction of Abram’s offspring fulfilled ?
Sarai’s offer was in line with the custom of the day ​ — that a barren wife was obligated to provide her husband with a concubine in order to produce an heir .
The practice of polygamy first appeared in the line of Cain .
However , Jehovah never abandoned his original standard of monogamy .
Noah and his sons , to whom the command to ‘ be fruitful and fill the earth ’ was repeated , were evidently all monogamous .
By the time he offered his daughters , Lot likely realized that his guests were messengers from God , and he may have reasoned that God could protect his daughters as He had protected his aunt Sarah in Egypt .
Jehovah condones neither incest nor drunkenness .
The very fact that Lot’s daughters got him intoxicated suggests that they realized that he would not consent to having sexual relations with them while he was sober .
What a beautiful model Abraham provides in handling differences !
15 : 5 , 6 .
If we open our hearts to Jehovah in prayer , accept his reassurances from the Bible , and obey him , our faith will be strengthened .
Jehovah withheld the execution of his judgment upon the Amorites ( or , Canaanites ) for four generations .
Why ?
Because he is a patient God .
He waited until all hope of improvement was gone .
( Genesis 24 : 1 – 36 : 43 )
Jacob’s concern about obtaining the birthright and his wrestling all night with an angel to get a blessing show that he truly appreciated sacred things .

Lessons for Us :
The account of their lives , contained in the book of Genesis , is truly faith - strengthening and teaches us many valuable lessons .
Do you ?
What prompted this request ?
Prayer was a regular part of Jewish life and worship .
So the disciple was not asking to be taught something that he knew nothing about or that he had never done .
Possibly this particular disciple was not present at that time , so Jesus kindly repeated the essential points of that model prayer .
It consists of seven requests , of which three concern God’s purposes and four concern our material and spiritual needs . In this article , we will consider the first three petitions .
What is implied by our addressing Jehovah as “ our Father ” ?
From the outset , Jesus showed that our prayers should reflect an intimate yet respectful relationship with Jehovah .
Spirit - begotten Christians are adopted as “ God’s sons , ” and to him they can “ cry out : ‘ Abba , Father ! ’ ”
Love for Jehovah’s Name
Furthermore , through the centuries , Jehovah’s name has been reproached by the shameful acts and teachings of those claiming to represent him .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What is the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray ?
The second petition in the model prayer is : “ Let your kingdom come . ”
Such is the heavenly government for which Christ taught his followers to pray .
In his model prayer , Christ taught us to pray for the coming of God’s Kingdom .
Certainly .
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ” ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 .
Yes , may Jesus come to sanctify Jehovah’s name and vindicate His sovereignty , so that the psalmist’s words may come true : “ That people may know that you , whose name is Jehovah , you alone are the Most High over all the earth . ” ​ — Psalm 83 : 18 .
11 , 12 . ( a ) What are we asking for when we pray for God’s will to “ take place , as in heaven , also upon earth ” ?
Jehovah has a purpose for “ the things in the heavens and the things on the earth . ”
Jehovah’s Will in Heaven
The book of Proverbs portrays God’s firstborn Son as wisdom personified .
It shows that over untold aeons of time , God’s only - begotten Son was “ glad before him all the time , ” happy to do his Father’s will .
We read : “ Jehovah himself has firmly established his throne in the very heavens ; and over everything his own kingship has held domination .
Bless Jehovah , all you armies of his , you ministers of his , doing his will .
He inspired the prophet Isaiah to write : “ This is what Jehovah has said , the Creator of the heavens , He the true God , the Former of the earth and the Maker of it , He the One who firmly established it , who did not create it simply for nothing , who formed it even to be inhabited : ‘ I am Jehovah , and there is no one else . ’ ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What must be done before God’s will fully takes place on the earth ?
Jehovah’s sovereignty will be vindicated and his name sanctified .
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also upon earth . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 9 , 10 .
Jehovah Provides Our Daily Needs
First , it reminds us that Jehovah is the Great Provider .
What we eat and drink is a gift from God .
Asking him to supply us with our daily needs shows him that we do not take such provisions for granted .
Jesus further stated : “ Never be anxious and say , ‘ What are we to eat ? ’
Our prayer for daily bread should also remind us of our need for daily spiritual food .
Although very hungry after a long fast , Jesus resisted Satan’s temptation to turn stones into bread , saying : “ It is written , ‘ Man must live , not on bread alone , but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth . ’ ”
The way in which Jehovah supplied the manna provided the Israelites not only with physical food but also with spiritual lessons .
We likewise need to feed daily on spiritual food provided by Jehovah through his Son .
But Jesus ’ model prayer teaches us even more about what we must do to obtain forgiveness of our sins .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What comment did Jesus add to the model prayer , and what did this underscore ?
( b ) How did Jesus further illustrate our need to be forgiving ?
Interestingly , the request “ forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors , ” is the only part of the model prayer that Jesus commented on .
But , besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union . ” All of this is implied in the prayer Jesus taught us : “ Forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . ”
Did Jesus mean that we should ask Jehovah not to tempt us ?
Furthermore , the psalmist wrote : “ If errors were what you watch , O Jah , O Jehovah , who could stand ? ”
Our prayer is for us to remain in “ the secret place of the Most High , ” receiving the spiritual protection afforded those who recognize Jehovah’s sovereignty in all they do . ​ — Psalm 91 : 1 - 3 .
“ Deliver Us From the Wicked One ”
Why is it more important than ever to pray for deliverance from the wicked one ?
Our prime concern should be the sanctification of Jehovah’s great and holy name .
Our hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth depends on the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the recognition throughout the universe of his righteous sovereignty .
Satan is well aware that he has only “ a short period of time ” left to vent his “ great anger ” on the earth , particularly on Jehovah’s faithful servants .
As we see these occur , our hope for deliverance will become brighter .
The succinct model prayer Jesus gave his disciples provides us with a sound guide as to what to include in our prayers as the end draws near .
The Jerome Biblical Commentary states : “ The doxology . . . is not found in the most reliable [ manuscripts ] . ”
• Explain the prayer “ forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . ”
• Why do we need to pray “ deliver us from the wicked one ” ?
Not to be overlooked are the forward steps that have been taken in education , in transportation , and in human rights , all of which have improved life for millions .
In any case , you will likely agree with what the apostle Paul wrote long ago : “ The scene of this world is changing . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 7 : 31 .
Not so today , when the course of history can shift in the time it takes for an assassin’s bullet to find its mark !
Rather , they are eagerly looking for indications that the drama is reaching its climax ​ — a catastrophic finish — ​ for they know that this system must end before Jehovah ushers in the long - awaited new world of righteousness .
* Let us therefore examine two lines of evidence that demonstrate that we are living in the time of the end and that the new world is at hand .
When would “ the appointed times of the nations ” end and God’s Kingdom rule begin ?
They also came to realize that 1914 was the beginning of the end for this system of things .
Since Jehovah used King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to destroy Jerusalem at the beginning of “ the appointed times , ” in 607 B.C.E . , He revealed through that ruler that the nations would continue without divine interference for a total of seven symbolic times .
Thus , seven times must be twice that long , or 2,520 days .
Is that the end of it ?
Therefore , the seven times would actually be 2,520 years long .
Jorge A .
Has that been your personal experience ?
How does the Bible enlighten us about the cause of worsening world conditions since 1914 ?
What ongoing efforts have there been to bring peace in our time ?
It may even kick her .
The coming destruction will be fear - inspiring for faithful Christians watching from the sidelines .
“ Because the days are wicked . ”
Knowing that dissolution awaits the entire worldly system of things , how should we be affected personally ?
The apostle Peter wrote for our benefit : “ Since all these things are thus to be dissolved , what sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion ! ”
Although living and working in the world , we should heed the wise counsel not to use the world to the full .
This world will not succeed in working out solutions to its problems .
The memorial tombs will be emptied , and billions of resurrected ones ​ — more players — ​ will come into view .
What joy there will be as one generation is reunited with another and when long - separated loved ones hug one another in a warm , heartfelt embrace !
[ Footnotes ]
In a different context , Paul spoke of anointed Christians as being “ a theatrical spectacle to the world , and to angels , and to men . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 4 : 9 .
For example , regarding the identity of “ the king of the north , ” mentioned at Daniel 11 : 40 , 44 , 45 , see the book Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy , pages 280 - 1 .
• How have the apostle Paul’s words “ the scene of this world is changing ” proved true in our time ?

“ More than all else that is to be guarded , safeguard your heart , for out of it are the sources of life . ” ​ — PROVERBS 4 : 23 .
THE painting may have seemed old - fashioned .
Thus , they give it up for a small return .
Some trade in their chastity for a few moments of sexual gratification .
Safeguard Your Heart
It is not the literal organ .
The Bible says : “ You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force . ”
God’s Word says : “ He that is trusting in his own heart is stupid , but he that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape . ”
( b ) How do we know that imperfect humans can reflect Jehovah’s holiness ?
One way to do so is to contemplate the true value of chastity .
In fact , the Bible says that “ Holiness belongs to Jehovah . ”
Yes , we can imitate Jehovah’s holiness ; we can be clean before him , maintaining our chastity .
So when we refrain from unclean , defiling acts , we are reaching out for a lofty , thrilling privilege ​ — that of reflecting a beautiful trait of the Most High God !
We should not assume that it is out of our reach to do so , for Jehovah is a wise and reasonable Master who never demands more of us than we are able to do .
After all , they have shown us more love than we can ever begin to repay .
( a ) How can we nourish the figurative heart ?
To safeguard our heart , there are serious dangers we must avoid .
Paul said : “ Flee from fornication . ”
If we ignore that counsel , we increase the likelihood of becoming involved in serious immorality and losing God’s favor .
Within minutes , though , she sees the boy teetering on his toes at the very edge of the puddle .
The pornography plague has proliferated in magazines , books , videos , and on the Internet .
Let us learn from faithful Job , who made a covenant ​ — a formal agreement — ​ with his own eyes , not to expose them to what would only tempt him to do wrong .
How may Christian couples “ flee from fornication ” during courtship ?
Christians who enter into courtship with those who do not serve Jehovah are likely to face terrible challenges .
It is vital that Christians yoke themselves only to those who love Jehovah and respect his standards of chastity .
14 , 15 . ( a ) What mistaken view do some entertain regarding the meaning of “ fornication ” ?
Some in today’s world have adopted a false idea as to the meaning of “ fornication . ”
Avoiding pregnancy out of wedlock is not the same thing as maintaining chastity , and the real definition of “ fornication ” is not so limited or narrow .
Avoid the Dangers of Flirting
What is flirting , and how may the problem be controlled ?
Flirting may be defined this way : to signal romantic interest when there is no real intention to marry .
Hard - and - fast rules , then , cannot really address the matter .
If so , have we considered the pain that we might be causing ?
As a result , romantic feelings have blossomed into an emotional dependency that may undermine and even destroy a marriage .
How should we be determined to view our chastity ?
• What is chastity , and why is it so important ?
[ Picture on page 11 ]
The reason ?
Media reports abound with examples ​ — politicians lying about their actions , accountants and lawyers overstating corporate profits , advertisers misleading consumers , litigants cheating insurance companies , just to name a few .
As Christians , we need to be alert to misleading ideas that could turn us away from the truth .
The apostle John wrote that “ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
That “ wicked one ” is Satan the Devil .
Concerning him , Jesus said : “ He did not stand fast in the truth , because truth is not in him .
In this time of the end , Satan has intensified his efforts .
Apostates may claim to worship Jehovah and to believe the Bible , but they reject the visible part of his organization .
Some even return to the God - dishonoring doctrines of “ Babylon the Great , ” the world empire of false religion .
Most are not content to leave the faith that they once perhaps viewed as true .
What methods do apostates use to achieve their aim ?
Such malicious opposers would tell what is not true with the intent to deceive others .
At the same time , we recognize that our knowledge of God’s purpose is not perfect ; our understanding has undergone adjustments over the years .
Loyal Christians are content to wait on Jehovah for all such refinements .
Why do imperfect humans have a tendency to deceive themselves ?
Our desperate heart may also look for ways to justify questionable conduct .
It is easy to convince ourselves that we can view seedy entertainment without any harm .
If we are to avoid self - deception , there are some helpful suggestions we need to keep in mind .
Listen to others .
Doing so will help you to keep your thoughts , attitudes , and feelings in harmony with godly principles .
15 , 16 . ( a ) In his efforts to deceive us , what lies does Satan use ?
( b ) How can we avoid being deceived by such lies ?
Satan promotes the idea that there is no harm in pursuing an immoral life - style , even though pleasure - seekers often reap bitter consequences .
Hence , he promotes the lie that we are worthless in God’s eyes .
19 , 20 . ( a ) Why is it important to recognize and reject the satanic lie that Jehovah does not love you ?
( b ) How has one traveling overseer helped downhearted ones ?
If you know that someone is lying , you can protect yourself against being deceived .
Again comes the answer , ‘ Of course not ! ’
During this final part of the last days , it is to be expected that Satan will continue to launch an avalanche of lies and deceptions .
Being forewarned , we are forearmed . ​ — 2 Corinthians 2 : 11 .
And let us recognize and reject all of Satan’s lies .
“ PEOPLE in Britain still believe in God but don’t want to make the commitment to Christ , ” says Stephen Tirwomwe , a Ugandan clergyman .
Frustrated with failed efforts to change their church from within , the new mission broke with tradition and joined Asian and African leaders to begin “ a missionary outreach to the United States . ”
Now the tide has turned .
“ The center [ of nominal Christianity ] has changed , ” says Andrew Walls , founder - director of the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non - Western World .
In 1900 , 80 percent of those who claimed to be Christians were either Europeans or North Americans .
A recent press report states : “ Catholic churches in Europe rely on priests from the Philippines and India , ” and “ one in six priests serving in American Catholic parishes is now imported from abroad . ”
One writer observes : “ Christian missionary traffic has gone into reverse gear . ”
A Gathering Storm
“ In Scotland less than 10 percent of Christians regularly go to church , ” notes one newsmagazine .
Even fewer in France and Germany do .
When surveyed , “ about 40 percent of Americans and 20 percent of Canadians say they go to church regularly , ” notes another press report .
As the demographic shift in the church continues southward , the basis for future confrontation is already being laid .
In view of these trends , Walls says that an urgent question is “ how African , Asian , Latin American , North American and European Christians can live together in the same church , authentically expressing the same faith . ”
What do you think ?
This former church is now a music café
JESUS CHRIST’S ministry burst onto the world scene in the first century .
It is not surprising , therefore , that despite intense religious and political persecution , the disciples of Jesus spread his dynamic message rapidly .
The simple truths Jesus had taught enlightened the hearts of humble , righthearted people throughout the Roman Empire . ​ — Ephesians 1 : 17 , 18 .
How , though , would all these new disciples from such diverse economic , cultural , linguistic , and religious backgrounds come together in a truly united “ one faith , ” as the apostle Paul called it ?
The Basis for Christian Unity
He said : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth .
Also , that spirit would produce fruitage , such as love , joy , and peace , which in turn would promote unity among them . ​ — Acts 15 : 28 ; Galatians 5 : 22 , 23 .
Nevertheless , today’s churches are , not united , but divided .
Their beliefs are based on God’s Word .
A parish priest in Belgium wrote about them : “ One thing we can learn from them [ Jehovah’s Witnesses ] is their willingness to listen to God’s Word and their courage to witness about it . ”
The Witness did not take sides with him , nor did he advocate some other political ideology .
How did she respond ?
God’s Servants Are Like Trees ​ — In What Ways ?
SPEAKING about an individual who delights in and applies Bible principles in his life , the psalmist notes : “ He will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water , that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither , and everything he does will succeed . ”
Likewise , the baobab trees of central Africa attain great ages , and a bristlecone pine in California is believed to be some 4,600 years old .
In a forest , mature trees are often beneficial to their surroundings .
Indeed , Christians can stand their ground only if they are firmly rooted in Christ . ​ — 1 Peter 2 : 21 .
Faithful , mature Christians , having widespread spiritual roots , help newer believers to remain firm in the faith , even in the face of stormlike opposition .
How thrilling it is that all of God’s servants have the prospect of experiencing the fulfillment of the promise found at Isaiah 65 : 22 , which states : “ Like the days of a tree will the days of my people be . ”
Godo - Foto
Why is it vital that we receive a regular supply of spiritual food today ?
What a frightening prospect ! ​ — Matthew 24 : 3 , 7 , 8 , 15 - 22 ; Luke 21 : 10 , 11 .
Since 1914 , most aspects of Jesus ’ prophecy have been fulfilled .
The “ pangs of distress ” are upon mankind in full measure .
What arrangements has Jesus made for us to receive “ food at the proper time ” ?
Why not ?
Explain why the term “ faithful and discreet slave ” does not apply to each Christian individually .
The only reasonable conclusion , then , is that Jesus was referring to a group of Christians as “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
Can there be such a thing as a composite slave ?
Still , as a nation , Israel was to represent Jehovah’s sovereignty and tell his praises among the nations .
Hence , the expression “ faithful and discreet slave ” refers to all members of that anointed spiritual nation as a group on earth at any particular time from 33 C.E . until now , just as every Israelite living at any time from 1513 B.C.E . until Pentecost 33 C.E . was part of the pre - Christian servant class .
Consequently , the domestics were also anointed Christians , viewed , not as a group , but as individuals .
10 , 11 .
Jesus ’ words recorded at Mark 13 : 34 make this plain .
So each member of the slave class has received an assignment ​ — to increase Christ’s earthly belongings .
Hence , those anointed ones have the responsibility to minister to one another using the gifts God gave them .
However , each member of the slave class could contribute in some way to the growth of the spiritual nation .
These appointed men were thus privileged to contribute to the growth of the nation in a special way .
Faithful anointed Christian women did not resent that only Christian men were assigned to teach in the congregation .
Zealous anointed sisters today manifest the same humble attitude , whether the appointed elders are of the anointed or not .
What was one of the main sources of spiritual food in the first century , and who took the lead in providing it ?
In this way , representatives of the slave faithfully distributed rich spiritual food to sincere Christians .
16 , 17 .
What about today ?
When Jesus ’ presence began in 1914 , did he find a group of anointed Christians who were faithfully dispensing food at the proper time ?
In this way , the truth of God’s Word reached tens of thousands of readers at once .
In addition , an eight - hour program combining color slides and motion pictures was prepared .
Greater responsibilities now awaited that slave .
Because the Master had received an increase in his belongings .
For example , two decades after Christ’s enthronement in 1914 , “ a great crowd ” of “ other sheep ” was identified .
We are intrigued !
What Do You Think ?
• Who have helped increase the Lord’s belongings in recent decades , and how ?
“ It is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God . ” ​ — 1 Peter 4 : 17 .
What did Jesus encounter when he inspected the “ slave ” ?
Yes , the “ evil slave ” came from the ranks of the faithful slave .
* How ?
As a result of this and other developments , many were disappointed and a few became embittered .
These former Christians came to be identified as the “ evil slave , ” and Jesus punished them with “ the greatest severity . ”
Since those early days , a few other anointed individuals have shown a similar bad spirit , identifying themselves with the “ evil slave . ”
Nonetheless , the faithful and discreet slave went through the same tests as “ that evil slave . ”
As a result , they have been “ a pillar and support of the truth ” during these tumultuous “ last days . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 3 : 15 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 1 .
Then in 1919 something unexpected happened .
Without oil , the lamps would not give light .
Hence , when the call came to give forth light , they were ready . ​ — 2 Timothy 4 : 2 ; Hebrews 10 : 24 , 25 .
In Jesus ’ parable , how did the discreet virgins respond ?
Thus , they passed inspection .
Afterwards the rest of the virgins also came , saying , ‘ Sir , sir , open to us ! ’
In answer he said , ‘ I tell you the truth , I do not know you . ’ ”
How tragic !
He said : “ It is just as when a man , about to travel abroad , summoned slaves of his and committed to them his belongings .
The man in the parable is Jesus himself , who “ went abroad ” when he ascended to heaven in the year 33 C.E .
But before his ascension , Jesus committed “ his belongings ” to his faithful disciples .
How ?
( b ) What new opportunities to ‘ do business ’ were granted to faithful ones ?
The parable continues : “ After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them . ”
It was time to settle accounts .
From 33 C.E . onward , including the years leading up to 1914 , many had been working hard at Jesus ’ “ business . ”
The final members of the wheat class had to be located and “ a great crowd ” of other sheep gathered in . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 ; Matthew 13 : 24 - 30 .
How did faithful anointed Christians ‘ enter into the joy of their master ’ ?
Why did some not pass inspection , and with what result ?
Sadly , some did not pass inspection .
Before 1914 they had not enthusiastically shared their hope with others , and they did not want to start in 1919 .
How did Jesus respond to their insolence ?
Not at all .
The great crowd of other sheep have imitated their anointed brothers .
They are aware that their knowledge of God’s purposes brings great responsibility .
And they let their light shine , sharing in the work of preaching and teaching and thus ‘ doing business ’ along with their anointed brothers .
They must render an account for the way the Lord’s belongings on earth are administered .
Even though they are few in number , they cannot abdicate their responsibility to the great crowd .
These recognize the responsibility of their anointed brothers and feel privileged to work under their oversight .
May all of us , then , take to heart Jesus ’ words : “ Keep on the watch , therefore , because you know neither the day nor the hour . ” ​ — Matthew 25 : 13 .
For another discussion of Jesus ’ parable , see Worldwide Security Under the “ Prince of Peace , ” published by Jehovah’s Witnesses , chapters 5 and 6 .
• Why did some anointed Christians develop the spirit of “ that evil slave ” ?
• How can we show ourselves to be spiritually discreet ?

He does not need to move physically in order to “ come . ”
Thus , in 1914 he “ came ” to begin his presence as enthroned King .

The sluggish slave had not
JEHOVAH’S name and purposes are being declared throughout the earth .
For instance , the apostle Paul urged his fellow Christian overseer Timothy : “ Do the work of an evangelizer , fully accomplish your ministry . ”
What experiences did Philip have as an evangelizer ?
He was one of the “ seven certified men . . . full of spirit and wisdom ” chosen to carry out the impartial daily distribution of food among the Greek - speaking and the Hebrew - speaking Christian widows in Jerusalem .
After Philip’s clear explanation of Isaiah’s prophecy , this “ man in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians ” put faith in Jesus Christ and was baptized .
Philip thereafter went to Ashdod and then to Caesarea , “ declaring the good news to all the cities ” along the way .
Parental zeal for the ministry can have a fine effect on sons and daughters today , moving them to make zealous evangelizing their lifetime work .
And what fine work is being done by men , women , and children serving as zealous Kingdom publishers !
Prophetically , this lifesaving work is likened to putting a mark on the foreheads of those sighing and groaning over the detestable things now taking place .
The fine efforts of humble overseers can do much to help others to be zealous and fruitful evangelizers . ​ — 2 Peter 1 : 5 - 8 .
Christ and his early followers set what example in the ministry ?
What about the apostles themselves ?
In general , those already dedicated to Jehovah would not need instruction about “ repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus . ”
By making return visits , we seek to water it .
And there can be a fine cumulative effect , for Paul wrote : “ I planted , Apollos watered , but God kept making it grow . ”
Why do we repeatedly call at people’s homes ?
If we knew that a person’s life was endangered , would we make only one feeble attempt to help him ?
Not only their circumstances but also the attitude of householders can change .
For instance , the painful loss of a loved one in death may move an individual to listen to the Kingdom message .
How do we benefit from doing the evangelizing work ?
Doing the work of an evangelizer benefits us personally in various ways .
By relying on Jehovah and choosing our words well , we can apply Paul’s counsel : “ Let your utterance be always with graciousness , seasoned with salt , so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one . ” ​ — Colossians 4 : 6 .
In turn , its fruitage ​ — “ love , joy , peace , long - suffering , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self - control ” — ​ becomes evident in our ministry .
20 , 21 .
When people mention their problems ​ — sickness , unemployment , domestic trials — ​ we do not act as advisers , but we share encouraging and comforting scriptures with them .
We are concerned about people who have been blinded spiritually but seem to have a love of righteousness .
That surely is beneficial , since we might otherwise yield to materialistic temptations so common in this world .
22 , 23 . ( a ) What treasures are stored up by Christian evangelizers ?
Jesus showed this when he said : “ Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break in and steal .
Rather , store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust consumes , and where thieves do not break in and steal . For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 19 - 21 .
“ Do your service thoroughly . ” ​ — 2 TIMOTHY 4 : 5 , Byington .
Though all Christians are evangelizers , what is Scripturally required of elders ?
Under all circumstances , an elder’s teaching must be spiritually healthful , for the apostle Paul told the overseer Timothy : “ There will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching , but , in accord with their own desires , they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled ; and they will turn their ears away from the truth , whereas they will be turned aside to false stories .
Fully accomplishing our ministry does not always require more time , but it does call for time well spent .
And all servants of Jehovah should share regularly in the Kingdom - preaching work . ​ — 1 Corinthians 9 : 16 - 18 .
Referring next to the ministry given to those in the new covenant , Paul says : “ All of us , . . . with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah . ”
How can humans reflect God’s glory ?
Truths related to the Kingdom constitute part of “ the magnificent things of God ” that began to be proclaimed by those on whom the holy spirit was poured out at Pentecost 33 C.E .
He wrote : “ Since we have this ministry according to the mercy that was shown us , we do not give up ; but we have renounced the underhanded things of which to be ashamed , not walking with cunning , neither adulterating the word of God , but by making the truth manifest recommending ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of God . ”
Regarding the Source of physical and spiritual light , Paul writes : “ God is he who said : ‘ Let the light shine out of darkness , ’ and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ . ”
But as Jehovah’s servants , we catch the glorious light from the Scriptures and reflect it to others .
What did Jesus say about letting our light shine , and what is one way to do this in our ministry ?
Jesus told his followers : “ You are the light of the world .
And the various aspects of our evangelizing work afford us many opportunities to let our light shine .
What suggestions may help us to conduct Bible studies that touch the hearts of truth seekers ?
Jesus delighted in doing his heavenly Father’s will and in talking to others about God .
He was mild - tempered and succeeded in reaching the hearts of those who listened to him .
15 , 16 . ( a ) How might we help a student who does not understand an illustration used in the Bible ?
( b ) What can we do if one of our publications uses an illustration that is difficult for a certain Bible student to understand ?
A Bible student may not be familiar with a particular illustration used in the Scriptures .
A Bible study aid may use an illustration that is hard for a certain student to grasp .
Take time to explain it , or use another illustration that makes the same point .
For instance , the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life quotes many scriptures .
Endeavor to show him how he will benefit from obedience to God . ​ — Isaiah 48 : 17 , 18 .

Although Jehovah has on occasion caused blindness and muteness , he is not responsible for every case of such disabilities .
These are the result of inherited sin .
4 : 16 ​ — How was Moses to “ serve as God ” to Aaron ?
1 : 7 , 14 .
Jehovah is sensitive to the outcry of his people .
Jehovah unfailingly carries out his purposes .
8 : 26 , 27 ​ — Why did Moses say that Israel’s sacrifices would be “ detestable to the Egyptians ” ?
12 : 40 ​ — How long did the Israelites dwell in the land of Egypt ?
If the “ strong east wind ” mentioned at Exodus 14 : 21 had been cold enough to freeze the waters , doubtless some reference would have been made to the extreme cold .
The plagues also show that God can selectively bring calamity upon his enemies while protecting his worshipers .
They had entered the land as free people , not as captives of war to be enslaved .
After due punishment is meted out to the wrongdoers , he again ascends the mountain and receives another set of tablets .
Boiling a kid ( the young of a goat or other animal ) in its mother’s milk reportedly was a pagan ritual thought to produce rain .
This law helped to show God’s people that they should be compassionate .
Likely , this angel was Jesus in his prehuman form .
He was used to guide the Israelites on their way to the Promised Land .
32 : 1 - 8 , 25 - 35 ​ — Why was Aaron not punished for making the golden calf ?
In fact , Jehovah did not personally speak to Moses .
Jehovah provides for his people .
18 : 21 .
The men chosen for responsible positions in the Christian congregation must also be capable , God - fearing , trustworthy , and unselfish .
By means of Moses , Jehovah organized the Israelites into a theocratic nation
A Day to Remember
THE evening before he died , Jesus Christ passed a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of red wine to his apostles and instructed them to eat and to drink .
This year the anniversary of this event falls on Sunday , April 4 , after sundown .
Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of this special meeting .

Bible Names ​ — More Than Just Labels
For example , because Abram would become the father of nations , God changed the patriarch’s name to Abraham , meaning “ Father of a Multitude . ”
The Beast Exposed
For at least two reasons .
Accordingly , human rulership is a product of the Devil , thus reflecting his beastly , dragonlike disposition . ​ — John 8 : 44 ; Ephesians 6 : 12 .
And some leaders have protected fundamental human rights , including the right to engage in true worship ​ — something that Satan does not want .
Still , because of the Devil’s influence , no human or human institution has ever been able to bring lasting peace and security to the people .
* ​ — John 12 : 31 .
The beast’s having “ a human number , ” therefore , indicates that governments reflect the fallen human condition , the mark of sin and imperfection . History bears this out .
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger .
In the Scriptures , certain numbers have symbolic significance .
For instance , God’s creative week comprises seven ‘ days , ’ or extended time periods , during which God completely accomplishes his creative purpose regarding the earth .
Six is one short of seven .
Would it not be a fitting symbol of something imperfect , or defective , in God’s eyes ?
Moreover , six repeated three times , as 666 , powerfully stresses that imperfection .
Likewise , God’s judgment of the political beast and of those with its mark spells the end of that entity and its supporters .
By giving worshipful honor to the political state , its symbols , and its military might , to which they look for hope and salvation .
But that is not all .
[ Footnotes ]
In God’s eyes , the number six , being short of the Biblically complete , or perfect , seven , points to imperfection .

In what ways was Eve deceived ?
( a ) How does Satan mislead people today ?
This spirit powerfully influences the beliefs , attitudes , and behavior of those who do not know God .
How is that spirit manifested , and how can we resist its corrupting influence ?
In modern times , “ the spirit of the world ” has become increasingly manifest .
Those who are led to believe such claims may easily fall prey to the misguided notion that they are free to worship God in any way that they please ​ — or not to worship him at all . ​ — Proverbs 14 : 12 .

Almost imperceptibly , they drift into sin .
And Solomon’s wisdom was vaster than the wisdom of all the Orientals and than all the wisdom of Egypt . ”
How did that happen ?
The Spirit of the World Is Powerful
Solomon’s example teaches us that it is dangerous to reason that because we know the truth , worldly influences will have little impact on our thinking .
It exerts a powerful influence on the thinking and attitudes of the public .
( a ) How does Satan influence people’s thinking ?
How wrong that would be !
To counter the spirit of the world , we must associate with wise people ​ — those who serve Jehovah .
We must fill our mind with things that build up our faith .
As free moral agents , we can choose the things that we consider .
It was to the congregation in Corinth that Paul wrote : “ We received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God . ”
So licentious were most of its inhabitants that the expression “ to Corinthianize ” came to mean “ to practice immorality . ”
Consequently , they understood little or nothing about the true God .
Yet , by means of his holy spirit , Jehovah opened the eyes of some of the Corinthians , enabling them to gain a knowledge of truth .
• What shows that the spirit of the world is powerful ?
• How can we receive and retain the spirit that is from God ?
Truth is relative ​ — people make their own truth .

What changes present a challenge to our spiritual well - being ?
Many such changes are beyond our control , and they can present new and formidable challenges to our spiritual well - being .
Few people undergo such radical changes in their life as did David , the son of Jesse .
David’s Humility ​ — A Fine Example
How did David rise from the obscurity of a shepherd boy to national fame ?
David , the youngest son , was left to tend the sheep .
Soon this shepherd boy would rise to national fame .
Placed over the men of war , David successfully battled the Philistines .
They composed songs lauding him .
What a beautiful lesson for us !
Though David had done no wrong , he fled for his life and took up dwelling in the wilderness .
Why should we not retaliate if we experience opposition or persecution ?
Like David , you may find yourself in trying situations .
His life course of outstanding faithfulness , along with the beautiful psalms that he wrote in praise of Jehovah , might easily give the impression that this was a man who would never fall into serious sin .
Yet , fall he did .
He made inquiries .
Under the Mosaic Law , adultery was a capital crime .
So he sent word to the army , ordering that Uriah return to Jerusalem .
David hoped that Uriah would spend the night with Bath - sheba , but that did not happen .
After Bath - sheba observed the customary period of mourning , David took her to be his wife . ​ — 2 Samuel 11 : 1 - 27 .
Then , at God’s direction , Nathan the prophet went to David .
David rendered swift judgment against the rich man .
What judgment did Jehovah render against David ?
the prophet responded .
David had judged himself .
To David’s credit , he did not deny his guilt .
He did not lash out against the prophet Nathan .
While Jehovah did not shield David from the bitter consequences of his sin , he forgave him .
To Nathan , David expressed his desire to build a temple for Jehovah to contain the ark of the covenant , which was then in Jerusalem “ dwelling in the middle of tent cloths . ”
What preparations did David make for the construction of the temple ?
To Solomon , David said : “ I have prepared for Jehovah’s house a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver , and the copper and the iron there is no means of weighing because they have come to be in such quantity ; and timbers and stones I have prepared , but to them you will make additions . ”
* David’s generous giving was , not an outward show , but a manifestation of faith and devotion to Jehovah God .
David’s generous heart moved him to do all he could to promote pure worship .
Similarly , may we use our material assets to do good .
In what way did David set a fine example for Christians ?
His trust in Jehovah was not in vain .
Yet , he too remained faithful by relying on God’s spirit .
He wrote : “ For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me . ”
And if we continue to rely on God’s spirit , we will be able to ‘ present ourselves approved to God ’ now and throughout eternity . ​ — 2 Timothy 2 : 15 .
David relied on God’s spirit and sought divine approval .

1 , 2 . ( a ) Why should it not surprise us that Jehovah expects his people to show kindness ?
JEHOVAH is a God of kindness .
Being made in God’s image , humans have the capacity to reflect godly attributes .
As Micah 6 : 8 states , God’s people must “ love kindness . ”
But what is kindness ?
Why should we as Christians endeavor to show kindness in our dealings with others ?
What Is Kindness ?
Kindness is displayed by taking an active interest in the welfare of others .
It is shown by helpful acts and considerate words .
He has a generous , considerate attitude toward others .
They are also made new through holy spirit , becoming “ a new creation ” as spirit - begotten sons of God .
Why should those led by God’s spirit show kindness ?
Paul said : “ The fruitage of the spirit is love , joy , peace , long - suffering , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self - control . Against such things there is no law . ”
Some people view kindness as weakness .
In reality , though , it takes real strength to be truly kind and to avoid showing mistaken kindness .
Mistaken kindness , on the other hand , is a weakness that causes one to condone wrongdoing .
Eli’s sons also had immoral intercourse with women serving at the entrance of the tabernacle .
However , instead of ousting Hophni and Phinehas from office , Eli merely rebuked them mildly .
Our Exemplar , Jesus Christ , was never guilty of displaying mistaken kindness .
Think of the kindness and compassion he displayed as “ he took the children into his arms and began blessing them . ”
Though Jesus was kind , he was nevertheless firm for what was right in the sight of his heavenly Father .
Kindness is related to other qualities produced by God’s spirit .
It is listed between “ long - suffering ” and “ goodness . ”
He is patient even with the unkind .
And concerning this love , Paul said : “ Love is long - suffering and kind . ”
Kindness is also linked with love in the word “ loving - kindness , ” often used in the Scriptures .
Jehovah’s loving - kindness , or loyal love , is displayed in various ways .
For instance , it is seen in his acts of deliverance and protection . ​ — Psalm 6 : 4 ; 40 : 11 ; 143 : 12 .
Early in human history , a spirit creature who had become selfish and haughty introduced a plan to become a world ruler .
13 - 15 . ( a ) What were some of the consequences of rejecting Jehovah’s righteous rulership ?
( b ) Why is this world a harsh place ?
Consider some of the consequences .
They went from a lush estate with easy access to healthful vegetation and fruit to the difficult situation outside the garden of Eden .
And thorns and thistles it will grow for you . ” The curse pronounced on the ground meant that cultivating it would now become very hard .
The effects of the cursed ground , with its thorns and thistles , were so keenly felt by Adam’s descendants that Noah’s father , Lamech , spoke of ‘ the pain of their hands resulting from the ground which Jehovah had cursed . ’ ​ — Genesis 3 : 17 - 19 ; 5 : 29 .
God said to Eve : “ I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy ; in birth pangs you will bring forth children , and your craving will be for your husband , and he will dominate you . ”
“ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one , ” declared the apostle John .
Why is God’s rule by means of Christ Jesus marked by kindness , and what does this obligate us to do ?
This can be noted in Jesus ’ words that exposed the false religious leaders , who burdened the people with heavy loads .
You , though , are not to be that way . But let him that is the greatest among you become as the youngest , and the one acting as chief as the one ministering .
19 , 20 . ( a ) How did Jesus convey the extent of Jehovah’s kindness ?
( b ) How can we imitate Jehovah in displaying kindness ?
For even the sinners love those loving them .
And if you do good to those doing good to you , really of what credit is it to you ?
For a genuine Christian , displaying kindness is especially important .
We must , then , love kindness and learn to display it .
• Why is the showing of kindness important for those who desire to live under God’s Kingdom ?
“ The desirable thing in earthling man is his loving - kindness . ” ​ — PROVERBS 19 : 22 .
DO YOU consider yourself to be a kind person ?
Jesus Christ identified Satan as “ the ruler of the world . ”
What challenges can affect our showing kindness ?
Our lives are affected adversely when others treat us in an unkind manner .
The pressure of having contact with people who are rude and who shout and curse at one another often causes much dismay .
A person could easily conclude that showing kindness is hardly a priority and may even be a sign of weakness .
However , the Bible provides proper direction for us when it says : “ An answer , when mild , turns away rage , but a word causing pain makes anger to come up . ”
What are some areas of life in which kindness is needed ?
If so , what are some areas in which we can give evidence that we do not allow the influence of Satan to stifle our kindness , especially in stressful situations ?
To have Jehovah’s blessing and direction , the fruitage of the spirit is vital and needs to be fully cultivated .
Let us focus on the particular need for family members to express kindness to one another .
Every day , Christian families should communicate with one another in a respectful manner .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that the kind thing is usually the right thing to do , a servant of Jehovah should strive to the extent possible to win over those who are not well - disposed .
On other occasions , an employer may force his opinions on his employees and may want everyone to take part in some nationalistic event or in a celebration of an unscriptural nature .
After all , to those who do not share the Christian’s beliefs , what is being done may seem to be the right thing to do .
Kindness at School
A young Christian has to beware that he or she does not imitate those individuals .
The apostle Paul said that “ love is long - suffering and kind ” and that love does “ not brag , does not get puffed up . ”
Hence , a Christian is under obligation , not to follow the poor example of those who act unkindly , but to adhere to Scriptural admonition in his dealings with schoolmates . ​ — 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 .
They think that they are smart when they undermine respect for their teachers by engaging in activities that violate school rules .
When a young Christian refuses to go along , he or she may be targeted for ridicule or abuse .
Be assured that he will support you by means of his spirit in these difficult moments in life . ​ — Psalm 37 : 28 .
At times , you may be able to do your neighbor a favor .
( b ) How can kindness be manifested in various avenues of the field ministry ?
We should remember that we represent Jehovah , who is always kind . ​ — Exodus 34 : 6 .
As an example , while engaged in street witnessing , you can show kindness by being brief and considerate when you approach people .
Also , when you witness in business territory , show your kindness by being brief , remembering that storekeepers have to attend to customers .
Kindness is such an all - embracing quality that it touches every aspect of our lives .
May all of us be kind to others each day and thus individually apply the words of the apostle Paul : “ As God’s chosen ones , holy and loved , clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion , kindness , lowliness of mind , mildness , and long - suffering . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 12 .
• Explain how Christians can display kindness in their public ministry .
“ It was evangelical churchgoers who sometimes questioned the public activism of their clergy , ” said a Christian Century article on political theology .
* Is preaching politics God’s way of achieving better government and a better world ?
It was a “ non - political , quietist , and pacifist community . ”
A History of Christianity says : “ There was a conviction widely held among Christians that none of their number should hold office under the state . . .
Some wanted to be both religious leaders and politicians .
What effect did involvement in politics have on churchmen ?
But historian H .
Luther also encouraged the nobles in their own rebellion against the Catholic emperor .
In fact , Protestants , as Luther’s followers came to be known , formed a political movement from the beginning .
It corrupted him .
What a horrific departure from Jesus ’ teachings !
Did they have a sincere desire to clean up the politics of their day , or was it the prospect of power and of having friends in high places that attracted them ?
In any case , they should have remembered the inspired words of Jesus ’ disciple James : “ Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God ?
Whoever , therefore , wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God . ”
Even so , while recognizing that Christians should be no part of the world’s badness , many object to being politically neutral , truly “ no part of the world . ”

What rich blessing do Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy ?
All who ‘ do the will of God whole - souled ’ contribute to extending it .
What do true Christians have to endure ?
Moreover , we are witnessing the fulfillment of the prophecies dealing with “ the last days . ”
Besides all of that , we are well aware that outside the warm environment of our spiritual paradise , cold winds of opposition blow .
Jesus warned his followers : “ Because you are no part of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , on this account the world hates you .
Bear in mind the word I said to you , A slave is not greater than his master .
Most people still do not understand or appreciate our form of worship .
Where do we look for help to endure ?
Jehovah will help us .
5 , 6 . ( a ) What examples do we have of true worshipers who were able to endure ?
( b ) How did Jeremiah react when called to be a prophet ?
Although Josiah , who was king when Jeremiah started his ministry , was faithful , all succeeding kings were unfaithful , and most of those responsible to instruct the people ​ — the prophets and the priests — ​ were not on the side of truth .
What reaction did Jeremiah meet in his territory , and how did he respond ?
Notice what helped Jeremiah to persevere .
Jeremiah was not alone in his prophetic work .
However , when King Jehoiakim ordered that Urijah be put to death , the prophet fled in fear to Egypt .
He began complaining , saying : “ Woe , now , to me , for Jehovah has added grief to my pain !
I have grown weary because of my sighing , and no resting - place have I found . ”
Still , Jehovah kindly gave Baruch wise counsel , and he was readjusted .
Most important , Jehovah did not abandon Jeremiah .
He understood how his prophet felt and gave him the strength and support he needed .
They will certainly be put to much shame . ” In later years when attempts were made to kill Jeremiah , Jehovah continued with him , and like Baruch , Jeremiah survived the destruction of Jerusalem as a free man , whereas his persecutors and those who ignored his warnings either perished or were dragged off to Babylon .
Jeremiah was in regular communication with Jehovah God , telling him his deepest feelings and begging for strength .
What effect did Jehovah’s words have on Jeremiah ?
Yes , Jeremiah delighted in the fact that God’s name had been called upon him , and His words were precious to the prophet .
How can we implant Jehovah’s words in our heart , and what considerations will make us determined not to keep silent ?
Jeremiah reports something else that helped him to be courageous .
Jeremiah would rather be alone than be corrupted by bad companions .
What will help us to stay spiritually strong ?
Good association , prayer , and good study habits can help us to remain spiritually strong .
19 , 20 . ( a ) What will help us to endure ?
They will not prevail .
But they also have great opportunities .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Picture on page 10 ]
Youths , Are You Building for the Future ?
At school , you may face strong peer pressure .
The question is , How will you use those opportunities ?
What counsel and what warning did Solomon give to youths ?
Why is it wise for young people to prepare for the future ?
( a ) What counsel of Solomon provides guidance for youths ?
That is the key to success ​ — listen to Jehovah and do his will .
Jehovah told the ancient Israelites what he wanted to do for them : “ I myself well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you , . . . thoughts of peace , and not of calamity , to give you a future and a hope . ”
In other words , cultivate the habit of praying .
Have you ever poured out your heart to Jehovah and told him what you think , what you fear , what challenges you face ?
They help us to draw close to Jehovah and to sense that he is drawing close to us .
Yes , if you listen to Jehovah and obey him , you are building for the future .
Also , you “ honor your father and your mother ” by being present at the family Bible study .
It is , he says , “ for one to know wisdom and discipline , to discern the sayings of understanding , to receive the discipline that gives insight , righteousness and judgment and uprightness , to give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness , to a young man knowledge and thinking ability . ”
Make Good Choices
Youth is a time for making choices , some of which have lasting consequences .
Wise choices contribute to a happy , successful life .
If you do so , you will follow Paul’s counsel : “ Quit being fashioned after this system of things , but be transformed by making your mind over , that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . ” ​ — Romans 12 : 2 .
Remember to consult the Bible before making a decision .
We encourage you to read the following scriptures and think about how they can help a young person to be balanced in the matter of choosing a career : Proverbs 30 : 8 , 9 ; Ecclesiastes 7 : 11 , 12 ; Matthew 6 : 33 ; 1 Corinthians 7 : 31 ; 1 Timothy 6 : 9 , 10 .
Do not make the mistake that Baruch , Jeremiah’s scribe , made .
Something similar can be said of us today .
( b ) Why do many not feel spiritually hungry ?
Some feel that modern “ wisdom ” makes Bible teachings out - of - date .
However , “ the world through its wisdom did not get to know God . ”
When you look at those pictures of hungry children , do you ever want to be like them ?
Keep busy at the Kingdom Hall and in the field service .
That is the only way to build for a successful future , a future that will never end .
What Is Your Conclusion ?
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
“ These very ones have become a strengthening aid to me . ” ​ — COLOSSIANS 4 : 11 .
1 , 2 .
Despite the dangers , why did Paul’s friends visit him in prison ?
Paul singles out for mention five Christians who stood by his side : Tychicus , his personal envoy from the district of Asia and a “ fellow slave in the Lord ” ; Onesimus , a “ faithful and beloved brother ” from Colossae ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica and at one time a “ fellow captive ” with Paul ; Mark , the cousin of Paul’s missionary companion Barnabas and the writer of the Gospel bearing his name ; and Justus , one of the apostle’s fellow workers “ for the kingdom of God . ”
It may surprise some to think that Paul , an apostle , needed strengthening .
( b ) What kind of services did Paul’s Christian brothers render to him in Rome , thus proving to be “ a strengthening aid ” ?
Still , in Rome he did find loyal , true companions whose courage and affection soothed his heart .
Further , it takes humility to acknowledge that we may need help in times of personal distress .
Good results can come when those in responsible positions admit that they have limitations and that they are dependent on the support of others .
Such physically or emotionally upsetting conditions test the quality of our faith .
Trialsome situations may arise at work , in school , within the family , or in the congregation .
A serious illness or a past trauma could be the cause .
How the Congregation Can Help
Give an example of one congregation that applied his counsel .
Perhaps those “ depressed souls ” find that their courage is giving out and that they cannot surmount the obstacles facing them without a helping hand .
The expression “ support the weak ” has been rendered “ to hold fast ” or “ to cleave to ” the weak .
Yes , a sincere Christian delights to be a strengthening aid to others .
When Jesus had need of support , Jehovah dispatched angels to strengthen him .
Jehovah wants to be our main Source of strength too .
When life’s trials seem as overwhelming as a “ strong enemy , ” Jehovah can be our strength and our might .
E .
• How is Jehovah our ultimate Source of strength ?

Recalling and applying this scripture helped me to carry out my assignments successfully . ”
Like King David , do you suffer from “ disquieting thoughts ” ?
Elderly Ones ​ — Valuable Members of Our Christian Brotherhood
They will still keep on thriving during gray - headedness . ” ​ — PSALM 92 : 13 , 14 .
How do many people view the elderly ?
( a ) How does Jehovah view his faithful elderly servants ?
Jehovah God treasures his loyal elderly servants .
“ Thriving During Gray - Headedness ”
Another version reads : “ In old age they still produce fruit . ”
( Tanakh ) Do you not agree that this is an encouraging thought ?
* By remaining firmly planted in true worship , you can similarly “ go on bearing fruit in every good work . ” ​ — Colossians 1 : 10 .
Does this apply to you as an older person ?
Moses had already exceeded his “ seventy years ” when Jehovah commissioned him as his prophet and representative .
Some of these have faithfully been producing Kingdom fruitage for decades .
Illustrate how older ones continue producing Kingdom fruitage despite physical limitations .
Not long ago , Sonia and her sister , Olive , shared the Bible’s message of hope with Janet , a terminally ill patient whom they met in a hospital waiting room .
How did aging Caleb demonstrate his trust in Jehovah , and how can elderly Christians imitate his example ?
Caleb was 79 years old when he crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land .
“ Fat and Fresh They Will Continue to Be ”
( See box on page 13 . )
Calling attention to the fruitfulness of elderly servants of Jehovah , the psalmist sang : “ The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does ; as a cedar in Lebanon does , he will grow big .
The secret of the palm tree’s perennial beauty lies in an unfailing source of fresh water .
What could elderly Jehoiada do ?
For six years he and his wife hid the only surviving royal heir , Jehoash , in the temple .
At Jehoiada’s orders , the people tore down the house of the false god Baal and removed its altars , images , and priest .
When he died at the age of 130 , Jehoiada was given the exceptional honor of burial with the kings because “ he had done good in Israel and with the true God and His house . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 24 : 15 , 16 .
Your ready acceptance of the Bible’s counsel and your loyal support for “ the faithful and discreet slave ” and the congregation will have a strengthening effect on the Christian brotherhood .
You can also incite fellow worshipers “ to love and fine works . ”
“ Tell That Jehovah Is Upright ”
How do elderly Christians “ tell that Jehovah is upright ” ?
The palm tree bears silent witness to its Creator’s superlative qualities .
But Jehovah has given you the privilege of testifying about him to those now embracing true worship .
He said : “ Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . They have all come true for you . ”
How has Jehovah dealt with his people in modern times ?
Yet , our faith in Jehovah and his promises is reinforced when we hear firsthand accounts of the “ great work ” that he has performed for his people in these last days .
Over time , you have seen Jehovah remove certain obstacles and ‘ speed up ’ Kingdom growth .
( a ) Illustrate the long - term effect of ‘ telling others that Jehovah is upright . ’ ( b ) How have you personally experienced Jehovah’s uprightness ?
What about the occasions when you have experienced Jehovah’s loving care and guidance in your personal life ?
Tolmina has given the same advice to many of her own Bible students over the years .
( b ) What will be considered in the next article ?
What has helped longtime Christians to remain healthy in faith and to maintain their spiritual vigor ?
What we have is due to God’s undeserved kindness .
1 , 2 .
Even when young people reach adulthood and have their own families , their fathers and mothers continue to give them loving attention and support .
How can we imitate Jehovah’s loving concern for the elderly ?
( a ) What indicates that Joseph had not forgotten his filial duties ?
For more than 20 years , Joseph had no contact with his elderly father , the patriarch Jacob .
Do not delay . And you must dwell in the land of Goshen , and you must continue near me . . .
And I will supply you with food there . ”
Yes , honoring aged parents includes protecting them and providing for them materially when they are not in a position to care for themselves .
Why did Jacob wish to be buried in Canaan ?
Joseph honored his father by complying with this request , despite the considerable cost and effort involved . ​ — Genesis 47 : 29 - 31 ; 50 : 7 - 14 .
( a ) What is our chief motivation in caring for elderly parents ?
( b ) What did one full - time servant do in order to care for his aging parents ?
( See box on page 17 . )
Indeed , love for Jehovah and reverential fear of him will move us to care for aging parents , no matter what challenges doing so may involve .
How Elders Show That They Care
Who has Jehovah appointed to shepherd the flock , including elderly Christians ?
Shortly after the inception of the Christian congregation , the apostles appointed “ seven certified men . . . full of spirit and wisdom ” to supervise “ the daily distribution ” of food among needy Christian widows .
Likewise , congregation overseers today willingly coordinate practical assistance for elderly Christians when this is necessary .
Regardless of the poor widow’s age , Jesus did not overlook what she did .
How can elders show their appreciation for the contribution made by elderly Christians ?
Like Jesus , Christian overseers do not overlook what the elderly do to promote true worship .
Elders in another congregation report that a 71 - year - old pioneer sister has been successful in helping Kingdom publishers to become regular in field service .
Elders also value the contribution of older fellow overseers .
José , who is in his 70 ’ s and has served as an elder for decades , recently underwent extensive surgery .
“ The reaction of the other elders surprised me , ” says José .
It is not only children with aged parents and appointed servants who should be concerned about the elderly .
If hearing is a problem , we may need to speak slowly and enunciate clearly .
What if certain older ones cannot attend Christian meetings ?
James 1 : 27 shows that it is our duty “ to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation . ”
And how the elderly appreciate our visits !
In effect , they may be saying , ‘ Please , do your best to visit me soon . ’
For the vast majority of Jehovah’s servants , that will be life eternal on a paradise earth , where the effects of inherited sin will be eliminated and faithful elderly ones will enjoy the restoration of their youthful vigor .

“ It was not easy going back , ” recalls Philip , “ but I felt that my first obligation was to my parents . ”
Over the next three years , he moved his parents to a more suitable home and with the help of local fellow Christians adapted the dwelling to accommodate his father’s special needs .

Now organized into a new nation , they are on their way to the land of Canaan .
However , the regulations found in Leviticus can benefit us , teaching us much about the worship of our God , Jehovah .
( Leviticus 1 : 1 – 7 : 38 )
The voluntary communion sacrifice was shared .
One part of it was presented to God on the altar , another portion was eaten by the priest , and still another by the offerer .
Sin offerings and guilt offerings were compulsory .
The second satisfied God when a right was violated , or it restored certain rights for the repentant wrongdoer ​ — or both .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
2 : 11 , 12 ​ — Why was honey “ as an offering made by fire ” unacceptable to Jehovah ?
Since it could ferment , it was unacceptable as an offering upon the altar .
This was not done to enhance the flavor of the sacrifices .
Since the fat was regarded as the best or the richest part , the prohibition against eating it evidently impressed upon the Israelites that the best part belonged to Jehovah .
7 : 26 , 27 .
In God’s view , blood represents life .
“ The soul [ life ] of the flesh is in the blood , ” states Leviticus 17 : 11 .
HOLY PRIESTHOOD IS SET FORTH
This demonstrated that Jehovah accepted blood for atonement purposes .
“ Nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law , ” wrote the apostle Paul , “ and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place . ” ​ — Hebrews 9 : 22 .
10 : 1 , 2 .
HOLY WORSHIP DEMANDS CLEANNESS
Food regulations concerning clean and unclean animals benefited the Israelites in two ways .
The required purification regulations would help the Israelites to appreciate the need for a ransom sacrifice to cover mankind’s sinfulness and restore human perfection .
He is considerate of the poor .
A goat was sacrificed for Israel’s nonpriestly tribes .
The two goats were regarded as one sin offering .
There are also regulations about offerings in connection with vows and valuations , the firstborn of animals , and the giving of every tenth part as “ something holy to Jehovah . ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
This law was evidently given to prevent the Jews from trimming their beards or hair in a way that would imitate certain pagan practices .
25 : 35 - 37 ​ — Was it always wrong for the Israelites to charge interest ?
Jehovah’s name is not to be reproached .

That sentiment is shared by many who feel that although religious affiliation is important , it does not really matter which religion one chooses to follow .
Is it logical to believe that it is immaterial to Almighty God how we worship him ?
Paul admonished : “ I exhort you , brothers , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement , and that there should not be divisions among you , but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 1 : 10 .
Can such unity be found ?
As we have seen , God has long dealt with his people as a group .
The psalmist David once asked : “ O Jehovah , who will be a guest in your tent ?
What a blessing when true friends , spiritual brothers and sisters , lovingly assist one another to fulfill their responsibilities before God !
He explains : “ Whenever I attended church , I came out feeling as empty as when I went in . ”
Still , he retained his faith in God .
An Invitation to Those Seeking
How could such a task be satisfactorily accomplished if there were no direction or organization ?
How could one obey this Scriptural injunction if he tried to serve God independently ?
You are invited to learn of the divine requirements as set forth in the Bible .
You need to base your choice of religion on accurate Bible knowledge , not on unproved dogmas or hearsay .
Compare them with your own beliefs .
( b ) How do the 24 elders give glory to God ?
Why “ Inexcusable ”
Unfortunately I believe it to be illusory . . . .
Why is disbelief in God inexcusable ?
The Universe Declares God’s Glory
It is as if speech praising God were ‘ bubbling forth ’ from the heavens .
However , it takes discernment to hear this witness .
“ There is no speech , and there are no words ; no voice on their part is being heard . ”
Yet , the silent testimony of the heavens is powerful .
Clearly , it was not exhausted from its “ journey ” from east to west but was like “ a mighty man , ” ready to repeat the journey .
For years , astronomers observed what was described as “ small luminous regions with a nebulous , not resolved appearance . ”
Scientists presumed that these “ spiral nebulae ” were objects in our Milky Way galaxy .
Jehovah asked Job : “ Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation , or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation ? ”
By way of contrast , some Greek philosophers felt that light emanated from the human eye .
Today , scientists believe that light behaves both as a wave and as a particle .
Still , the nature of light and how it “ distributes itself ” is far from fully understood .
Psalm 148 enumerates other ways in which creation declares God’s glory .
The blue whale has an average weight of 120 tons ​ — as much as 30 elephants !
Its heart alone weighs over 1,000 pounds [ 450 kg ] and is able to pump some 14,000 pounds [ 6,400 kg ] of blood through its body !
Hardly .
Its heartbeat slows down during the dive , and blood is diverted to the heart , lungs , and brain .
Elephant seals and sperm whales can dive to even greater depths .
They store most of the oxygen they need in their muscles .
Even seawater reflects Jehovah’s wisdom .
This “ invisible forest ” cleans our air by drawing out billions of tons of carbon dioxide .
In decades past , forest fires were viewed only as destructive .
Researchers now believe that fire plays an important ecological role , eliminating old or dying trees , promoting the germination of many seeds , recycling nutrients , and actually reducing the risk of wildfire .
Thousands of tiny “ valves ” ( called stomata ) on a leaf’s underside open and close , letting in carbon dioxide .
The plant can now feed on the very food it has created .

Blessed Are Those Who Give Glory to God
Why are we able to bring God glory in ways that surpass what inanimate creation can do ?
While his inanimate creation silently brings him glory , we humans have the ability to reason , to comprehend , to appreciate , and to worship .
For you are great and are doing wondrous things ; you are God , you alone . ”
It is not that God literally demands nonstop praise from his servants , but his worshipers are a global organization .
So when it is nighttime in some lands , God’s servants on the other side of the globe are busy witnessing .
Others are plagued with feelings of low self - worth .
We are also exposed to Satan’s direct attack .
Give In or Fight Back ?
Like the ancient tribe of Gad , we must be spiritually strong and fight back in accord with God’s directions .
It is , therefore , easy to view God’s worship as another pressure , a burdensome obligation .
Are we not already “ loaded down ” ?
We do not have to do it in our own strength . ​ — Matthew 9 : 36 ; 11 : 28 , 29 , footnote ; 2 Corinthians 4 : 7 .
When we take on the yoke of discipleship , we are fighting against Satan .
Sharing in the field ministry allows us to enjoy upbuilding association with fellow worshipers .
Illustrate .
However , time spent as a family in the field ministry does not have to be drudgery .
I took the children to meetings and in the door - to - door ministry on a regular basis .
All five children are baptized . ”
In class I always raise my hand and tell what I have learned from the Bible .
When you are convinced that what you have learned is the truth , you will never be “ ashamed of the good news . ” ​ — Romans 1 : 16 .
Might your circumstances permit you to enter a door to activity ?
“ When you pioneer , you use the Bible so much .
Now when I go from door to door , I can think of scriptures that are appropriate for each householder . ”
Could you consider entering the door to pioneering ?
“ I didn’t feel capable .
“ It was fun working with her , ” Kenyatte recalls .
With some encouragement and training , perhaps you too will want to pioneer .
What blessings may come to those who enter missionary service ?
Pioneering may open the door to other privileges of service .
But the blessings make such inconveniences pale into insignificance .
What blessings has she enjoyed ?
Here , I have had up to four students at a time starting out in field service ! ”
Some brothers have enjoyed the blessing of international service , working on branch construction in foreign lands .
What other organization would put forth so much effort to give training ? ”
Despite her limitations , she is whole - souled in her service . ​ — Matthew 22 : 37 .
The book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
As the Gadites fought against marauding bands , Christians must fight against Satan’s attacks
Pioneering may open the door to other privileges of service , including :
International service
Missionary service
In line with Proverbs 23 : 22 , it is right to “ listen ” to God obediently , desirous of grasping and acting on his view of life rather than preferring any other assessment of life .
Show Respect for Life
Do you think that Cain had a right to make such a decision about life ?
God did not think so .
In a declaration applying to all humans , God revealed more about his evaluation of life and blood .
He said that humans could eat animal flesh , but he set this restriction : “ Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you .
But time would clearly show that what God was here prohibiting was the consuming of blood to sustain life .
God continued : “ Your blood of your souls shall I ask back .
The Creator gives the person life , and no one should take that life , represented by blood .
If , like Cain , someone does commit murder , the Creator has the right to “ ask back ” the murderer’s life .
What is that teaching , and how are your life , decisions , and actions involved ?
There were also animal sacrifices .
The earth is God’s footstool , and by pouring the blood on the earth , the person acknowledged that the life was being returned to the Life - Giver . ​ — Leviticus 17 : 11 - 13 ; Isaiah 66 : 1 .
What was the sole use of blood outlined in the Law , and what was the purpose of this ?
“ I myself have put [ blood ] upon the altar for you to make atonement for your souls . ”
It was to play a vital role in covering sins ( atonement ) .
They reminded the Israelites that they were sinful and needed something more in order to gain complete forgiveness .
The Life - Giver’s Solution
Similarly , Paul wrote : “ The Law has a shadow of the good things to come , but not the very substance of the things . ” ​ — Hebrews 10 : 1 .
Yes , he chose to view blood as standing for life and said : “ I myself have put [ blood ] upon the altar for you to make atonement for your souls . ”
You know that Jesus was tortured and impaled .
He died like a criminal .
God recommends his own love to us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”
Some churches emphasize Jesus ’ death , their adherents saying such things as “ Jesus died for me . ”
So , what is lacking in these renderings ? ’
The rendering “ the blood of that one ” is rich in meaning and should convey much to our mind .
Then the high priest took some of their blood into the Most Holy compartment of the tabernacle or temple , there presenting it before God , as if in his presence . ​ — Exodus 25 : 22 ; Leviticus 16 : 2 - 19 .
How did Jesus fulfill what was foreshadowed by the Atonement Day ?
It should in ours too .
And how grateful we should be to Jesus for his sacrificially pouring out his blood for us !
The following article will address this question .
But now in union with Christ Jesus you who were once far off have come to be near by the blood of the Christ . ” ​ — Ephesians 2 : 12 , 13 .
Through the blood of Jesus , many lives could be saved
“ Turn . . . to the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them . ” ​ — ACTS 14 : 15 .
AFTER the apostle Paul and Barnabas healed a man , Paul assured observers in Lystra : “ We also are humans having the same infirmities as you do , and are declaring the good news to you , for you to turn from these vain things to the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them . ” ​ — Acts 14 : 15 .
He is interested in our enjoying life , present and future .
4 , 5 . ( a ) Before the Christian era , what guidance about blood did Jehovah give ?
Yes , God’s guidance was with our life and well - being in mind .
Would non - Jews who wanted to benefit from Christ’s blood have to be circumcised , showing that they were still under the Law ?
Plainly , the governing body viewed ‘ abstaining from blood ’ to be as morally vital as abstaining from sexual immorality or idol worship .
How is the Christian to respond ?
He has firmly resolved never to accept a blood transfusion , but his physician urges him to accept one major component , maybe packed red cells .
* That article quoted from Genesis , Leviticus , and Acts .
Since 1981 , many fractions ( breakdown elements derived from one of the four major components ) have been isolated for use .
Accordingly , The Watchtower of June 15 , 2000 , provided helpful information on the subject in the article “ Questions From Readers . ”
Christians agree on the need to follow God’s guidance , yet in some areas personal judgments must be made , and conscience comes into play .
Was it necessary to hang the sheep by its hind legs ?
Why might Christians have differing views about accepting an injection of a small fraction from a blood component ?
What the Bible says about conscience is helpful when we make such decisions .
As to taking in blood fractions , some have thought , ‘ This is a matter of conscience , so it doesn’t make any difference . ’
The fact that something is a matter of conscience does not mean that it is inconsequential .
A related aspect underscores the seriousness of decisions concerning blood .
Paul aptly wrote : “ You had no hope and were without God in the world .

Still , some Christians may have felt that they would not go into the temple or go through such a procedure .

“ All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth .
( a ) How extensive is Jesus ’ authority ?
Therefore , we respectfully and willingly obey Christ’s command to ‘ go and make disciples . ’
Early in his earthly ministry , Jesus taught his disciples in a striking way that recognizing his authority and obeying his commands would lead to blessings .
He once told Peter , who was a fisherman : “ Pull out to where it is deep , and you men let down your nets for a catch . ”
However , Peter humbly added : “ But at your bidding I will lower the nets . ”
Just as obeying Jesus ’ command to let their nets down led to overwhelming results , so obeying Jesus ’ command to ‘ catch men ’ would lead to great blessings .
In full faith , the apostles responded .
Today , as we encourage others to share in the work of making disciples , we imitate Jesus .
Consider the following observations made by several faithful Witnesses from different lands , and note how the cited scriptures support their comments .
I want to keep my word . ”
Imagine !
When Peter said , “ Depart from me , because I am a sinful man , ” Jesus did not depart , nor did he condemn Peter for any sin .
Rather , Jesus kindly answered : “ Stop being afraid . ”
Jesus told his followers : “ Make disciples of people of all the nations . ”
Prior to the time of Jesus ’ ministry , people of the nations were welcomed if they came to Israel to serve Jehovah .
What expansion of ‘ the fishing grounds ’ has taken place since the early 20th century ?
At the beginning of the 20th century , the ‘ fishing grounds ’ were confined to a few lands .
Making disciples in all nations is a challenge not only geographically but also linguistically .
Does the modern - day history of God’s people illustrate that aspect of discipleship ?
( b ) How has the faithful slave class responded to the growing need for spiritual food in different languages ?
( Include the box “ Publications for the Blind . ” )
For instance , in 1950 our literature was published in 90 languages , but today that number has risen to some 400 .
An average of some 5,000 people ‘ out of all tongues ’ become disciples of Christ each week of the year !
Consider two examples from the Netherlands , where organized Kingdom - preaching is carried out in 34 languages .
A Witness couple volunteered to go and make disciples among Polish - speaking immigrants .
The response to their efforts was so overwhelming that the husband felt compelled to reduce his secular employment so as to have one more day a week available to study the Bible with those showing interest .
Before long , the couple were conducting over 20 Bible studies each week .
A couple from Britain said : “ The ministry in the foreign - language field is one of the most exciting we have experienced during our 40 years of Kingdom service . ”
Varying Our Methods
Experienced disciple - makers have been giving increased attention to witnessing in a variety of places .
A goodly number of newly baptized Witnesses in Hawaii were first contacted at such locations .
• To what extent have Jehovah’s servants today carried out Jesus ’ commission to make disciples of people of all nations ?
[ Box / Pictures on page 10 ]
He is blind .
Using Bible literature in Braille helps him to be more effective in his ministry , including his activities as service overseer .
“ We have never had a more effective service overseer in our congregation than Albert , ” says James , the presiding overseer .
In fact , from 1912 onward , the faithful slave class has provided more than one hundred different publications in Braille .
Do you know someone who may benefit from Bible publications prepared for the blind ?
Worldwide , there are over 1,200 sign - language congregations and groups .
Making Disciples of Business People
Another Witness in Hawaii studies the Bible once a week with the owner of a shoe - repair shop .
The study is held right at the shop counter .
THE man from Ethiopia had journeyed all the way to Jerusalem .
Evidently , he also loved God’s inspired Word .
The reply of the Ethiopian is noteworthy .
In its own way , this comment illustrates the importance of a specific instruction that Jesus included in his commission to make disciples .
To find the answer , let us continue our consideration of Jesus ’ words found in Matthew chapter 28 .
( a ) How does someone become a disciple of Jesus Christ ?
Rather , he said : ‘ Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you . ’
What does that imply ?
However , to teach his students how to obey those rules , he has to guide the students as they actually drive in traffic and struggle to put into practice what they have learned .
In that way , we imitate the example set by Jesus and by Jehovah himself . ​ — Psalm 48 : 14 ; Revelation 7 : 17 .
He added : “ We tend to proclaim our message from a distance .
We are afraid of getting wet . ”
Similarly , a new disciple who travels on the road to life learns not only from his teacher but also from the fine examples that he sees in the congregation . ​ — Matthew 7 : 13 , 14 .
The student may observe a couple who are making drastic adjustments in their life in order to serve as caregivers to their elderly parents .
In years past , we have gladly given of our time , energy , and resources to find those who are “ rightly disposed for everlasting life . ”
That is also our heartfelt desire .
Shortly after his resurrection , Jesus told some of his followers : “ Have no fear ! Go , report to my brothers , that they may go off into Galilee ; and there they will see me . ”
Although the apostles had shown serious weaknesses , Jesus still called them “ my brothers . ”
We truly miss their companionship .
In the case of the apostles , the invitation bore fruit , for “ the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them . ”
What joy we feel when weaker ones similarly respond to our warm invitations and resume attending Christian meetings ! ​ — Luke 15 : 6 .
How will we react when a weaker Christian arrives at the Kingdom Hall ?
“ Jesus approached and spoke to them . ”
May we too take the initiative and warmly welcome spiritually weak ones who make the effort to return to the Christian congregation .
He did not rebuke the disciples for their failures and doubts .
Before long , the apostles were once again “ teaching and declaring the good news . ”
Jesus , our Leader , who has ‘ all authority in heaven and on earth , ’ is with us to support us !
Jesus ’ promise “ I am with you all the days ” is also a source of great comfort .
He also told us what we should teach and until when we should do so .
Do you not agree ?
Rather , “ teaching is a continuous process , which partly precedes baptism . . . and partly follows baptism . ”
Further information on how to view and help weaker ones is found in The Watchtower of February 1 , 2003 , pages 15 - 18 .
How Would You Answer ?
“ Happy is the man . . . [ whose ] delight is in the law of Jehovah . ” ​ — PSALM 1 : 1 , 2 .
True , we face many trials .
And our heavenly Father certainly gives us good gifts .
The Secret of Happiness
According to Psalm 1 : 1 , what are some reasons why a godly person is happy ?
We can be happy if we pursue a similar course and firmly refuse to ‘ walk in the counsel of the wicked ’ or to be guided by their ungodly advice .
If we reject the thinking of wicked ones , we will not be ‘ standing in the way of sinners . ’
In fact , we could then go from bad to worse .
In time , we might even become faithless apostate ridiculers .
“ Do not be anxious over anything , ” wrote Paul , “ but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God ; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus . ”
The apostle encouraged consideration of things that are true , of serious concern , righteous , chaste , lovable , well spoken of , virtuous , and praiseworthy .
What will help to make a lasting impression on our mind and heart during periods of personal study ?
Our eternal happiness depends on our taking delight in God’s law .
It is perfect and righteous , and there is a great reward in keeping it .
If we truly delight in Jehovah’s law , not a day will pass without our giving consideration to spiritual matters .
13 - 15 .
With God’s help , however , we are able to endure these tests successfully , just as a healthy tree withstands comparatively strong winds .
A tree planted by an unfailing water source does not dry up in hot weather or during a drought .
He is comparing two things that are different , though they share a particular quality .
As we pursue an upright course , Jehovah helps us to bear the pressure of trials and difficulties .
‘ Everything we do succeeds ’ because our main objective is to do Jehovah’s will .
Since his purposes always succeed and we delight in his commandments , we prosper spiritually .
The Wicked Seem to Prosper
The wicked are not “ rich toward God . ”
Hence , they have no more security and stability than does chaff , the thin covering on kernels of grain .
But the chaff was gone .
Surely , though , we are happy that such evildoers will soon be gone forever .
Indeed , obedient humans will eventually receive God’s gift of everlasting life . ​ — Matthew 25 : 34 - 46 ; Romans 6 : 23 .
“ The way of righteous ones ” will remain forever , but incorrigibly wicked people will perish because of Jehovah’s adverse judgment .
But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth , and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace .
[ Picture on page 12 ]
The nations also have a purpose .
God’s purpose is certain to be fulfilled , for he goes on to say : “ Just as the pouring rain descends , and the snow , from the heavens and does not return to that place , unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout , and seed is actually given to the sower and bread to the eater , so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be .
It will not return to me without results , but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted , and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it . ” ​ — Isaiah 55 : 9 - 11 .
Its composer , King David of ancient Israel , was divinely inspired to foretell that there would be a notable time when the nations would be in tumult .
Ask of me , that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession . ’ ” ​ — Psalm 2 : 7 , 8 .
Indeed , what do these developments mean for all God - fearing readers of the second psalm ?
*
What “ empty thing ” have the present - day national groups “ kept muttering ” ?
Instead of accepting God’s Anointed One ​ — the Messiah , or Christ — ​ the nations have “ kept muttering , ” or meditating on , the perpetuation of their own authority .
These words of the second psalm also had an application in the first century C.E . when Jewish and Roman authorities worked together to kill God’s King - Designate , Jesus Christ .
It is their purpose that is empty ; it is futile and doomed to failure .
In fact , they have unitedly taken a belligerent stand and massed themselves together against the Most High and his Anointed One .
Persecuted for their faith , they prayed : “ Sovereign Lord [ Jehovah ] , you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them , and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David , your servant , ‘ Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things ?
Jehovah Holds Them in Derision
He laughs at their futile opposition .
But you yourself , O Jehovah , will laugh at them ; you will hold all the nations in derision . ”
Psalm 2 : 6 applies to what enthronement ?
God declares : “ I , even I , have installed my king upon Zion , my holy mountain . ”
Christ referred to the Kingdom covenant when he told his apostles : “ You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials ; and I make a covenant with you , just as my Father has made a covenant with me , for a kingdom . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 28 , 29 .
As foretold at Psalm 2 : 7 , Jehovah acknowledged Jesus as His Son at his baptism and by resurrecting him to spirit life .
According to this psalm , God tells his Son : “ Ask of me , that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession . ” ​ — Psalm 2 : 8 .
The scepters of kings of ancient times were symbols of royal authority .
They should consider the emptiness of their plans , in contrast with what God’s Kingdom will do for the benefit of mankind .
20 , 21 .
Those refusing to recognize the authority of God’s chosen King insult Jehovah .
“ His anger flares up easily , ” or blazes quickly and irresistibly .
Doing so means life .
There is still time for individuals to do what ?
This dramatic psalm concludes : “ Happy are all those taking refuge in him [ Jehovah ] . ”
How can we live a more satisfying life even in this troubled world ?
Surely , then , it is high time to “ kiss the Son ” and serve the Sovereign Lord , Jehovah !
Initially , King David was the “ anointed one , ” and “ the kings of earth ” were Philistine rulers who massed their armies against him .
See also Psalm 2 : 9 and Revelation 2 : 27 .
[ Picture on page 17 ]
King David of ancient Israel prophetically spoke of this world situation .
According to Bible chronology and fulfilled prophecies , in the year 1914 , God’s Kingdom was established in the heavens with Jesus Christ as King .
* At that time the nations of the world had one thought in common .
How does Jehovah God view such a reaction on the part of human rulers ?
How so ?
In that final battle , God’s Kingdom “ will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [ of the world ] , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ”
That is the Kingdom for which many sincere people have prayed , saying : “ Let your kingdom come . Let your will take place , as in heaven , also upon earth . ”
First of all , it has a powerful and efficient executive branch headed by the enthroned King , Jesus Christ .
A relief work was organized , and Barnabas and Saul were dispatched from Antioch with a relief ministration . ​ — Acts 11 : 27 - 30 .
Whenever disasters ​ — earthquakes , famines , floods , hurricanes , storms , or volcanic eruptions — ​ strike , the Christian congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses responds quickly to the needs of fellow believers and others in the affected areas .
For instance , when devastating earthquakes hit El Salvador in January and February 2001 , relief activities were organized in all parts of the country , and groups of Jehovah’s Witnesses from Canada , Guatemala , and the United States provided help .
Ever since its establishment in 1914 , God’s heavenly Kingdom has been gathering and organizing its subjects from peoples around the world .
At international conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses , observers are often astounded to see the love , peace , and unity among the vast crowds of people , transcending barriers of nationality , culture , and language .
Every government has standards that its citizens are expected to meet , and everyone who wants to live under that government must meet those standards .
It also helps people to respond to the admonition : “ Quit being fashioned after this system of things , but be transformed by making your mind over , that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses happily and energetically share “ this good news of the kingdom ” with their neighbors , inviting them to become its subjects .
Does such a prospect appeal to you ?

( b ) What evidence is there that Stephen was humble ?
Although well - versed in the Scriptures , he was more than happy to be given an assignment to “ distribute food to tables ” so that the apostles could devote themselves “ to prayer and to the ministry of the word . ”
What outstanding demonstration of God’s undeserved kindness did Stephen experience ?
When Stephen was witnessing to the hostile crowd of Jewish leaders in the Sanhedrin , his opposers “ saw that his face was as an angel’s face . ”
After giving a bold witness to members of the Sanhedrin , Stephen experienced an outstanding demonstration of God’s undeserved kindness .
It is , therefore , vital that we understand what true humility is , how we can cultivate this important quality , and how we benefit by displaying it in all aspects of life .
5 , 6 . ( a ) What is humility ?
( b ) How has Jehovah displayed humility ?
( c ) How should we be affected by Jehovah’s humility ?
David , in turn , knew that any greatness or glory that he might achieve as king depended on Jehovah’s humbly acting in his behalf .
( b ) In what way does Jehovah , as well as Manasseh , set an example for us to follow in showing humility ?
Finally , Jehovah punished Manasseh by allowing him to be taken off his throne by the king of Assyria .
As the Holy Scriptures testify , Jehovah is humble , yet he displays righteous indignation and awesome power when the occasion calls for them .
In his own due time and through his chosen channel of communication , Jehovah has revealed to humble ones details regarding the outworking of his purpose .
In the first century , how did some show a lack of humility , and how did this prove detrimental to them ?
In the first century , many , including some who claimed to be Christians , showed a lack of humility and were stumbled by what the apostle Paul revealed to them about God’s purpose .
Their lack of humility hindered them from gaining knowledge and understanding of the glorious way Jehovah works out his purpose .
Why must we work at maintaining humility , and how is this highlighted in the case of King Saul of Israel ?
Saul , the first one anointed as king of Israel , did just that .
This was the beginning of a chain of events that unmistakably betrayed his lack of humility .
The result was the loss of God’s spirit and favor , which eventually led to his ignominious death .
The lesson is clear : We must work at maintaining humility and submissiveness and stifle feelings of self - importance , thus avoiding any presumptuous acts that result in Jehovah’s disfavor .
Although humility is not listed as a part of the fruitage of God’s spirit , it is a godly quality that must be cultivated .
Humans are like mere grasshoppers in a field .
What helped the prophet Daniel to cultivate humility , and what can help us do the same ?
Additionally , Daniel was a diligent and rightly motivated student of God’s Word , which helped him to keep God’s glorious purpose in focus .
And he was truly interested in promoting God’s righteousness , not his own .
Can we learn from Daniel’s outstanding example and endeavor to cultivate and demonstrate humility in all aspects of our life ?
• In what ways has Jehovah God displayed humility ?
F .
While Brother Rutherford was a man of strong convictions , known for speaking out forcefully and without compromise for what he believed to be the truth , he was also genuinely humble before God , often reflecting that in his prayers at morning worship in Bethel .
Stephen , well - versed in the Scriptures , humbly distributed food
Manasseh’s humble state of mind pleased Jehovah
Cultivating a Christlike View of Greatness
“ Whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister . ” ​ — MATTHEW 20 : 26 .
What is the world’s view of greatness ?
To serve or to be served ​ — which appeals to you more ?
Haman’s craving for glory led to his humiliation and death .
His warped idea of greatness was expressed in these words : “ Is not this Babylon the Great , that I myself have built for the royal house with the strength of my might and for the dignity of my majesty ? ”
Who is behind the world’s prideful spirit ?
It is proper for us to want to use our life in a way that brings us honor and respect .
* The worldly concept of greatness , whether it is in the field of business , sports , or entertainment , does not ensure lasting satisfaction .
Greatness From Service Motivated by Love
On the way , two of Jesus ’ cousins , James and John , manifested a wrong view of greatness .
Ask yourself : ‘ How would I have reacted if I were James or John ?
His love moved him to help people spiritually , traveling hundreds of miles over dusty roads to preach the good news of the Kingdom .
Without a doubt , Jesus took serving others seriously .
What was looked for , according to Zion’s Watch Tower of September 1 , 1894 , were men “ of meekness ​ — that they might not be puffed up . . . , of humble mind who seek not to preach themselves , but Christ ​ — not to air their own knowledge , but his Word in its simplicity and power . ”
Clearly , true Christians should never seek responsibility in order to satisfy personal ambition or to gain prominence , power , and control over others .
He might enjoy the association of responsible men in the congregation yet be reluctant to share in the preaching work .
Such a young man would do well to ask himself : ‘ Do I focus primarily on aspects of God’s service that bring recognition and praise ?
“ I could not believe it ! ”
That brother , now an overseer at one of the branch offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses , still remembers that act of humility .
It is part of “ the new personality ” that a Christian must put on . ​ — Philippians 2 : 3 ; Colossians 3 : 10 , 12 ; Romans 12 : 16 .
How can meditating on our relationship with God and with our fellowman help us to cultivate the proper view of greatness ?
Meditating on our relationship with our fellowman also helps us to cultivate lowliness of mind .
How does the integrity of God’s people show that no one has a basis for feeling superior to others ?
Do they see you perform lowly tasks ?
One brother , who now serves at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses , vividly recalls his parents ’ example .
This attitude has helped me to accept willingly any work assignment here at Bethel . ”
Each of us needs to probe his own heart and ask : ‘ Will I pay only lip service to cultivating Christ’s view of greatness , or will I work diligently to put it into practice ? ’
May our actions show that we delight in manifesting the Christlike view of greatness , whether it is in the Christian congregation , in our family life , or in our day - to - day dealings with fellow humans ​ — doing all things to God’s glory and praise . ​ — 1 Corinthians 10 : 31 .
For examples , see the 1992 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses , pages 181 - 2 , and The Watchtower of September 1 , 1993 , pages 27 - 31 .

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
FOLLOWING their Exodus from Egypt , the Israelites were organized into a nation .
Shortly thereafter , they could have entered the Promised Land , but they did not .
It should impress upon us the need to obey Jehovah God and respect his representatives .
Its name is derived from the two censuses of the Israelites , taken some 38 years apart .
The first part relates events that happened at Mount Sinai .
The assembly is also given instructions about setting up and breaking camp .
2 : 1 , 2 ​ — What were “ the signs ” around which the three - tribe divisions were to encamp in the wilderness ?
8 : 25 , 26 .
If because of advanced age a Christian cannot fulfill certain obligations , he may engage in a form of service that is within his power to perform .
When the cloud above the tabernacle eventually rises , the Israelites begin a march that will bring them to the desert plains of Moab 38 years and one or two months later .
Miriam and Aaron’s complaint against Moses results in Miriam being temporarily stricken with leprosy .
Believing the bad report of ten of the spies , the people want to stone Moses , Aaron , and the faithful spies Joshua and Caleb .
As a result , 14,700 die in a scourge from Jehovah .
To make his selection of high priest known , God causes Aaron’s rod to bud .
The use of red - cow ashes prefigures the cleansing through Jesus ’ sacrifice . ​ — Hebrews 9 : 13 , 14 .
Lack of water .
Because Moses and Aaron fail to sanctify Jehovah’s name when miraculously providing water , they lose out on entering the Promised Land .
While going around Edom , the Israelites tire out and speak against God and Moses .
12 : 1 ​ — Why did Miriam and Aaron complain against Moses ?
21 : 14 , 15 ​ — What was the book mentioned here ?
“ The book of the Wars of Jehovah ” was such a writing .
It contained a historical account of the wars of Jehovah’s people .
Moses provides an excellent example regarding how we should respond when others receive privileges in Jehovah’s service .
Jehovah expects his worshipers to show respect for God - given authority .
The unique fringe of the Israelites ’ dress was intended to remind them that they were a people set apart to worship God and to obey his commandments .
( Numbers 22 : 1 – 36 : 13 )
As a result , Jehovah destroys 24,000 wrongdoers .
The second census reveals that none of the men counted in the first are still alive , except for Joshua and Caleb .
The people of Israel also take vengeance upon the Midianites .
Reuben , Gad , and the half tribe of Manasseh settle east of the Jordan River .
Levites are assigned 48 cities , and 6 of these are to serve as cities of refuge .
Jehovah had told the prophet Balaam that he should not curse the Israelites .
A husband does not have the authority to set aside or cancel such a vow .
A wife , though , should avoid making a vow that conflicts with God’s Word or her duties toward her husband .
Should not the desire to keep the congregation clean move us to report any knowledge of gross immorality to Christian elders ?
35 : 9 - 29 .
How appropriate that Jehovah will destroy the wicked before the earth is transformed into a paradise ! ​ — Proverbs 2 : 21 , 22 ; Daniel 2 : 44 .
We must show respect for Jehovah and for those appointed to positions of responsibility among his people .
The incidents related in Numbers show how easily those who neglect their spirituality can fall into wrongdoing , such as murmuring , immorality , and idolatry .
Some of the examples and lessons from this Bible book can serve as a basis for local needs parts on the Service Meeting at congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ Our son , Anderson , died when he was 14 .
But he died before they could be sold .
when he asks if we carried out his heart’s desire .

Hated Without Cause
( See footnote . )
They are peaceful and calm , and they love one another very much . ”
Servants of God find no pleasure in being maligned as evildoers , yet they are not surprised when people speak against them .
Jesus forewarned his followers : “ If the world hates you , you know that it has hated me before it hated you . . . .
* Earlier he had told his disciples : “ If people have called the householder Beelzebub , how much more will they call those of his household so ? ”
How does the Bible reveal the source of all unjustified hatred ?
( b ) How does an understanding of this issue help us to maintain our integrity ?
What is one tactic the Devil uses to try to turn us away from Jehovah ?
The descriptive name Devil , meaning “ Slanderer , ” identifies that one as the foremost slanderer of God , his good word , and his holy name .
This distressed Jesus , for he knew that it reflected unjustly on his Father .
Some problems may be the result of our own imperfections .
Under what circumstances might this occur ?
Try to picture in your mind those who have upheld Jehovah’s sovereignty in the face of every indignity that the Devil could hurl against them ​ — such men and women as Abel , Job , Jesus ’ mother Mary , and other faithful ones of old , as well as our fellow servants in modern times .
What can help us to avoid becoming bitter when we suffer ?
Remember that our principal adversaries are Satan and the demons .
In addition , we can draw a lesson from the example of Jacob’s son Joseph .
16 , 17 .
Christ Jesus , the Fine Shepherd , said : “ My sheep listen to my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
Therefore , nothing that opposers say or do can thwart God’s purpose . ​ — Isaiah 54 : 17 ; Acts 5 : 38 , 39 .
This aroused Grace’s curiosity .
The next time the Witnesses called , instead of hiding she engaged them in conversation and received her personal copy of the publication .
[ Footnote ]
“ Hate ” may also signify a strong dislike but without any intent of bringing harm to the object , seeking instead to avoid it because of a feeling of loathing toward it .
• How does Jehovah strengthen us to stand firm in the face of satanic hatred ?
They Discerned the Real Issue
One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine , where the Kingdom - preaching work was under ban for over 50 years , observed : “ The situation in which Jehovah’s Witnesses found themselves should not be evaluated merely in the context of human relations . . . .
Most of the officials were merely doing their job .
“ We did not view ourselves simply as the innocent victims of oppressive men .
Job , Mary , and God’s servants in modern times , such as Stanley Jones , have upheld Jehovah’s sovereignty
He has the power to protect his faithful worshipers in any manner he wishes .
Rather , it is his will that we live among the general population of this world in order to proclaim his message of hope and comfort to others .
Even faithful worshipers of Jehovah must face what reality , but what comfort do we find in God’s Word ?
He is our “ fortress in the time of distress . ”
Second , we should work in harmony with his holy spirit .
And third , we must submit to Jehovah’s arrangement by seeking association with fellow Christians who can allay our distress .
Some health experts recommend prayer as treatment for depression and stress .
Yes , prayer is part of our worship .
What does it mean to pray with confidence , and how do such prayers help us to cope with distress ?
The apostle John wrote : “ This is the confidence that we have toward him , that , no matter what it is that we ask according to his will , he hears us . ”
On such occasions we do well to remember that Jehovah “ shows pity upon his own afflicted ones ” and that he “ comforts those laid low . ”
Jehovah listens to our prayers when they are offered with a complete heart .
Yes , God’s active force acts as a helper , or comforter , to his people . ​ — John 14 : 16 .
Likewise , many Christians today have felt a renewal of spiritual and emotional strength in answer to their supplications .

The Bible tells us that bad things will not continue to happen indefinitely .
If we rejoice in that hope , with a constant awareness of the bright future that Jehovah promises , we can endure under tribulation . ​ — Romans 12 : 12 ; 1 Thessalonians 1 : 3 .
The Bible says : “ A true companion is loving all the time , and is a brother that is born for when there is distress . ”
Having such a frame of mind can help us to focus on the needs of others rather than on our own trials .
How can each Christian be encouraging ?
In order to do so , they make themselves approachable and available .
Paul appropriately urges Christians to “ speak consolingly to the depressed souls . ”
The apostle Paul wrote : “ There should be no division in the body , but . . . its members should . . . care for one another .
At times , we may feel too downhearted to enjoy association with fellow Christians .
The Bible warns us : “ One isolating himself will seek his own selfish longing ; against all practical wisdom he will break forth . ”
For instance , when experiencing adversity , some may begin to question their own spirituality , concluding that their hardship is a sign of God’s disapproval .
He cares for us , and he will exalt us in due time .
Why ?
As Jesus warned us , in the world we will have tribulation .
• How is God’s spirit a helper ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
Yet , some of Jehovah’s worshipers undergo bouts of emotional tiredness .
Not long before his arrest and execution , Jesus told his disciples : “ Do not let your hearts be troubled .
Exercise faith in God , exercise faith also in me . ”
If left unchecked , feelings of sadness could prove spiritually debilitating and cause them to lose their trust in Jehovah .
Granted , being a Christian requires vigorous exertion .
Jesus even stated : “ Whoever is not carrying his torture stake and coming after me cannot be my disciple . ”
On the surface these words may appear to contradict Jesus ’ statement about his load being light and refreshing , but in reality there is no contradiction .
Vigorous exertion and hard work , although physically tiring , can be satisfying and refreshing when it is done for a good cause .
“ Put Off Every Weight ”
What is often the cause of spiritual tiredness ?
For instance , the world’s preoccupation with prominence , money , entertainment , travel for pleasure , and other material pursuits can influence our thinking .
Some first - century Christians who pursued riches severely complicated their lives .
“ The wisdom from above is . . . reasonable , ” says the Bible .
True , the good example of fellow Christians can encourage us to serve Jehovah wholeheartedly , but practical wisdom and reasonableness will help us to set realistic goals according to our own circumstances .
How can we manifest practical wisdom in caring for our physical and emotional needs ?
The wife says : “ No matter how much work we have , we try to go to bed about the same time every night .
We also exercise regularly .
This has really helped us .
She has had serious health problems , including cancer .
Practical wisdom and thinking ability help us recognize and satisfy our individual needs and thus avoid spiritual tiredness .
16 , 17 . ( a ) Why is caring for our spiritual health highly important ?
When we have an intimate relationship with Jehovah God , we may get physically tired , but never will we tire of worshiping him .
She says : “ I have made it a practice to rise early so that before starting any work , I can spend time in prayer to Jehovah and read his Word .
What comfort does the Bible provide for faithful ones who are advanced in age or who are ill ?
Similarly , regular spiritual activities can help relieve any feelings of emotional or spiritual exhaustion .
These imply action on our part .
To fight off feelings of discouragement and tiredness , we do well to avoid the company of those who dwell on negative thoughts and are prone to find fault and criticize others .
There we have an excellent opportunity to encourage one another with refreshing instruction and association .
Worshiping Jehovah in this time of the end involves work .
Our imperfect human nature is fragile , like clayware .
Yet , the Bible says : “ We have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves . ”
A Brief Review
[ Picture on page 24 ]
And even though conventional wisdom cautions that money does not ensure happiness , 47 percent of those questioned were convinced that it does .
First , look at the supposed link between money and happiness .
Furthermore , while many in the United States have almost doubled their material possessions in the past three decades , they are not any happier than they used to be , according to mental - health experts .
Next , how important for happiness are such factors as good health , a satisfying marriage , and a successful career ?
Are We Searching in the Right Places ?
This is not surprising because man’s Creator is described as “ the happy God , ” and man was made in God’s image .
Social philosopher Eric Hoffer thought so .
“ With one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . ” ​ — ROMANS 15 : 6 .
Yet , all Christians must walk arm in arm on the road to life .
Is that possible ?
And how can we apply his inspired counsel today ?
Nevertheless , after establishing many congregations and visiting others over a period of more than 20 years , he knew that maintaining unity could be a challenge .
Today , we likewise must glorify Jehovah God “ with one mouth ” as a united group of his people .
Since Christians today come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures , studying Paul’s inspired counsel on how to handle differences can help them to speak “ with one mouth . ”
5 , 6 .
Why were there differences in viewpoint in the Rome congregation ?
However , that Law was no longer binding after Jesus died .
Even after becoming Christians , they may have set the seventh day aside exclusively for spiritual purposes , even though from God’s standpoint the Sabbath was no longer in force .
Hence , out of consideration for the conscience of his Christian brothers , Paul wrote : “ Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind . ” ​ — Romans 14 : 5b .
What should Christians refrain from doing ?
When she accepts the truth , she may find it hard to adjust to the idea that it is not forbidden to wear modest , colorful clothing on appropriate occasions or to make tasteful use of makeup .
He accepts that view .
When might a Christian , for the benefit of his brothers , refrain from exercising his rights ?
In that case , what should we do ?
Paul says : “ It is well not to eat flesh or to drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles . ”
When the conscience of a fellow Christian could be offended by what we do , brotherly love will move us to be considerate and restrict our choices .
An example of this might be the use of alcoholic beverages .
Do we continue driving at the maximum speed allowed just because we have the legal right to do so ?
( b ) In what do we all act in complete unison , and what will be discussed in the following article ?
Truly , displaying an accommodating and generous disposition toward Christians having a weaker conscience ​ — or voluntarily restricting our choices and not insisting upon our rights — ​ demonstrates “ the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had . ” ​ — Romans 15 : 1 - 5 .
Such unity is evident , for instance , in our reaction to those who oppose true worship .
• Why would having different views on personal matters be no threat to unity ?
Paul’s counsel on unity was vital for the congregation
It is Mary Magdalene .
This account illustrates in a touching way what Jesus stated some time earlier .
However , according to that same illustration , a sheep’s ability to recognize human voices enables it to know not only its friend but also its foe .
How can we protect ourselves ?
To find out , let us see what else Jesus says in his illustration of the sheepfold .
According to the illustration of the shepherd , whom do the sheep follow , and whom do they not follow ?
Why do we not extend hospitality to the type of stranger mentioned in John chapter 10 ?
He “ does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs up some other place . ”
Who is the first individual mentioned in God’s Word who became a thief and a plunderer ?
Satan the Devil .
Nevertheless , his actions show that in many ways he was like the stranger described in Jesus ’ illustration recorded in John chapter 10 .
Consider some similarities .
He added : “ God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened . ”
Why should we expect the voice of strangers to be heard today ?
What is one way in which the voice of strangers is being heard ?
As the apostle Peter puts it , they use “ counterfeit words ” ​ — words that resemble truth but that are actually as worthless as counterfeit money . ​ — 2 Peter 2 : 3 .
Beware of such strangers !
He convinced her that Jehovah had unduly restricted her freedom , when in reality the opposite was true .
They kept saying that my religion was restrictive and unreasonable . ”
In chat rooms , perverse adults may even pose as youths to lure you into a trap .
How do the media , at times , publish the voice of strangers ?
In another one , a report accused Witnesses of vandalizing churches .
In several countries the media accused Witnesses of refusing to give medical treatment to their children and also of deliberately condoning serious sins committed by fellow believers .
Even so , sincere people who know us personally recognize that such accusations are false .
It is unwise to believe everything presented as truth in the media .
A book on Bible lands relates that a visitor once claimed that sheep recognize their shepherd by his dress , not his voice .
A shepherd answered that it was the voice they knew .
Yet , when the shepherd called them , though he was disguised , the sheep came at once .
Thus , someone may look like a shepherd , but for sheep , that does not prove that he really is one .
( a ) How do we become familiar with the voice of Jehovah ?
The Bible points out how we develop such knowledge .
Walk in it , you people . ’ ”
( b ) According to Matthew 17 : 5 , why should we obey Jesus ’ voice ?
Besides hearing , it involves obeying .
God’s Word declares : “ This is the way . ”
Yes , through a study of the Bible , we hear Jehovah’s directions .
Yes , we resolutely reject a stranger .
Do You Remember ?
• How does Satan fit the description of the stranger mentioned in Jesus ’ illustration about the sheepfold ?
Mary recognized Christ
This great crowd refers to those who will survive the coming “ great tribulation , ” which will destroy the present wicked world . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 14 .
Various Bible scholars , past and present , reached the same conclusion ​ — that is , the number is literal .
For instance , in commenting on Revelation 7 : 4 , 9 , British lexicographer Dr . Ethelbert W .
( The Apocalypse or “ The Day of the Lord , ” page 282 ) More recently , Robert L .
Thomas , Jr . , professor of New Testament at The Master’s Seminary in the United States , wrote : “ The case for symbolism is exegetically weak . ”
That conclusion , though , is clearly not correct .
It refers to those who will rule in heaven with Christ over a paradise earth , which will be filled with a large and undetermined number of happy people who worship Jehovah God . ​ — Psalm 37 : 29 .
The number of heavenly heirs is limited to 144,000
“ Go On Acquiring Power in the Lord ”
“ Go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength . ” ​ — EPHESIANS 6 : 10 .
SOME 3,000 years ago , two combatants faced each other between two opposing armies on the field of battle .
Before him stood Goliath , a man of unusual strength and stature .
David proved victorious because he fought in Jehovah’s strength .
Christians do not engage in physical warfare .
In the final chapter of his letter to the Ephesians , Paul described a fight in which every Christian is involved .
Indeed , Paul urges us to “ go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength . ”
What two main points will we consider in this article ?
Let us now analyze what the Scriptures say about the strengths and tactics of our enemy .
The principal wicked spirit is , of course , Satan the Devil , “ the ruler of the demons . ”
The Bible portrays our fight as “ a wrestling , ” or a hand - to - hand struggle .
Likewise , the Devil wants us to lose our spiritual balance .
How can he make us do this ?
He can use human agents to persecute or discourage us .
Since Satan has the whole world at his disposal , he can exploit its desires and attractions in order to ensnare us .
What limitations do the demons have , and what advantages do we enjoy ?
What was true in the time of Elisha is true in our day : “ There are more who are with us than those who are with them . ”
What trials did Satan bring upon Job to break his integrity , and what spiritual dangers do we face today ?
Although Satan may not directly cause these problems today , such hardships do affect many Christians , and the Devil can use them to his advantage .
10 - 12 . ( a ) What was one warning Jesus gave in his illustration of the sower ?
Finally , the host dies .
In a similar way , the anxieties of this system and the quest for riches and a comfortable life - style can gradually absorb more and more of our time and energy .
What stand do we need to take when opposed by Satan ?
Until Satan is removed , however , we have to “ stand firm ” so that his attacks do not overwhelm us .
According to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words , “ a verbal form of the word signifies medicines which allay irritation . ”
Family problems , economic hardship , or illness can sap our spiritual strength .
Like Job , we did not always understand why things happened as they did , but we did know that Jehovah was always there to help us . ”
The psalmist David sang : “ Jehovah is giving support to all who are falling , and is raising up all who are bowed down . ”
We Need “ the Complete Suit of Armor From God ”
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
However , it was by divine inspiration that the apostle was moved to discuss the spiritual armor vitally needed by every servant of Jehovah .
[ Picture on page 14 ]
“ Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil . ” ​ — EPHESIANS 6 : 11 .
In your own words , describe the spiritual armor Christians need to put on .
ROME was at the height of its power during the first century C.E .
One historian described this army as “ the most successful military organization in history . ”
Jesus gives us instructions for our spiritual warfare and provides a perfect example of how to wear spiritual armor .
Protecting the Loins , the Breast , and the Feet
Jesus had God’s law ‘ within his inward parts . ’
When questioned by opposers , he could therefore respond by quoting the Scriptures from memory . ​ — Matthew 19 : 3 - 6 ; 22 : 23 - 32 .
Why did a Roman soldier need good footwear , and what does it illustrate ?
Jesus preached whenever he found a hearing ear , and he enjoyed his ministry so much that he gave it priority over his physical needs .
The Shield , the Helmet , and the Sword
In Bible times , soldiers used darts made out of hollow reeds having small iron receptacles that could be filled with burning naphtha .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What “ burning missiles ” of Satan could undermine our faith ?
( b ) How does Jesus ’ example show the importance of faith during times of trial ?
A desire to possess more and more material things and the lure of immorality have also proved spiritually devastating in the case of some .
The Devil tried in vain to sidetrack Jesus by offering him “ all the kingdoms of the world and their glory . ”
But Jesus flatly rejected the offer , and Paul said of him : “ For the joy that was set before him [ Jesus ] endured a torture stake , despising shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . ” ​ — Hebrews 12 : 2 .
If we fill our mind with the dreams and goals of this system of things instead of keeping in mind the hope ahead , our faith in God’s promises will get weaker .
In time , we could even lose our hope completely .
( b ) Illustrate how the sword of the spirit can help us resist temptation .
God’s word , or message , recorded in the Bible is like a powerful two - edged sword that can cut down religious falsehood and help righthearted people find spiritual freedom .
When he was 19 years old , an attractive young woman who worked in the same cleaning company suggested that they “ have a good time together . ”
“ He rejected immorality and immediately got out of the way .
Moreover , we must ‘ do our utmost to present ourselves approved to God , as workmen with nothing to be ashamed of , handling the word of the truth aright . ’
17 , 18 . ( a ) What role does prayer play in resisting Satan ?
( b ) Give an example to illustrate the value of prayer .
Milagros , who has cared for her chronically ill husband for over 15 years , says : “ When I feel discouraged , I turn to Jehovah in prayer .
Nobody can help me more than he can .
We have to resist this powerful enemy and “ fight the fine fight of the faith . ”
Clearly , it is essential that we put on the complete suit of armor that Jehovah supplies .
How Would You Answer ?
• Who provides the best example of wearing spiritual armor , and why should we consider his example carefully ?
[ Pictures on page 19 ]
Having spent these years in the wilderness , the Israelites are still a nation without a land .
What awaits them as they take possession of it ?
Before Israel crosses the Jordan River into the land of Canaan , Moses prepares the congregation for the great task ahead .
And the counsel given in them is just what we need today , for we too live in a world in which giving Jehovah our exclusive devotion is a challenge . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Think of the impact this warning example must have had on Moses ’ listeners as that land lay before their very eyes .
How fitting that Moses gives a stern warning against idol worship !
Jehovah commanded Israel not to engage in strife with the sons of Esau .
Because they were the offspring of Jacob’s brother .
The Israelites were not to molest or war against the Moabites and the Ammonites , for they were descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot .
Hence , when Sihon refused to let the Israelites pass through and Og came to meet them in battle , Jehovah commanded the Israelites to demolish their cities , leaving no survivors .
4 : 15 - 20 , 23 , 24 ​ — Does the prohibition against making carved images mean that it is wrong to make representations of objects for artistic purposes ?
What a price to pay for disobeying Jehovah God ! ​ — Numbers 14 : 26 - 34 .
( Deuteronomy 5 : 1 – 26 : 19 )
The sons of Israel are reminded of an important lesson they learned in the wilderness : “ Not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live . ”
As they settle in the land of promise , the Israelites will need laws not only regarding worship but also respecting judgment , government , war , and everyday social and private life .
This was a miraculous provision , as was the regular supply of manna .
In the Bible , the term “ alien resident ” could refer to a non - Israelite who became a proselyte or to a settler who lived by basic laws of the land but who did not become a worshiper of Jehovah .
Seizing either of these would deprive the entire family of its daily supply of bread .
According to “ the custom of former times in Israel concerning the right of repurchase . . . , a man had to draw his sandal off and give it to his fellow . ”
6 : 6 - 9 .
We must not allow anyone to draw us away from the worship of Jehovah .
Our hope in the resurrection makes such an extreme expression of mourning for the dead inappropriate .
In his third speech , Moses states that after crossing the Jordan , the Israelites must write the Law on great stones and also pronounce cursings for disobedience and blessings for obedience .
Moses again warns against disobedience and exhorts the people to “ choose life . ” ​ — Deuteronomy 30 : 19 .

Moses ’ discourses make up the main part of Deuteronomy
What lesson is taught by Jehovah’s provision of manna ?
So , then , what did God originally purpose for mankind , and how will it all work out ?
“ This is what Jehovah has said , the Creator of the heavens , He the true God , the Former of the earth and the Maker of it , He the One who firmly established it , who did not create it simply for nothing , who formed it even to be inhabited : ‘ I am Jehovah , and there is no one else . ’ ”
God’s purpose regarding the earth is also made evident in the commission that he gave to the first human pair .
For Adam and Eve to continue living in the garden of Eden , they must obey that simple and clearly stated command .
Did the first couple’s disobedience thwart God’s purpose in creating the earth ?
A God Who Has Not Changed
Through his prophet Malachi , God declared : “ I am Jehovah ; I have not changed . ”
How , though , can we be sure that Jehovah has not changed his original purpose with regard to the earth ?
Under his rule , “ Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security , everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree , from Dan to Beer - sheba , all the days of Solomon . ”
At that time , “ there will come to be plenty of grain on the earth ; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow . ” ​ — Luke 11 : 31 ; Psalm 72 : 7 , 16 .
At Revelation 21 : 4 , God’s Word tells us that in the promised new world , God “ will wipe out every tear from [ people’s ] eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ”
Who will be in line to enjoy that wonderful inheritance ?
Dictionaries generally define “ meek , ” or “ mild , ” as gentle , moderate , submissive , quiet , even timid .
He is also teachable , willing to be taught by Jehovah .
The peace and security of Solomon’s reign provided a preview of the promised inheritance

A Letter From Alejandra
While there , she came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses and enjoyed having Bible discussions with them .
Soon , Diojany was getting discouraged because she had not been able to find the Witnesses to resume her Bible discussions .
Your God has heard your prayers . ”
It was a letter from Alejandra .
Diojany got in touch with Alejandra’s mother and sister , Blanca , and accepted a Bible study .
Alejandra encouraged her to continue to apply herself in her Bible study so that she could make spiritual progress .
But what favorable and lasting effects it can have !
Curious , he examined the burs under a microscope and was intrigued by the tiny hooks that latched onto anything that had a loop .
True , Jehovah is the most glorious Personage in the universe , but that does not mean that he is glorious in the eyes of all humans .
In the Bible , the Hebrew word rendered “ glory ” has the basic sense of “ heaviness . ”
Few today take note of what makes God impressive .
How do many scientists explain away the wonders of creation ?
Have scientists come to their conclusions because facts and evidence point that way ?
The sheer number of stars fills us with awe .
How is Jehovah’s wisdom evident in the animal creation ?
The earth is full of your productions . ”
Jehovah’s “ productions , ” including the animal creation , bespeak his wisdom .
What wisdom indeed !
Predestination is an unscriptural teaching that slanders God .
It confuses what he can do with what he actually does .
The fact that God can foreknow events is clearly stated in the Bible .
However , it is illogical to think that he cannot control his ability to know the future or that he is responsible for every outcome .
To illustrate : Suppose you had great physical strength .
Likewise , having the ability to know the future does not compel God to foreknow or foreordain everything .
His use of foreknowledge is selective and discretionary .
A second way that organized religion dishonors God is through the conduct of its adherents .
( a ) What is the clergy’s record when it comes to the wars of the nations ?
To answer the question of who are truly giving glory to God , why must we look to the Bible ?
Let us consider three ways to glorify God , in each case addressing the question of who today are truly doing so .
First , we can glorify God by praising his name .
A few days before he died , Jesus prayed : “ Father , glorify your name . ”
Who today , then , are glorifying Jehovah by making his name known and praising it throughout the earth ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses are , and they are doing so in 235 lands ! ​ — Psalm 86 : 11 , 12 .
Why should we consider whether we personally are giving glory to Jehovah ?
According to Psalm 148 , most of creation gives glory to God .
How sad that most humans today do not !
As you exercise faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice , you become reconciled to God and enjoy a peaceful and fruitful relationship with your heavenly Father .
• Why can we say that the scientific community in general has not helped people to glorify God ?
• Why should you consider whether you personally are giving glory to Jehovah ?
“ What disturbed me during those war years . . . was seeing clergymen of practically all denominations ​ — Catholic , Lutheran , Episcopal , and so forth — ​ blessing the aircraft and their crews before they took off on missions to drop their deadly cargo .
As he now lay fighting his final illness , some of his former students traveled thousands of miles to his bedside to say , “ Kamsahamnida , kamsahamnida ! ” ​ — “ Thank you , thank you ! ” in Korean .
Later , when Paul told his Ephesian brothers that they would not see him again , “ weeping broke out among them all , and they fell upon Paul’s neck and tenderly kissed him . ”
Thus , The New Testament in Modern English , by J .
At these conventions , local Witnesses meet brothers from faraway lands , and many have opened their homes to foreign delegates .
Showing hospitality to our brothers , regardless of their background , can bring out the best in both guest and host . ​ — Romans 12 : 13 .
Mark , who served as a missionary in East Africa , said , “ Working shoulder to shoulder with our brothers forges a bond that is unbreakable . ”
What is required for us to enjoy Christian affection in the congregation ?
You are not cramped for room within us . ”
Can you too “ widen out ” in your affections ?
“ All ages are present , as well as single parents , ” he relates . “ Everyone carries home happy memories , and they feel closer to one another . ”
Ric , a traveling minister in East Africa , recalls a brother whose abrasive personality made him hard to get along with .
This need not ​ — and should not — ​ be the case in the Christian congregation .
When we look out for one another’s interests in this way , we promote tender affection , and we will experience the truth of Jesus ’ words : “ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ” ​ — Acts 20 : 35 ; Philippians 2 : 1 - 4 .
Thoughtful acts also promote tender affection .
What can we do if someone seems not to respond to our affection ?
So if someone does not seem to warm up to you as you would like , do not quickly conclude that there is something wrong with you or with that person .
This expression of acceptance must have deepened Jesus ’ conviction that his Father had affection for him .
Sadly , some never hear such commendation from those they respect and love .
Why is displaying a critical attitude toward others not helpful ?
Such thinking can even affect Christian families and the congregation .
Or in some other way , they may even suggest displeasure with a younger one .
He invites us to draw close to him .
( b ) What is required to enjoy intimacy with Jehovah ?
An intimate friendship with Jehovah is the most important relationship we can cultivate .
Their warm expressions have been preserved to give us confidence that we too can draw close to Jehovah . ​ — Psalms 23 , 34 , 139 ; John 16 : 27 ; Romans 15 : 4 .
Jehovah’s requirements for intimacy with him are within the reach of everyone .
“ O Jehovah , who will be a guest in your tent ? ” asked David .
Love among Christians reflects more than just duty
[ Pictures on page 16 , 17 ]
Are you critical or encouraging ?
Paradise ​ — For You ?
Or what of the prophecy of the wolf with the lamb and the kid with the leopard ?
You have reason to believe the Bible’s promises about that Paradise .
For example , you have confidence in Jesus ’ words to the impaled evildoer : “ You will be with me in Paradise . ”
The term “ spiritual paradise ” may seem abstract , hard to grasp , but such a paradise was foretold , and it really does exist .
Yes , I know such a man ​ — whether in the body or apart from the body , I do not know , God knows — ​ that he was caught away into paradise and heard unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to speak . ”
Moreover , the Bible does not speak of any other person who had such an experience , and Paul is the one who tells us of it .
In this supernatural experience , what “ paradise ” did he enter ? ​ — 2 Corinthians 11 : 5 , 23 - 31 .
Earlier Bible prophecies offer us insight .
How do we know that Isaiah chapter 35 focused on people ?
He knew that after his death an extensive apostasy would develop .
Yet , the time would come for true worship to be elevated again .
10 , 11 .
Granted , we know that individually we are imperfect , so it does not surprise us that problems occasionally arise , even as they did among Christians in Paul’s day .
Compared with the sick condition that we once were in , we have been healed spiritually .
Rather than struggling as in an arid spiritual land , God’s people have his approval and a downpour of blessings .
Does not that refreshing spiritual food give evidence of our spiritual paradise ?
Think , too , of the changes in traits as sincere ones of all backgrounds have striven to understand and apply God’s Word .
Basically , they have worked to put away animalistic traits that used to characterize them .
Still , there is something that we must not overlook .
They are striving to be kind and helpful .
Consider another foregleam of Paradise .
After Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years , Moses led them to the Plains of Moab , east of the Jordan River .
Moses implored God : “ Let me pass over , please , and see the good land that is across the Jordan . ”
However , there is reason to believe that overall the region was quite different in Biblical times .
How must Isaiah 35 : 2 have given exiled Israelites an idea of what the Promised Land would be like ?
Isaiah foretold : “ Without fail it will blossom , and it will really be joyful with joyousness and with glad crying out . The glory of Lebanon itself must be given to it , the splendor of Carmel and of Sharon .
There will be those who will see the glory of Jehovah , the splendor of our God . ”
19 , 20 . ( a ) Describe the area of ancient Sharon . ( b ) What is one way to strengthen our hope for Paradise ?
Being well watered , it was fine for grazing , but it had forests of oak trees in the northern sections .
Would you like to get a better grasp of where these were and what their relationship was with other geographic references ?

Moses realized that it was a “ good land ”
“ Go about in the land through its length and through its breadth . ” ​ — Genesis 13 : 17 .
Others prefer to travel by bicycle to get exercise and to have a more leisurely view .
Lot chose the “ District of the Jordan , ” a lush valley “ like the garden of Jehovah , ” and in time resided in Sodom .
Likely from an elevated location by Bethel , Abraham could see other parts of the land .
God invited him to “ go about in the land ” and get familiar with its nature and regions .
Still , we have reason to be keenly interested in knowing about Bible locations .
God’s Word comments : “ The heart of the understanding one acquires knowledge , and the ear of wise ones seeks to find knowledge . ”
This is true of facts about places mentioned in the Bible .
Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron , Sodom , and Nineveh as well as Canaan , Moab , Ammon , and Assyria are all mentioned in that one chapter .
Knowing the distance involved makes Samson’s feat take on new dimensions , does it not ?
9 , 10 . ( a ) What was included in Gideon’s victory over the Midianites ?
Still , enough are identified , so that we can follow Gideon’s actions .
Gideon chased the remnant of the coalition forces past Beth - shittah and then southward to Abel - meholah , near the Jordan .
The account says : “ Gideon came to the Jordan , crossing it , he and the three hundred men that were with him , tired but keeping up the pursuit . ”
That was some 50 miles [ 80 km ] of pursuit and fighting .
Take as an example the Israelites who moved from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land .
From there Moses sent 12 spies into the Promised Land .
Because they accepted the negative report of ten spies , the Israelites had to wander in the wilderness for 40 years .
13 , 14 . ( a ) In what situation did the Gibeonites take a decisive step ?
That included the Gibeonites .
How did Christians in Beroea show appreciation for Paul ?
They would have had much to think and speak about on their trip back to Ephesus .
What can we be determined to do as to Bible locations ?
As we add to our knowledge and understanding of the Promised Land in particular , we can bear in mind a fundamental requirement for the Israelites to enter and enjoy the land of “ milk and honey . ”
By doing so , we will contribute toward enhancing and beautifying the spiritual paradise that now exists in the worldwide Christian congregation .

Three days later , Mr . Chamberlain left office , and Winston Churchill took his place .
Little wonder that good leaders have proved very hard to find .
( See the box “ Suddenly out of Power , ” on page 5 . ) Still , competent and enduring leadership has proved elusive .
More often , it is a cry for help from those who feel that no one is listening . ”
There never is .

An election campaign worker put it this way : “ When people cast a vote for president , they are casting a vote for someone in whom they are entrusting their lives , their future , their children . ”
Our world is beset with problems that defy solution .
Who among today’s leaders has the resources and compassion to provide every human with food , clean water , and health care ?
Humans Cannot Do the Job
Yet he will take control over all my hard work at which I worked hard and at which I showed wisdom under the sun .
Solomon did not know whether his successor would continue his good work or tear it all down .
To Solomon , the cycle of replacing old rulers with new ones was “ vanity . ”
One version says : “ It doesn’t make sense . ”
Capable leaders have been cut down as they were doing their work .
Despite all he did and his desire to do more for the people , President Lincoln led his country for only four years .
Fatigue and hunger did not discourage him .
Jesus was willing to work .
His own feet got dirty as he preached the good news along the dusty roads of Israel .
He thus set an example of diligence for all Christians . ​ — 1 John 2 : 6 .
Of the resurrected Jesus , the Bible says : “ Christ , now that he has been raised up from the dead , dies no more ; death is master over him no more . ”
What This New Leader Will Do
And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth . ”
Those men who today attack others like voracious lions or who act like ill - tempered bears toward their neighbors will have changed their dispositions completely .
From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul , and their blood will be precious in his eyes . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses will gladly help you to do so .
A ruler can usually count on the respect and support of his subjects if he brings them a reasonable measure of peace and secure living conditions .
These conditions contributed to the French Revolution , which in 1793 sent King Louis XVI to the guillotine .
For example , in 1917 a war - induced food shortage in St .
Jesus fed the hungry , healed the sick , and set a fine example for all Christians
Such happiness reflects a close relationship with our heavenly Father and the knowledge that we are doing his will .
On what occasion did Jesus speak about happiness , and what was his opening statement ?
It is called the Sermon on the Mount because Jesus gave it on a mountainside overlooking the Sea of Galilee .
The Gospel of Matthew relates : “ When [ Jesus ] saw the crowds he went up into the mountain ; and after he sat down his disciples came to him ; and he opened his mouth and began teaching them , saying : ‘ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need , since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them . ’ ”
For the “ other sheep , ” it means everlasting life on a paradise earth under that Kingdom government . ​ — John 10 : 16 ; Psalm 37 : 11 ; Matthew 25 : 34 , 46 .
( a ) What is meant by the expression “ those who mourn ” ?
( b ) How are such mourning ones comforted ?
He said : “ Happy are those who mourn , since they will be comforted . ”

They can thus have a precious relationship with Jehovah and entertain the hope of living forever to serve and praise him .
This brings them deep inner happiness . ​ — Romans 4 : 7 , 8 .
What is not meant by the term “ mild - tempered ” ?
It is a strength under control . ”
Indeed , mildness and self - control were listed together by the apostle Paul when he outlined “ the fruitage of the spirit . ”
Mildness of temper must be cultivated with the help of the holy spirit .
( b ) How do the mild - tempered ones “ inherit the earth ” ?
Jesus preeminently inherits the earth , for he is its appointed Ruler .
Hence , those hungering and thirsting for righteousness in effect hunger and thirst for divine guidance .
13 , 14 .
In what practical ways should we show ourselves to be merciful , and with what benefit to us ?
Jesus ’ illustration of the neighborly Samaritan provides a fine example of an individual who “ acted mercifully ” toward a person in need . ​ — Luke 10 : 29 - 37 .
Jesus realized that mankind’s greatest need was spiritual .
How can we be pure in heart and peaceable ?
Happy are the peaceable , since they will be called ‘ sons of God . ’ ”
The peaceable live in peace with their Christian brothers and , as far as it depends on them , with their neighbors .
In anticipation of this , they address Jehovah as their Father , since they dedicate their lives to him , recognizing him as their Life - Giver .
With ‘ the eyes of their heart ’ and through accurate knowledge of God , they perceive Jehovah’s wonderful qualities and endeavor to imitate him by doing his will . ​ — Ephesians 1 : 18 ; Romans 1 : 19 , 20 ; 3 John 11 .
Yet , such ones have always encountered opposition , even persecution .
• In what ways are those who mourn comforted ?
“ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need ”
[ Pictures on page 10 ]
“ Happy are the merciful ”
Earlier , however , in his Sermon on the Mount , he gave his apostles and others the assurance that such opposition would not necessarily endanger their deep - felt happiness .
How could persecution bring happiness ?
Did this undermine their joy or halt their preaching ?
“ [ They ] went their way from before the Sanhedrin , rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name .
Later , the early Christians were persecuted by the Romans because of refusing to practice emperor worship .
He stated : “ Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake . ”
Similarly , the apostle Peter stated : “ Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery , they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you . ” ​ — 1 Peter 4 : 4 .
( a ) Why are the remnant and their companions reproached and persecuted ?
As Jehovah’s Witnesses , we bear witness to Jesus , the now - reigning King of the Kingdom government , which will destroy human governments standing in the way of God’s righteous new world .
For this we are reproached and persecuted , but we count ourselves happy to suffer for the name of Christ . ​ — 1 Peter 4 : 14 .
This was certainly true of the early Christians .
Latourette stated : “ The accusations varied .
The fact that [ the Memorial of Christ’s death ] was celebrated only in the presence of believers fed the rumours that Christians regularly sacrificed an infant and consumed its blood and flesh . ”
In addition , because the early Christians refused to practice emperor worship , they were accused of being enemies of the State .
How did the first - century Christians respond to false accusations made against them , and what is the situation today ?
Those false accusations did not prevent the early Christians from carrying out their commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom .
The same occurs today .
The prophet Jeremiah was put into stocks and later thrown into a miry cistern .
Today , we as Jehovah’s Witnesses are often persecuted because we are zealous in preaching the good news of the Kingdom .
Profound Reasons for Being Happy
The support of the holy spirit is proof that Jehovah’s blessing is upon us , and this brings us great happiness . ​ — Psalm 5 : 12 ; Philippians 1 : 27 - 29 .
We are supremely happy at the thought that our keeping integrity under trial provides a further answer to Satan’s challenge that all of Jehovah’s creatures serve Him out of selfish interest .
15 , 16 . ( a ) What reason did Jesus give for us to “ rejoice and leap for joy ” ?
( b ) What reward is stored up in the heavens for anointed Christians , and how will their “ other sheep ” companions also be rewarded ?
Jesus gave an added reason for joy at being maligned and persecuted like the prophets of old .
Toward the end of the ninth happiness , he stated : “ Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens . ”
The apostle Paul wrote : “ The wages sin pays is death , but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ”
Jesus said that the reward is “ in the heavens ” because it comes from Jehovah .
For both classes , the “ reward ” is unearned .
Jehovah will thus sanctify his great name and deliver his people from persecution .
As that great “ day of Jehovah ” draws ever nearer , let us rejoice because we are “ counted worthy to be dishonored ” for Jesus ’ name .
Who was Amos , and what does the Bible reveal about him ?
Leave this area ! ’
His hometown was Tekoa , ten miles [ 16 km ] south of Jerusalem .
Amos candidly said : “ I was not a prophet , neither was I the son of a prophet . ”
But should that make us feel unqualified to preach God’s word ?
That assignment was a challenge .
At the time , the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel enjoyed peace , security , and material prosperity .
The rich were “ defrauding the lowly ones ” and “ crushing the poor ones . ”
There dishonest merchants made “ the ephah small ” and “ the shekel great , ” even selling “ mere refuse ” as grain .
The merchants cheated their customers in the quantity of what they sold , the price was too high , and the quality was inferior .
Next , the merchants bought them “ for the price of a pair of sandals . ”
At the city gate , where legal cases were handled , the judges ‘ took hush money and turned aside poor people . ’
So the judges too were ignoring God’s Law .
Imagine that !
An Israelite father and his son committed sexual immorality with the same temple prostitute .
Referring to other sinful conduct , Jehovah said : “ On garments seized as a pledge they stretch themselves out beside every altar ; and the wine of those who have been fined they drink at the house of their gods . ”
How far they had strayed from the path of pure worship !
What can we learn from the example of Amos ?
Because of the similarities between our work and that of Amos , we will benefit greatly from considering his example .
Let us consider these points one at a time .
How We Can Imitate Amos
Did these things move Israel to repent ?
Similarly , Jehovah told Amos to give a final warning .
Sadly , Israel ignored that divine message and failed to take the right action .
No doubt you will agree that there are some striking similarities between the time of Amos and our own day .
Jesus Christ prophesied that numerous calamities would take place during the time of the end .
As in Amos ’ day , though , most people today ignore both the signs of the times and the Kingdom message .
Jehovah warned them : “ Get ready to meet your God . ”
Yet , as long as Jehovah’s patience continues , we exhort as many people as possible : “ Search for Jehovah , and keep living . ” ​ — Amos 5 : 6 .
Facing Opposition as Amos Did
We can imitate Amos not only in what we preach but also in how we preach .
So Amaziah was a priest of the State religion .
He said : “ This is what Amos has said . ”
As recorded at Amos 7 : 9 , however , Amos had prophesied : “ I [ Jehovah ] will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword . ”
What an excellent example for us !
When it comes to speaking God’s word , we will not disobey our God , even in lands where modern - day Amaziahs are fomenting cruel persecution .
And opposers can never stop our preaching work , for “ the hand of Jehovah ” is with us . ​ — Acts 11 : 19 - 21 .
Who will not prophesy ? ”
In other words , Amos told his listeners : ‘ Just as you cannot help being afraid when you hear the roar of a lion , so I cannot help preaching God’s word , since I have heard Jehovah’s command to do so . ’
How do we respond to God’s command that we preach the good news ?
That question will be answered in the following article .
[ Picture on page 10 ]
“ Get ready to meet your God . ” ​ — AMOS 4 : 12 .
Why can we be confident that God will end wickedness ?
First , it is always deserved .
Second , it is inescapable .
Imagine that ​ — selling God’s people into slavery !
It is no surprise that Jehovah was going to bring calamity upon Syria , Philistia , and Tyre .
What did Edom , Ammon , and Moab have in common with Israel , but how did they treat the Israelites ?
Edom , Ammon , and Moab had something in common with Israel and with one another .
The Edomites descended from Abraham through Jacob’s twin brother , Esau .
But did Edom , Ammon , and Moab treat their Israelite relatives in a brotherly manner ?
Jehovah would send a fiery destruction upon them .
Recorded history proves that each of them later suffered calamity .
Why , at least four of them ​ — Philistia , Moab , Ammon , and Edom — ​ eventually ceased to exist !
The prophecy of Amos next focused attention on a seventh nation ​ — his home territory of Judah .
Once again we see that for the wicked , there is no escaping divine judgment .
Amos was far from finished !
The prophesying of Amos exposed the oppression that had become common in the kingdom of Israel .
In this regard , Amos 2 : 6 , 7 reads : “ This is what Jehovah has said , ‘ On account of three revolts of Israel , and on account of four , I shall not turn it back , on account of their selling someone righteous for mere silver , and someone poor for the price of a pair of sandals .
Who were being mistreated in the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel ?
They were the righteous , poor , lowly , and meek inhabitants of the land .
( c ) What happened to the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel in 740 B.C.E . ?
Unfaithful Israel could not escape the approaching execution of divine judgment because for the eighth time , Jehovah declared : “ I shall not turn it back . ”
The wicked could not evade the execution of Jehovah’s judgment upon them by digging “ down into Sheol , ” figuratively denoting attempts to hide in the lowest parts of the earth .
17 , 18 .
God can find the wicked and execute judgment upon them wherever they hide .
What happened to a remnant from Israel and Judah ?
Jehovah’s Adverse Judgment Will Come !
Yes , no matter where the wicked may hide , Jehovah will find them .
He eventually gathered back the captive ones of Israel and Judah , returning them to their homeland and blessing them with abundant security and prosperity .
What does this mean for our day ?
It makes us certain that during the execution of divine judgment , Jehovah will find the wicked wherever they hide and will locate individuals he considers deserving of his mercy , no matter where they may live on this earth .
We enjoy a way of worship that is free of the lies and distortions that have resulted from Christendom’s false teachings .
• What proof does Amos provide to show that divine judgment is inescapable ?
• How does the book of Amos show that the execution of God’s judgment is selective ?
The kingdom of Israel did not escape divine judgment
1 , 2 .
So when the Bible says that God sees the heart , it means that he looks beyond outward appearances and focuses on what a person really is .
According to Amos 6 : 4 - 6 , what conditions existed in the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel ?
They were “ eating the rams out of a flock and the young bulls from among fattened calves . ”
Such men had “ devised for themselves instruments for song ” and were “ drinking out of bowls of wine . ”
Very likely , many of these had been attached to furniture and inlaid in wall paneling .
What would happen if the people of Israel did not heed divine warnings ?
The Assyrians would snatch them from their splendid ivory couches and drag them off into captivity .
How had the Israelites come to be in such a state ?
This situation had begun to develop in 997 B.C.E . , when King Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam and ten tribes of Israel separated from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin .
Jeroboam tried to give the new religion an air of respectability .
According to Amos 5 : 21 - 24 , God said : “ I have hated , I have rejected your festivals , and I shall not enjoy the smell of your solemn assemblies .
And let justice roll forth just like waters , and righteousness like a constantly flowing torrent . ”
Present - Day Parallels
11 , 12 .
What parallels can be drawn between worship in ancient Israel and that found in Christendom ?
Clearly , Jehovah examined the hearts of those engaging in Israel’s festivals and rejected their observances and offerings .
Other parallels can be noted between worship carried on by the calf - worshiping Israelites and that found in Christendom .
Since the heart is treacherous , we must do everything in our power to safeguard it .
And if we act on such desires by practicing sin , all the zeal in the world will not bring us back into God’s favor .
Let us therefore pray for God’s help to “ hate what is bad , and love what is good . ”
Others took vows as Nazirites .
How did the other Israelites view the self - sacrificing course of such doers of good things ?
Instead , they unlovingly sought to discourage the loyal ones from giving glory to God .
Their forefathers had eaten only manna in the wilderness for 40 years .
The prophet exposed their spiritually diseased heart condition in these words recorded at Amos 4 : 4 , 5 : “ Come , you people , to Bethel and commit transgression .
They had not safeguarded their hearts .
It must not have been easy for anyone living in Israel in those days to remain faithful to Jehovah .
It is not easy to pursue this course , but doing so leads to everlasting life . ​ — John 17 : 3 .
What famine befalls those who do not practice true worship ?
Famine of the worst kind ​ — spiritual famine !
“ There are days coming , ” said the Sovereign Lord Jehovah , “ and I will send a famine into the land , a famine , not for bread , and a thirst , not for water , but for hearing the words of Jehovah . ”
My own servants will rejoice , but you yourselves will suffer shame . ” ​ — Isaiah 65 : 13 .
As Jehovah’s servants , do we personally appreciate what we have in the way of spiritual provisions and blessings ?
No matter what our present economic situation or what trials we must face in this troubled world , we who love God are enjoying divine blessings and the best spiritual food .
Encourage full - time servants to keep up their good work
( Joshua 1 : 1 – 5 : 15 )
What an assignment Joshua receives when Jehovah tells him : “ Moses my servant is dead ; and now get up , cross this Jordan , you and all this people , into the land that I am giving to them , to the sons of Israel ” !
Although at flood stage , the river proves to be no obstacle to them , for Jehovah causes the waters upstream to rise up like a dam and allows the waters downstream to empty into the Dead Sea .
Rahab protects the spies at the risk of her life because she has come to have faith in Jehovah .
2 : 4 - 13 .
( Joshua 6 : 1 – 12 : 24 )
Only Rahab and her household are saved .
However , about 3,000 soldiers sent to attack the city take to flight from the men of Ai .
Having defeated the Israelites once , the king of Ai is eager to meet them in combat .
Israel’s other conquests under the leadership of Joshua include cities in the south and west , as well as the defeat of the coalition of kings to the north .
10 : 13 ​ — What is the book of Jashar ?
JOSHUA TAKES ON HIS LAST BIG TASK
( Joshua 13 : 1 – 24 : 33 )
Later , Joshua assembles all the tribes of Israel at Shechem .
According to Jewish tradition , Terah might even have been a maker of idols .
However , when Abraham leaves Ur at God’s command , Terah goes with him to Haran . ​ — Genesis 11 : 31 .
22 : 9 - 12 , 21 - 33 .
We can be sure that our hope in God’s promises is not misplaced .

While God’s sovereignty is not dependent on the integrity of his creatures , humans and spirit sons of God can demonstrate where they stand on this issue .
An individual’s integrity , then , is a solid basis on which he or she can be judged .
What will help us stay on the course of integrity ?
Integrity carries the thought of being upright , blameless , righteous , and faultless .
However , integrity involves more than doing what is right .
Along with proper action , integrity requires right heart motivation .
Keeping integrity , however , does not call for perfection .
King David was imperfect and made several serious mistakes during his life .
His heart was devoted to God .
6 , 7 .
It embraces our entire way of life .
In his ways they have walked . ”
David pleaded that his kidneys and his heart be refined .
He made known his ways to Moses , his dealings even to the sons of Israel . ”
Perhaps David was thinking of the defrauding of the Israelites by the Egyptians in the days of Moses .
I have hated the congregation of evildoers , and with the wicked ones I do not sit . ”
What if there are some in the Christian congregation who live double lives ?
They too conceal what they truly are .
14 , 15 .
Why ?
When we think about all that the ransom makes possible , does not our heart become filled with gratitude to Jehovah and his only - begotten Son ?
With thanksgiving in our heart , then , let us make known to others God’s wonderful works ​ — from the creation of man in the garden of Eden to the complete restoration of all things in God’s new world .
Being busy in it helps us keep our hope for the future bright , our faith in God’s promises strong , and our love for Jehovah and fellow humans alive .
“ I Have Loved the Dwelling of Your House ”
Jehovah’s “ reminders ” are discussed at such meetings .
‘ Do Not Take Away My Life ’
Of what sins did David not want to be found guilty ?
What can lead us into the way of the ungodly ?
Some have become enslaved to pornography , which often leads to immoral conduct .
Many youths become romantically involved , even though they are too young to marry .
Dishonest business practices and a tendency to make self - serving decisions are indications of a lack of integrity .
Our keeping integrity under trials makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice
Maintain a Balanced View of the Use of Alcohol
“ Wine is a ridiculer , intoxicating liquor is boisterous , and everyone going astray by it is not wise . ” ​ — PROVERBS 20 : 1 .
Wine and other alcoholic beverages , like vegetation , bread , and oil , are fine provisions from God .
“ Wine is a ridiculer , ” warns the Bible , “ intoxicating liquor is boisterous , and everyone going astray by it is not wise . ”
Excessive drinking bites like a poisonous serpent , causing sickness , mental confusion , even unconsciousness .
In what way is overindulgence in alcohol harmful ?
Some individuals show very little sign of drunkenness even after consuming a number of drinks .
Immoderate use of alcohol exposes one to many dangers ​ — both physical and spiritual .
Among the diseases caused by alcohol abuse are cirrhosis of the liver , alcoholic hepatitis , and such neural disorders as delirium tremens .
Why ?
Alcohol affects the mind .
What spiritual harm can come from immoderate use of alcohol ?
Moreover , the Bible commands : “ Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else , do all things for God’s glory . ”
Such a reputation would bring reproach on , not glory to , Jehovah’s name .
A key to avoiding the dangers of alcohol abuse is knowing where to draw the line , not between overindulgence and drunkenness , but between moderation and overindulgence .
What will help you to decide how much is too much for you ?
When might even one drink be one too many ?
How should you decide what to do when an alcoholic beverage is set before you ?
When an alcoholic beverage is offered or is set before you , the first question to ask is : ‘ Should I drink at all ? ’
If you decide to drink , have clearly in mind your personal limit , and do not exceed that limit .
Have my drinks become stronger ?
Do I use alcohol to escape worries , stress , or problems ?
Do not be like a man who ‘ looks at his natural face in a mirror and immediately forgets what sort of man he is . ’
What if the problem of overindulgence continues despite your efforts ?
Likening a Christian’s life course to a race , or a contest , the apostle Paul said : “ Do you not know that the runners in a race all run , but only one receives the prize ?
Moreover , every man taking part in a contest exercises self - control in all things .
On the contrary , we need to exercise self - control in all things .
• How can you avoid the dangers of alcohol abuse ?

Jehovah Is Our Helper
But there is only so much that a fellow human can do to help .
Furthermore , he assures us that he will never forsake us .
My help is from Jehovah , the Maker of heaven and earth . ”
The psalmist did not raise his eyes to just any mountain .
He will not be drowsy nor go to sleep , he that is guarding Israel . ”
It is not possible for God to allow those trusting in him “ to totter ” or to experience a fall from which they cannot recover .
By day the sun itself will not strike you , nor the moon by night . ”
Jehovah is like a shade to his people , protecting them from the scorching heat of calamity .
No , but as long as we look to him as our Helper , he will safeguard us against all things that could bring us spiritual harm .
They are well aware that Jehovah has great love for his human worshipers and that he wants to help them .
An angel released the apostle Peter from prison .
A touching example is found in Daniel chapter 10 .
He also became disturbed after seeing a frightening vision .
God lovingly dispatched an angel to encourage him .
What is one example of how angels were used to direct the work of preaching the good news ?
On many occasions , holy spirit was used to empower humans to do Jehovah’s will .
Holy spirit empowered the Judges to deliver Israel .
Their success in carrying out their ministry gave powerful evidence of the operation of holy spirit .
By means of his spirit , Jehovah caused his purposes to be revealed to humble ones but hidden from proud ones .
Thus , concerning the things Jehovah provides “ for those who love him , ” the apostle Paul said : “ It is to us God has revealed them through his spirit . ”
Only with the help of holy spirit could a person truly understand God’s will .
15 , 16 .
But while the temple was being repaired , “ the very book of the law , ” possibly by the hand of Moses , was found .
After hearing its contents read , Josiah realized how far the nation had departed from Jehovah’s will , and the king took firm measures to do what was written in the book .
Is it not clear that God’s people in ancient times were helped by the portions of the Sacred Scriptures that were available to them ?
This means that we have the ability to reflect his attributes , including his kindness and compassion .
According to the Bible record , how did Jehovah provide help through fellow believers ?
What would they do ?
Clearly , the inspired record of God’s dealings speaks for itself .
[ Footnote ]
The Roman poet Horace ( 65 ​ — 8 B.C.E . ) , who made the same journey , commented on the discomforts of this stretch of the trip .
Horace described the Marketplace of Appius as “ crammed with boatmen and stingy tavern - keepers . ”

IMAGINE that you are hiking along a mountain trail .
Does Jehovah help his servants as they walk ?
Surely none of us would want to refuse his aid !
In the preceding article , we discussed four ways in which Jehovah helped his people in ancient times .
Doing so , we can become more confident that Jehovah truly is our Helper . ​ — Hebrews 13 : 6 .
Granted , today they do not appear visibly in order to deliver true worshipers from danger .
Even in Bible times , angels only rarely intervened in such a way .
Most of what they did was invisible to human eyes , as is the case today .
We have good reason to feel similarly .
There is considerable evidence of angelic support for our work .
As we freely give of ourselves in this special assignment from Jehovah , we can count on the help of his angels .
This visionary angel evidently pictures the glorified Jesus Christ in heavenly power .
Jehovah has put him in command of all His angelic armies .
This archangel is a powerful source of help indeed .
Why did John suggest that Jesus is our “ helper ” particularly when we “ commit a sin ” ?
We also need to avoid repeating our sins .
What is Jehovah’s spirit , how powerful is it , and why do we need it today ?
Since Jehovah is not using his spirit in those specific ways today , does that mean that we do not need it ?
On the contrary !
It helps us to cultivate beautiful qualities that draw us closer to Jehovah and to our spiritual brothers and sisters .
Yes , Jehovah is the best Father imaginable .
If in faith we sincerely ask him for holy spirit , it is inconceivable that he would deny us this gift .
We have good reason to make that request in our prayers every day .
He has prayed for holy spirit to help him resist this filthy habit .
He has sought counsel from Christian elders , and they have advised him to take decisive action , refraining from even going near such debasing material .
Is he working in harmony with his prayer for the holy spirit to help him ?
Or is he , rather , running the risk of grieving God’s spirit and losing out on this gift ?
Help From God’s Word
Do you see the point of that passage ?
How pleasant it would be to take an afternoon nap in such a spot !
But this psalm is not inviting us to think about rest .
It is painting quite a different picture , one that suggests hard work .
It is a fruit - bearing tree , deliberately “ planted ” in a chosen spot ​ — “ by streams of water . ”
How could one tree grow near more than one stream ?
If in a spiritual sense we flourish like that tree , it is because much work has been done in our behalf .
We are associated with an organization that brings the pure waters of truth right to us , but we must do our part .
Diligent and careful research is often needed in order to find Scriptural counsel that addresses our specific needs .
Besides the elders , each faithful Christian wants to apply the inspired command to keep “ an eye , not in personal interest upon just [ his ] own matters , but also in personal interest upon those of the others . ”
When those in the Christian congregation apply that counsel , beautiful acts of kindness result .
His wife was too distraught emotionally to care for him alone .
Jehovah often cares for us in such ways . ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 ; 18 : 24 .
Would you like Jehovah to use you as a means of helping others ?
Why should we not feel deprived because of not witnessing Jehovah’s spectacular miracles of the past ?
Although we do not live at a time when Jehovah is performing spectacular miracles to carry out his purposes , we need not feel deprived .
Let us be resolved to accept and make full use of Jehovah’s loving help so that we may echo the words of our text for the year 2005 : “ My help is from Jehovah . ” ​ — Psalm 121 : 2 .

“ LOVE your neighbor . ”
Perhaps people in your country feel much the same way .
Both groups claimed to follow Jesus , who taught his followers to love their neighbor .
The world was aghast at the death toll of more than 500,000 men , women , and children .
When India was partitioned , the Islamic nation of Pakistan was born .
As if the foregoing examples were not disturbing enough , the turn of the century brought to the fore the threat of terrorism .
Today , terrorism has put the whole world on alert , and many terrorist groups claim to have religious ties .
Religion is not viewed as a promoter of unity .
Is there a religion that is different ​ — one that can unite mankind ?
United by Love of God
They represented a variety of backgrounds ​ — priests , soldiers , slaves , refugees , tradesmen , professionals , and businesspeople .
Those Christians recognized their primary obligation to love the true God , Jehovah , with all their heart , soul , and mind .
What moved him to obey was primarily love for Jehovah .
Jesus prayed concerning those putting faith in him : “ I make request . . . that they may all be one , just as you , Father , are in union with me and I am in union with you , that they also may be in union with us . ” ​ — John 17 : 20 , 21 ; 1 Peter 2 : 21 .
These examples show that disagreements did not lead to ethnic divisions or to unyielding doctrinal disunity in the first - century Christian congregation .
Can unity be achieved in the same way today ?
Foremost in contributing to the unity enjoyed by Jehovah’s Witnesses is their devotion to Jehovah God .
This means that they strive to be loyal to him under all circumstances .
They do not go to war ; they do nothing to harm anyone .
One day a Protestant priest held a religious service for the soldiers in Günther’s unit .
When he later came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses , who do not participate in war , Günther became part of their worldwide brotherhood .
Ashok and Feema used to belong to an Eastern religion .
Then , there will be no further atrocities , disunity , and division in the name of religion .
[ Footnote ]
[ Pictures on page 4 , 5 ]
“ I set the pattern for you , that , just as I did to you , you should do also . ” ​ — JOHN 13 : 15 .
Indeed , on Nisan 14 , 33 C.E . , shortly before his death , Jesus himself told his followers to imitate him .
During that last night , Jesus mentioned a number of ways in which Christians should strive to be like him .
Then Jesus said : “ If I , although Lord and Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to wash the feet of one another . ”
What humility !
What things make humans proud , but why is pride dangerous ?
“ Jehovah is high , and yet the humble one he sees ; but the lofty one he knows only from a distance . ” ​ — Psalm 138 : 6 ; Proverbs 8 : 13 .
Humble Among Our Brothers
It takes humility to preach the good news , especially in the face of indifference or hostility .
What we have done is what we ought to have done . ’ ”
Further , we can ask for Jehovah’s help to cultivate the proper view of ourselves .
Like the psalmist , we can pray : “ Teach me goodness , sensibleness and knowledge themselves , for in your commandments I have exercised faith . ”
Perhaps they do not view things that way , but clearly , Jesus does .
We need a clear understanding of what is right and what is wrong from Jehovah’s viewpoint .
We gain that understanding only from a study of God’s Word , the Bible .
He can disguise wrong and make it appear acceptable to an unwary Christian .
Study , prayer , and meditation on what we learn will help us to grow to maturity and be among those who “ through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ”
What Bible counsel helps us not to practice lawlessness ?
Many years after Jesus ’ death , the apostle John wrote : “ Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world .
( b ) How can we avoid cultivating a love of things in the world ?
Even so , the world and its attractions can easily distract us from serving Jehovah .
If we watch movies or television programs that highlight violence , materialism , or sexual immorality , those things can become acceptable ​ — and then tempting .
On the other hand , if we find delight in Jehovah’s Word , “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life ” will lose much of their allure .
Hating lawlessness and loving righteousness helped Jesus to keep his eyes on “ the joy that was set before him . ”
Facing Persecution
They are neutral in military and political matters , and they observe Bible principles , respecting the sanctity of life and keeping to a high moral code .
18 , 19 .
Following the pattern of Jesus , how do Christians handle opposition and persecution ?
God’s Kingdom was “ no part of this world ” and had no national boundaries to protect .
Soon Peter would be part of a spiritual nation , whose members would have their citizenship in heaven .
• How is it possible to “ put on the Lord Jesus Christ ” ?
Jesus set the perfect pattern of humility
[ Picture on page 10 ]
Likely , Peter was thinking of what the resurrected Jesus said just before he ascended to heaven .
However , for some time before that , Peter had known that as a disciple of Jesus , he would have to talk to others about his faith in Jesus .
What miracle did Jesus perform , and what invitation did he offer to Peter and Andrew ?
Several months after his baptism in 29 C.E . , Jesus preached where Peter and his brother Andrew worked as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee .
Jesus ’ disciples would give a thorough witness as Jesus did but on a much larger scale .
We are living in “ the conclusion of the system of things . ”
What quality of Jesus made his ministry effective , and how can we imitate him in this respect ?
The Bible says about one occasion : “ On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them , because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ”
We today will be effective if we show the same concern for people .
Think of the problems they may have that only the Kingdom will solve .
Perhaps the next person you approach has been praying for someone like you to come and help him !
The apostle John said : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments , ” including the commandment to preach the good news and make disciples . ​ — 1 John 5 : 3 ; Matthew 28 : 19 , 20 .
Shepherd my little sheep . . . .
What should move Peter to do that ?
Jesus indicated the answer when he repeatedly asked Peter : “ Do you love me ? . . .
Do you love me ? . . .
Our hearts are moved by the great love that led him to “ taste death for every man . ”
We feel as Paul felt when he wrote : “ The love the Christ has compels us . . .
Jesus , though , rejected that kind of thinking .
13 , 14 . ( a ) What failed to distract Jesus from his focus ?
He did not even have his own home .
When Jesus died , the only recorded thing of value that he owned was the garment over which the Roman soldiers cast lots .
And how we rejoice in the reward he received because he kept his focus on doing God’s will ! ​ — Psalm 40 : 8 ; Acts 2 : 32 , 33 , 36 .
When a Christian dies , his material wealth is of no more value to him than Jesus ’ garment was to him when he died .
How did Jesus face up to opposition ?
However , like Jesus we look to Jehovah for support as we determinedly put the Kingdom first in our lives . ​ — Matthew 6 : 33 ; Romans 15 : 13 ; 1 Corinthians 2 : 4 .
Jesus ’ refusal to be distracted was demonstrated when he began to tell his disciples about his coming death .
20 , 21 .
Paul wrote : “ As long as we have time favorable for it , let us work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith . ”
We want to help our neighbors .
( b ) Who today are giving a thorough witness ?
Like Jesus , we do not lose our focus when others mock us or angrily reject our message .
Others have been able to move to where the fishing is more productive and have obtained a fine catch there .
That report will demonstrate Jehovah’s rich blessing on the preaching work .
Starting this year , the Service Year Report of Jehovah’s Witnesses Worldwide will not appear in the January 1 issue of The Watchtower .
Can You Answer ?
We will be effective in our ministry if we show the same concern for people that Jesus did
[ Pictures on page 17 ]
Did Stephen really pray to Jesus ?
Scholar Abiel Abbot Livermore called this “ an instance of the sectarian biases of the translators . ”
Nevertheless , many versions do say that Stephen “ prayed ” to Jesus .
Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words explains that in this setting , the original Greek word , e·pi·ka·leʹo , means : “ To call upon , invoke ; . . . to appeal to an authority . ”
Paul used this same word when he declared : “ I appeal to Caesar ! ”
But seeing the resurrected Jesus in vision , Stephen apparently felt free to appeal to him directly , saying : “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ”
Not at all .
The only other case of such an utterance being directed to Jesus is that of the apostle John , who similarly addressed Jesus directly when he saw Him in vision . ​ — Revelation 22 : 16 , 20 .
As it did Stephen , so faith in Jesus ’ ability to raise his followers from the dead can help and sustain us in times of trial .
1 , 2 . ( a ) Starting in 29 C.E . , what decision confronted Israel ?
( b ) What will be considered in this article ?
The ministry of John the Baptizer has heightened the sense of expectation .
Soon , crowds follow Jesus to listen to his teaching and to be healed by him .
Jesus Himself Gives the Evidence
The defense that Jesus gives in his own behalf presents three powerful lines of reasoning that would convince any honesthearted Jew of Jesus ’ true identity .
First , Jesus points to the witness of his forerunner , John the Baptizer , saying : “ You have dispatched men to John , and he has borne witness to the truth .
He points to his own fine works as evidence of God’s backing .
“ What are we to do , because this man performs many signs ? ” certain ones later ask .
Finally , Jesus draws attention to an unassailable witness .
“ The Scriptures . . . are the very ones that bear witness about me , ” he says , adding : “ If you believed Moses you would believe me , for that one wrote about me . ”
Of course , Moses was just one of the many pre - Christian witnesses who wrote about the Christ .
Fortified by a Prophetic Vision
“ Truly I say to you , ” Jesus says , “ there are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . ”
This visionary preview is called the transfiguration .
Six days later , Jesus takes Peter , James , and John up into a lofty mountain ​ — likely a ridge of Mount Hermon .
12 , 13 .
True , Peter had recently testified that Jesus is “ the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
What a faith - strengthening experience the transfiguration vision is for Peter , James , and John !
With their faith thus greatly fortified , they are now better prepared for what lies ahead and for the important role they will play in the future congregation .
Over 30 years later , Peter writes : “ [ Jesus ] received from God the Father honor and glory , when words such as these were borne to him by the magnificent glory : ‘ This is my son , my beloved , whom I myself have approved . ’ Yes , these words we heard borne from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain . ”
John is so deeply moved by these spectacular visions that when Jesus says : “ Yes ; I am coming quickly , ” John exclaims : “ Amen !
Come , Lord Jesus . ” ​ — Revelation 1 : 1 , 10 ; 22 : 20 .
Honesthearted ones living in the first century accept Jesus as the Messiah and put faith in him .
We too must strengthen our faith by taking full advantage of all of Jehovah’s provisions for our spiritual welfare .
Preserved Through Darkness and Tribulation
What sharp contrast existed in the first century between Jesus ’ followers and those who opposed God’s purpose , and how did things turn out for each group ?
Faithful Christians , however , escape .
Why ?
Because when the first siege is lifted , they obey Jesus ’ command to flee . ​ — Luke 21 : 20 - 22 .
For instance , they discerned that it would be invisible , as implied by the two angels who appeared in 33 C.E . to the disciples while Jesus was ascending to heaven .
After a cloud caught Jesus up from the disciples ’ vision , the angels said : “ This Jesus who was received up from you into the sky will come thus in the same manner as you have beheld him going into the sky . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 9 - 11 .
[ Footnote ]
Do You Recall ?
• How did Jesus ’ early disciples benefit from the transfiguration ?
• What did Jesus mean when he said that John would remain until he came ?
Foregleams of God’s Kingdom Become a Reality
“ You are doing well in paying attention to [ the prophetic word ] as to a lamp shining in a dark place . ” ​ — 2 PETER 1 : 19 .
Many will cleanse themselves and whiten themselves and will be refined .
When a Foregleam Becomes a Reality
Likewise , in this time of the end , Jehovah has strengthened the faith of his modern - day servants by shedding increased light on the fulfillment of that awesome vision and many related prophecies .
The understanding that Jesus has corulers is in harmony with a visionary foregleam of the enthroned Messiah that the prophet Daniel was granted .
Who are the holy ones in Daniel’s vision ?
Has their work borne fruit ?
Absolutely !
( a ) How did Jesus ’ ride of conquest get off to a glorious start ?
Jesus ’ first victory was over his most powerful foes ​ — Satan and the demons .
Expelling them from heaven , he hurled them down to the earth .
In line with Jesus ’ prophecy concerning “ the sign of [ his ] presence and of the conclusion of the system of things , ” their ride has resulted in warfare , famine , and deadly plague .
Why do most people not discern Christ’s invisible presence ?
Why ?
Because Satan has blinded their minds .
In time , these so - called Christians adopted pagan festivals , practices , and teachings , even labeling them “ Christian . ”
For example , Christmas has its origin in rites involving the worship of the pagan deities Mithra and Saturn .
In his work De Civitate Dei ( The City of God ) , Augustine of Hippo ( 354 - 430 C.E . ) stated that the church itself is the Kingdom of God .
Such a trend is quite noticeable in Europe .
What does this betoken for false religion ?
Be Prepared for God’s Great Day
Why is the growing ill will toward Babylon the Great significant ?
Should true Christians fear that event and the other aspects of the “ great tribulation ” that will follow ?
After the destruction of Babylon the Great , in his role as Gog of Magog , Satan will launch an all - out attack against Jehovah’s peaceful Witnesses .
What a shock awaits them !
And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True . . .
( b ) What questions should we ask ourselves ?
Have anxieties of life , materialism , or persecution affected them ?
Perhaps some have found certain information published by “ the faithful and discreet slave ” hard to grasp .
How has consideration of the transfiguration vision and related prophecies affected you ?
The transfiguration vision was given to Jesus ’ disciples when they needed encouragement .
As we contemplate these glorious realities and their future significance , may we too express with all our heart the sentiments of the apostle John when he said : “ Amen !
A foregleam becomes a reality
Highlights From the Book of Judges
The book of Judges answers these and other vital questions .
( Judges 1 : 1 – 3 : 6 )
Moreover , the people proceed to form marriage alliances with the Canaanites and to serve their gods .
But in his deathbed prophecy , Jacob foretold that Reuben was not to excel , having forfeited his right as the firstborn .
We must have a regular program of Bible study so as ‘ not to forget Jehovah’s doings . ’
Jehovah allows bad things to happen to his disobedient people for a purpose ​ — to chastise them , to refine them , and to move them to return to him .
Tola , Jair , Ibzan , Elon , and Abdon are also among the 12 men who judge Israel .
The period of the Judges ends with Samson , who fights against the Philistines .
Animals suitable for sacrifice were not likely kept in Israelite homes .
Jephthah was aware that the one coming out of his house to meet him might well be his daughter .
Lessons for Us :
Gideon’s modesty teaches us three important lessons : ( 1 ) When a privilege of service is extended to us , we should reflect on the responsibility it entails rather than dwell on the prominence or prestige that may be associated with it .
How foolish to act proudly and harbor ambition for position or power !
13 : 8 .
In teaching their children , parents should pray to Jehovah for guidance and follow his direction . ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 16 .

1 , 2 . ( a ) What rare quality did Jesus portray in one of his Kingdom parables ?
IS THERE something that you value so highly that you would give everything you own or sacrifice all that you have in order to gain possession of it ?
Jesus Christ referred to this rare but admirable quality in one of his many thought - provoking parables about the Kingdom of God .
It is a parable , or illustration , that Jesus told his disciples in private , one often referred to as the parable of the pearl of great price .
One source observes that according to the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder , pearls occupied the “ topmost rank among all things of price . ”
It is well - known that certain types of oysters can turn irritants ​ — small fragments of stone , for instance — ​ into lustrous pearls by enveloping them in layers of a secretion known as nacre .
To find truly valuable pearls , a great deal of effort is involved .
Even though fine pearls have long commanded high prices , it is evidently not their monetary value that constituted the central lesson of Jesus ’ parable .
( b ) The parable of the hidden treasure reveals what about the traveling merchant ?
He said : “ The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found and hid ; and for the joy he has he goes and sells what things he has and buys that field . ”
Is there a treasure worth such a sacrifice ?
For three and a half years , he taught multitudes about the Kingdom .
The Gospels do not tell us much about what they did immediately after this first encounter with Jesus .
Apparently , most of them returned to their normal course of life .
* Seeing them , Jesus said : “ Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
Was the disciples ’ prompt response a spur - of - the - moment decision ?
Hardly !
Even though they did return to their family fishing business after their first contact with Jesus , there is no doubt that what they had seen and heard on that occasion left a deep impression on their heart and mind .
The passing of nearly a year would have allowed them plenty of time to reflect on such matters .
Thus , as the accounts tell us , without hesitation they gave up everything and became Jesus ’ followers .
Some even begged off when Jesus invited them to become his followers .
As Jesus continued in his ministry , he trained and helped others to reach out for the Kingdom .
For the next two years or so , they accompanied Jesus on his preaching tours throughout the land , enjoying a close relationship with him .
All of this no doubt touched them deeply , so much so that like the traveling merchant , they were zealous and wholehearted in their pursuit of the Kingdom .
He also told them about the trials and hardships ahead and instructed them to tell people : “ The kingdom of God has come near to you . ”
But perhaps to their surprise , Jesus revealed that an even greater joy was in store for them because of their zeal for the Kingdom .
What joy and satisfaction must have filled their heart when the apostles heard those words from Jesus !
In addition , the apostle John saw in vision “ a great crowd , which no man was able to number , . . . standing before the throne and before the Lamb , . . . saying : ‘ Salvation we owe to our God , who is seated on the throne , and to the Lamb . ’ ”
19 , 20 . ( a ) What opportunity is open to people of all the nations ?
Thus , people out of all nations would come to be disciples of Jesus Christ .
So in our day , are there still individuals like the traveling merchant , who are willing to give their all in the pursuit of God’s Kingdom ?
Can You Explain ?
• What is the central lesson of the parable of the traveling merchant ?
Even some who became Jesus ’ followers did not fully understand what God’s Kingdom is or what they must do to receive the blessing of becoming associate rulers with Christ . ​ — Matthew 20 : 20 - 22 ; Luke 19 : 11 ; Acts 1 : 6 .
With reference to our time , what did Jesus say about the Kingdom ?
What , then , about today ?
Nevertheless , he gave this assurance : “ He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved . ”
It attracts all kinds of persons . ”
This took place in 235 lands , in which Jehovah’s Witnesses are conducting 6,085,387 home Bible studies weekly in order to help people from all walks of life and out of many nations , tribes , and tongues to take in the life - giving truth from God’s Word . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 .
At age 79 , Brother Macmillan wrote : “ From my first glimpse of the promises held out to sick and dying mankind my hope in what that message of the Bible has revealed has not faded .
She said : “ Since my childhood , God has been my very best friend .
Her enthusiastic approach soon brought ridicule from her schoolmates .
They Do Not Give Up
Like the merchant in Jesus ’ parable , those who take up this service are willing to travel to faraway places for the sake of the Kingdom .
In many lands , they have to endure extraordinary hardship .
What exciting experiences are enjoyed by missionaries in such faraway places as Central African Republic ?
Often , passersby take note of what is happening and simply join in the study .
What an example of faith and perseverance for all of us !
Yet , we never regretted our decision to be missionaries . ”
His wife adds : “ There has always been so much to be grateful for .
When you see the students come to the meetings and get to know one another , it is like a family get - together each time . ”
( b ) What sobering questions could each of us ask himself ?
Millions of others around the world have responded to the Kingdom good news in a similar way .
They have come out of the wicked world , put off their old personality , left their former associates , and given up their worldly pursuits .
Do you feel the same way about the Kingdom good news ?
Those who have offered themselves include the “ company of young men just like dewdrops ” and “ a large army ” of “ women telling the good news . ”
A pioneer , or full - time Kingdom proclaimer , in India wondered how the more than two million deaf people in that land might be helped to learn about the Kingdom .
There she was able to share the Kingdom hope with many deaf ones , and Bible study groups were formed .
The young man was to return to Calcutta , some 1,000 miles [ 1,600 km ] away , to start college , and there were no Witnesses there who knew sign language .
The branch office in India is now arranging for pioneers to learn sign language to help in that field .
Take a little time to examine it , and see for yourself the evidence that Jehovah’s people around the earth are intensely focused on pursuing the “ pearl of high value ” today .
Realistically , some might ask : ‘ How would the merchant find food , clothing , and shelter now that he had nothing to fall back on ?
• What changes have individuals made because of the Kingdom good news ?

How do you react when someone draws a wrong conclusion about you , and what lesson can we learn from such an experience ?
From this , we can learn an important lesson : It is wise to avoid jumping to conclusions when we do not have the whole picture .
We do well to keep this lesson in mind when it comes to reaching conclusions about Jehovah God .
Why is that ?
Because there are certain Bible accounts that may at first seem puzzling .
These accounts ​ — perhaps about the actions of some of God’s worshipers or God’s past judgments — ​ may not contain enough details to answer all our questions .
Why Accept Jehovah’s Judgments ?
First , because Jehovah knows all the facts involved and we do not , we should be modest when considering God’s actions .
To illustrate : Imagine that a judge with an outstanding record of making fair - minded decisions has handed down a sentence in a court case .
( b ) What should we remember if we read something in the Bible that causes us to wonder whether God acted in a just or right way ?
In giving his Son as a ransom for delivering obedient mankind from sin and death , Jehovah satisfied his just and righteous standards .
So , then , if we read something in the Bible that causes some to wonder whether God acted in a just or right way , we should remember this : Because of his loyalty to his standards of righteousness and justice , Jehovah did not spare his own Son from undergoing a painful death .
Would he compromise those standards in other matters ?
Why would it be inconsistent for humans to imagine that justice and righteousness could somehow be lacking in Jehovah ?
If we become troubled over a particular Bible account , we need to remember that because of our inherited sin , our sense of what is just and right is imperfect .
Who are we ​ — the pottery of his hand — ​ to question his decisions or actions ?
When the patriarch Job misunderstood God’s dealings with mankind , Jehovah corrected him , asking : “ Really , will you invalidate my justice ?
Realizing that he had spoken without understanding , Job later repented .
With this foundation for understanding Jehovah’s ways , let us examine two Bible accounts that some may find puzzling .
In Genesis chapter 19 , we find the account of what happened when God sent two materialized angels to Sodom .
Lot insisted that the visitors stay in his home .
Did Lot act with God’s approval ?
The Bible also does not tell us what Lot was thinking or what motivated him to act as he did .
He was placed in a difficult situation .
By saying that the visitors had “ come under the shadow ” of his roof , Lot indicated that he felt compelled to provide protection and refuge for them .
* Subsequently , Sarah was taken to the household of Pharaoh .
Significantly , Jehovah through his angels did intervene , and the young women were kept safe .
( b ) Whatever Lot’s reasoning , of what can we be sure ?
In addition , the young women were engaged to men of the city , so relatives , friends , or business associates of his prospective sons - in - law might well have been in the crowd .
A mob thus divided would not be nearly so dangerous .
Why Did Jehovah Strike Uzzah Dead ?
Uzzah was only trying to save the Ark . ’
Was Uzzah perhaps a presumptuous man , prone to overstep due bounds ?
Was Uzzah so faithless as to think that Jehovah’s hand was too short to steady the sacred chest that symbolized His presence ?
A Sound Basis for Confidence
How is Jehovah’s wisdom seen in that his Word at times omits certain details ?
[ Footnotes ]
“ APATHEISM . ”
A commentator on religious affairs recently used that word to describe the stance many people maintain toward their faith .
False religion has misled and disappointed mankind for so long .
We strive to “ maintain [ our ] conduct fine among the nations . ” ​ — 1 Peter 2 : 12 ; 2 Peter 3 : 11 , 14 .
As a result , Jesus ’ followers “ repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and . . . live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things . ” ​ — Titus 2 : 12 .
Our clear view of our identity and our relationship with the Sovereign Ruler of the universe motivates us to “ boast in Jehovah . ”
We follow the admonition : “ Let the one bragging about himself brag about himself because of this very thing , the having of insight and the having of knowledge of me , that I am Jehovah , the One exercising loving - kindness , justice and righteousness in the earth . ”
We “ boast ” in the privilege of knowing God and of being used by him to assist others .
Some Christians may occasionally go through periods of self - doubt and of a reassessment of their values and goals .
or ‘ I am incapable ! ’
He was not a fluent speaker .
No wonder he felt unfit to become the liberator of God’s enslaved people !
In addition , Jehovah was indicating that he would without fail deliver his people .
For instance , through Moses he said to the nation of Israel as they were about to enter the Promised Land : “ Be courageous and strong . . . .
He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely . ”
How was Asaph affected ?
“ My steps had nearly been made to slip .
The turning point for Asaph was a visit to the temple sanctuary .
With his spiritual appreciation renewed , he understood that Jehovah hated badness and that in due time the wicked would be punished .
Consider Joseph , the son of Jacob .
He was proud to be a worshiper of Jehovah even in a hostile environment , and he did not shy away from expressing how he felt . ​ — Genesis 39 : 7 - 10 .
What is involved in boasting in our Christian identity ?
Obviously , a halfhearted continuation of family tradition cannot sustain an intimate , long - term relationship with Jehovah .
It extends from the faithful man Abel ​ — about 60 centuries ago — ​ to the “ great crowd ” of modern Witnesses and on to throngs of worshipers of Jehovah who will enjoy an endless future .

Do You Recall ?
• What Bible characters took pride in their service to God ?
Many ancient servants of Jehovah took pride in their distinct identity
Why can it be challenging to maintain a strong sense of Christian identity ?
This is especially true of young ones who are being raised in Christian families .
“ Though I was attending Christian meetings , ” admitted one such youth , “ I had no clear spiritual goals and , frankly , no crystallized desire to serve Jehovah . ”
For example , many in the world today view the Bible’s standards of morality as old - fashioned or unrealistic in our modern world .
Some feel that it is not vital to worship God in the way that he directs .
How can we safeguard our Christian identity ?
( a ) How can testing by Jehovah benefit us ?
It would not be enough for young Solomon to watch how his own father built faith in Jehovah .
Jehovah’s spirit can help us to comprehend even difficult subjects .
We should pray for God’s help when we are having problems understanding something .
Jehovah wants us to understand his Word , believe it , and obey it .
( a ) What natural desire can ensnare us ?
Seek to please God , not man .
When outside pressure threatens to damage our sense of Christian identity , it is good to remember that our loyalty to God is far more important than public opinion or the trends of the majority .
Are you similarly willing to resist the pressure of popular opinion in order to safeguard your relationship with God ?
Why is it the course of wisdom to make known our identity as Christians ?
Show that you are proud of your moral standards .
No matter how determined you are , you are never going to convince people who have no desire to be convinced .
Trust and faith in God can help us overcome fear . ​ — Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 ; 29 : 25 .
This inheritance includes the truth of Jehovah’s Word , the hope of everlasting life , and the honor to represent God as proclaimers of the good news .
Remember , it is none other than Jehovah who affirms : “ You are my witnesses . ” ​ — Isaiah 43 : 10 .
Reviewing remarkable events from the modern - day history of Jehovah’s organization can impress upon us that no person or thing can eradicate Jehovah’s people from the face of the earth . ​ — Isaiah 54 : 17 ; Jeremiah 1 : 19 .
Immersing ourselves in other theocratic activities , such as Christian meetings , programs for building places of worship , efforts to help those in need , and the like , can deepen our sense of identity as Christians . ​ — Galatians 6 : 9 , 10 ; Hebrews 10 : 23 , 24 .
( b ) What gives us the basis for our true identity ?
Our lives are adorned by a clear sense of purpose , by deep meaning , and by wholesome , productive goals .
And we have been given the hope of an eternal future . ​ — Psalm 37 : 9 .
[ Footnote ]
During the night watches , he went through the temple to see whether its Levite guards were awake or asleep at their posts .
Immersing ourselves in Christian activities can enhance our Christian identity
Note these Bible accounts .
Later , Israel’s King Saul tried to kill David .
Why ?
Because he was envious of David .
In the first century , two Christian women , Euodia and Syntyche , disturbed the peace of an entire congregation with their arguing . ​ — Philippians 4 : 2 .
Their quarreling became public , and the congregation they served split into factions .
The Church of England Newspaper mentioned that the day he retired was the feast day of “ Saint ” Victricius .
A fourth - century bishop who was reportedly flogged because he refused to fight in an army .
Those priests could have avoided injuring themselves and others had they applied the counsel at Romans 12 : 17 , 18 : “ Return evil for evil to no one .
Provide fine things in the sight of all men .
Or are you prompt to apologize ?
WHEN we look at the Christian congregation , is it not heartwarming to see so many married couples who have been loyal to their mates for 10 , 20 , 30 , or even more years ?
Most would admit that their marriage has not been without its challenges .
There are good times and bad times . . .
What do statistics indicate about marriage and divorce , leading to what questions ?
In contrast , millions of marriages have suffered shipwreck .
And half of those [ divorces ] will happen within the first 7.8 years of marriage . . .
What is needed to make a success of marriage in spite of Satan’s efforts to undermine that arrangement ?
What are some factors that can undermine a marriage ?
For men will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , self - assuming , haughty , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , without love of goodness , betrayers , headstrong , puffed up with pride , lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God , having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power ; and from these turn away . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 .
Why is a ‘ lover of self ’ endangering his or her marriage , and what is the Bible’s counsel in this regard ?
When we analyze Paul’s words , we see that many of the things he listed could contribute to the breakdown of marital relationships .
For example , those who are “ lovers of themselves ” are selfish and lack consideration for others .
The apostle Paul wisely counseled Christians , including married couples : “ [ You should be ] doing nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism , but with lowliness of mind considering that the others are superior to you , keeping an eye , not in personal interest upon just your own matters , but also in personal interest upon those of the others . ” ​ — Philippians 2 : 3 , 4 .
Paul also said that some in these last days would be “ disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement . ”
The marriage vow is a solemn promise that should lead to a permanent bond , not to treachery .
He failed to recognize what was inappropriate conduct for a married man .
She was deeply hurt when she saw this happening and tactfully tried to warn him of the dangerous path he was treading .
Even though kind warnings were given , the offending partner did not want to pay attention .
The offending spouse gradually ceases to be loyal to the mate to whom he or she vowed lifelong fidelity .
Jesus said : “ You heard that it was said , ‘ You must not commit adultery . ’
Let her own breasts intoxicate you at all times .
With her love may you be in an ecstasy constantly .
( b ) Why is a wise use of speech vital in marriage ?
Those two voices are a very real component of a marriage union .
If you can find only seven , ask yourself , ‘ Am I willing to overlook the three that are missing ?
Of course , you need to be realistic .
The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord , how he may gain the Lord’s approval .
However , the married woman is anxious for the things of the world , how she may gain the approval of her husband . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 7 : 32 - 34 .
What can contribute to the weakening of the marriage bond ?
Did she notice any warning signs before the breakup ?
She explains : “ He reached a point where he no longer prayed .
They pray together and study together .
( a ) What two things contribute to a successful marriage ?
( b ) How does Paul describe Christian love ?
Then , minor faults or mildly irritating habits may become major problems .
If that happens , Christians need to display the fruitage of the spirit , an aspect of which is love .
Realistically , it does not expect perfection . ​ — Proverbs 10 : 12 .
With experience , a husband or a wife learns to listen not only to what is said but also to what is not said .
Some wives have said that their husbands do not really listen to them .
( b ) What will motivate us to apologize ?
It takes humility to admit one’s mistakes .
A sincere apology can remove a possible future cause for conflict and pave the way for real forgiveness and a solution to the problem .
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you , so do you also .
But , besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 13 , 14 .
A Christian husband and wife should be able to trust each other , to rely on each other .
Neither should undermine the other or in other ways diminish his or her self - confidence .

[ Footnote ]
• Why is a hasty marriage unwise ?
Marriage is more than just a romantic relationship
Marriage is a lifelong commitment , not a casual agreement that can be lightly abandoned .
One marriage counselor said : “ A good marriage is a process of continual change as it reflects new issues , deals with problems that arise , and uses the resources available at each stage of life . ”
Two thousand years ago , the apostle Paul gave wise counsel to Christian couples when he wrote : “ As the congregation is in subjection to the Christ , so let wives also be to their husbands in everything .
Christian wives who keep in humble submission to their husbands imitate the congregation in recognizing and observing the headship principle .
That principle applies with special force in marriage .
A man should feed and cherish his wife with the same diligence that he feeds and cherishes himself .
How can wives imitate the Christian congregation ?
Continue Dwelling With Them
The apostle Peter also had counsel for married couples , and his words to husbands were especially pointed .
How , then , can husbands assign honor to their wives ?
To honor one’s wife means to treat her lovingly , with respect and dignity .
In law she remained for ever a child . . . .
In what ways are women equal to men ?
And as Peter said , both husband and wife are “ heirs . . . of the undeserved favor of life . ”
Hence , his words reminded Christian husbands that as “ joint heirs with Christ , ” they and their wives had the same heavenly hope .
Both men and women of the “ great crowd ” wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb .
Besides , the marriage is still valid in Jehovah’s eyes ; they are still “ one flesh . ”
How can husbands help unbelieving wives ?
“ The Secret Person of the Heart ”
What kind of conduct might win over a husband ?
For so , too , formerly the holy women who were hoping in God used to adorn themselves , subjecting themselves to their own husbands , as Sarah used to obey Abraham , calling him ‘ lord . ’
And you have become her children , provided you keep on doing good and not fearing any cause for terror . ” ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 3 - 6 .
Not only is such a spirit pleasing to a husband but it is “ of great value in the eyes of God . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 12 .
How is Sarah a fine example for Christian wives ?
Sarah is pointed to as a model , and she is a worthy example for Christian wives whether their husbands are believers or not .
For Christians , economic stresses , human imperfection , and the spirit of the world with its immorality and distorted sense of values can test loyalties .
After counseling married men and women , the apostle Peter concluded with warm words of encouragement .
Wise counsel indeed for all , especially for married couples !

Maria relates : “ My relationship with the teacher did not suffer .
They want us to be ourselves . ”
Throughout the school year , Maria’s stand earned her the respect of teachers and classmates alike .
Maria says : “ Bible principles help me in my life .

Highlights From the Book of Ruth
Pointing to the older of the two , the women of the town keep asking : “ Is this Naomi ? ”
Some time after they settle in Moab , though , her husband , Elimelech , dies .
However , Ruth sticks with Naomi , saying : “ Where you go I shall go , and where you spend the night I shall spend the night .
1 : 8 ​ — Why did Naomi tell her daughters - in - law to return “ each one to the house of her mother ” instead of to the house of her father ?
In view of all that had happened to her , however , she thought that Jehovah was against her .
Lacking grandchildren and with two sons dead , Naomi might have felt justified in thinking that Jehovah had humiliated her .
2 : 12 ​ — What “ perfect wage ” did Ruth receive from Jehovah ?
Ruth had a son and received the privilege of becoming a link in history’s most important lineage ​ — that of Jesus Christ . ​ — Ruth 4 : 13 - 17 ; Matthew 1 : 5 , 16 .
1 : 8 ; 2 : 20 .
Despite the tragedies she experienced , Naomi maintained her confidence in Jehovah’s loving - kindness .
Orpah “ returned to her people and her gods . ”
Ruth did not .
She left the comfort and security of her native land and remained loyal to Jehovah .
Cultivating loyal love for God and manifesting a self - sacrificing spirit will help protect us from succumbing to selfish desires and ‘ shrinking back to destruction . ’ ​ — Hebrews 10 : 39 .
She was humble at heart .
What a fine example for us ! ​ — Genesis 34 : 1 , 2 ; 1 Corinthians 15 : 33 .
It was not “ the external braiding of the hair ” or “ the putting on of gold ornaments or the wearing of outer garments ” that caused others to admire Ruth .
Any God - fearing woman desiring a reputation like that of Ruth must strive to cultivate these qualities . ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 3 , 4 ; Proverbs 31 : 28 - 31 .
Ruth’s actions that night were apparently in line with what was customarily done by a woman seeking the right of brother - in - law marriage .
She acted in harmony with Naomi’s instruction .
Boaz would see to it that she would have “ a resting - place ” in the house of her husband .
It may also be that six measures of barley is all that Ruth could carry on her head .
The question , though , may also mean that Naomi was inquiring about Ruth’s possible new identity in connection with her being repurchased .
First of all , if the one falling into poverty had sold his land inheritance , a repurchaser would have to put out money to buy the land at a price determined by the number of years remaining till the next Jubilee .
Lessons for Us :
Although she was a Moabitess and a former worshiper of the god Chemosh , what a privilege Ruth received !
Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz placed their complete trust in Jehovah’s arrangement , and things worked out well for them .
What Scriptural command moved Jesus ’ first - century followers to overcome selfishness ?
By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
True Christians are to display self - sacrificing love for one another and put the needs of their fellow believers ahead of their own .
3 , 4 . ( a ) Why should we counteract selfishness ?
The apostle Paul warned : “ In the last days . . . men will become utterly self - centred . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 , 2 , Phillips .
The three steps that Jesus outlined , as recorded in that scripture , are to be taken by believers .
First , we must disown ourselves .
The Greek word for “ to disown oneself ” indicates a willingness to say no to selfish desires or personal convenience .
Third , Jesus Christ said that we must continually follow him .
Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father and for his disciples left no room for selfishness .
“ The Christ did not please himself , ” wrote Paul .
Our doing so counteracts selfishness ​ — a sure obstacle to displaying self - sacrificing love .
Moreover , Jesus said : “ Whoever wants to save his soul will lose it ; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it .
“ He went away grieved , for he was holding many possessions . ”
They gave me 24 hours to decide which I preferred ​ — a life of luxury or the truth .
If I didn’t cut off all contact with the Witnesses , my family would disinherit me .
The desire to live no longer for themselves has moved thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses to serve as pioneers , or full - time Kingdom proclaimers .
In one way or another , all of us can show that Kingdom interests come first in our lives . ​ — Matthew 6 : 33 .
Paul wrote : “ The love the Christ has compels us , because this is what we have judged , that one man died for all . . .
We have left all things and followed you ; what actually will there be for us ? ”
Peter and the other apostles had truly disowned themselves .
What would be their reward ?
He said : “ No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time . . . and in the coming system of things everlasting life . ”
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
We thus become slaves of God .
• Why is living a life of self - sacrifice worthwhile ?
[ Picture on page 11 ]
What prevented the young ruler from following Jesus ?
“ You were bought with a price .
( b ) What choice did the slave who loved his master have ?
“ SLAVERY was prevalent and widely accepted in the ancient world , ” states the Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary .
In the seventh year , he was to “ go out as one set free without charge . ”
Was it not love for his master ?
What , though , does becoming slaves of God and of Christ involve ?
“ Do All Things for God’s Glory ”
Our servitude is voluntary and stems from our love for the Master .
“ This is what the love of God means , ” states 1 John 5 : 3 , “ that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ”
For us , then , our obedience is proof of our love as well as our submission .
Illustrate this with an example .
He seemed to be a nice person , and he was already studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
If I had pursued that relationship , I would now be married to an unbeliever . ”
True , none of us like to be unpopular , but we must bear in mind that Christians have standards that are different from those in the world .
Paul asked : “ Am I seeking to please men ? ”
“ But I prepared well , and the results were surprising .
I won the respect of many of my fellow students , and the teacher told me that he admired the work I was doing .
Above all , I felt satisfied that I had defended the name of Jehovah and had been able to explain clearly the reasons for my Scriptural stand . ”
Yes , as slaves of God and of Christ , we stand out as different .
However , we may well win people’s respect if we are prepared to defend our beliefs respectfully . ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 15 .
What do we learn from an angel who appeared to the apostle John ?
Give Scriptural examples to show that faithful servants of God did not always find it easy to do his will .
11 , 12 . ( a ) Briefly relate Jesus ’ illustration recorded at Luke 17 : 7 - 10 . ( b ) What lesson do we derive from Jesus ’ illustration ?
Jesus spoke of a slave who had been caring for his master’s flock all day in the field .
Jesus did not give this illustration to show that Jehovah does not appreciate what we do in his service .
The Bible clearly states : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
What about the times when we come home tired after a long day’s work ?
Paul himself recognized that there could be times when we declare the good news ‘ against our will . ’
However , we do these things because Jehovah ​ — our heavenly Master , whom we love — ​ tells us that we should .
And do we not invariably feel satisfied and refreshed after we have put forth the effort to study , to attend meetings , and to preach ? ​ — Psalm 1 : 1 , 2 ; 122 : 1 ; 145 : 10 - 13 .
“ I have come down from heaven to do , not my will , but the will of him that sent me , ” Jesus told his disciples .
When in anguish in the garden of Gethsemane , he prayed : “ My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me .
Instead , we should treasure what we have gained by choosing to be God’s slaves .
On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse , that I may gain Christ . ” ​ — Philippians 3 : 8 .
If Paul had continued to practice Judaism , he may well have risen to a position similar to that of Simeon , the son of Paul’s educator , Gamaliel .
Give an example to show how spiritual achievements bring rewards .
“ I enjoyed my work and earned good money , but in my heart I knew that I could do more to serve Jehovah .
They also show the extent to which we are willing to make personal sacrifices .
Paul wrote : “ If the readiness is there first , it is especially acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what a person does not have . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 8 : 12 .
“ You Are Having Your Fruit ”
Jehovah is generous to his slaves .
• Why do we become slaves of God ?
The provision of voluntary slavery in Israel was a foregleam of Christian servitude
[ Pictures on page 17 ]
Moses was reluctant to accept his assignment
Some three hundred years have elapsed since Joshua completed the conquest of the Promised Land .
The older men of Israel come to Jehovah’s prophet with a remarkable request .

We also meet two exemplary women and a valiant but gentle warrior .
Such examples provide valuable lessons about attitudes and actions to imitate and to avoid .
* Jehovah has answered her prayers , and she has given birth to a son .
Samuel now judges Israel , and there is peace in the land .
In his deathbed prophecy , Jacob said : “ The scepter [ a symbol of royal authority ] will not turn aside from Judah . ”
As such , he was not permitted to “ come in to see the holy things . ”
The expression “ where the ark of God was ” evidently refers to the tabernacle area .
7 : 7 - 9 , 17 ​ — Why did Samuel offer up a burnt offering at Mizpah and set up an altar in Ramah , since sacrifices were to be offered on a regular basis only at the place of Jehovah’s choosing ?
1 : 11 , 12 , 21 - 23 ; 2 : 19 .
He first asked depressed Hannah the unaccusing question : “ Why does your heart feel bad ? ”
Even an object as holy as the ark of the covenant did not prove to be a charm for protection .
Samuel follows Jehovah’s direction and anoints Saul , a handsome Benjamite , as king .
Saul’s valiant son Jonathan strikes down a Philistine garrison .
Taking along only his armor - bearer , courageous Jonathan attacks another Philistine outpost .
Upon defeating the Amalekites , though , he disobeys Jehovah by sparing what had been “ devoted to destruction . ”
14 : 24 - 32 , 44 , 45 ​ — Did Jonathan lose God’s favor for eating honey in violation of Saul’s oath ?
This act does not seem to have placed Jonathan in God’s disfavor .
First of all , Jonathan did not know about his father’s oath .
Moreover , the oath , prompted either by false zeal or by a wrong view of kingly power , caused problems for the people .
The Kenites were the sons of Moses ’ father - in - law .
In the land of Canaan , the Kenites also took up dwelling with the sons of Judah for a time .
What a protection such a mind - set is against irrational actions !
Never allow “ the unrealities , ” such as trust in men , confidence in the military might of nations , or idolatry , to turn you aside from serving Jehovah .
Samuel anoints David of the tribe of Judah to be the future king .
After three attacks by Saul , David flees and becomes a fugitive .
He also meets and eventually marries beautiful Abigail .
But Jehovah has left him .
Since God permitted that spirit to replace His holy spirit , this bad spirit is termed “ a bad spirit from Jehovah . ”
We also have the help of appointed Christian elders .
24 : 6 ; 26 : 11 .
In their efforts to misguide or harm people , wicked spirits can pretend to be certain dead individuals .
We must keep free from all forms of spiritism . ​ — Deuteronomy 18 : 10 - 12 .
This decision , based on Numbers 31 : 27 , shows that Jehovah values those who serve in supportive roles in the congregation .
What fundamental truth is emphasized by the experiences of Eli , Samuel , Saul , and David ?
[ Footnote ]
WHAT event is this ?
The occasion is also called “ the Lord’s evening meal , ” or “ the Lord’s supper . ”
Who benefit from Jesus ’ death ?
Parents , you well know that it is not because of any brilliance on your part that you have produced such a precious little bundle of life .
Parents often work long and hard to leave their children an inheritance .
They are a loving gift from him .
Instead , God chose to create humans with the ability to produce children who would resemble their parents in identifiable ways .
What a marvelous privilege it is for a mother and father to bring forth and care for such a new person !
Many show little compassion for their offspring .
He watched them at play in the marketplace and used aspects of their behavior in his teaching .
So when people brought little ones to see him , Jesus ’ disciples , perhaps in an effort to protect Jesus from further stress , tried to turn the children away .
Showing his “ fulness of delight ” with little ones , he said : “ Let the young children come to me ; do not try to stop them . ” ​ — Mark 10 : 13 , 14 .
We can learn from Jesus ’ example .
What children need , especially from their parents , is what Jesus was willing to give them ​ — his time and attention .
Patience is required .
How did Jesus teach his disciples a lesson on humility , and with what success at first ?
Jesus was aware of the ongoing competition for prominence among his disciples .
Instead of harshly reprimanding them , Jesus patiently provided an object lesson in an effort to teach them humility .
Did it produce the desired results ?
( a ) What customary task did Jesus ’ apostles fail to perform after arriving in an upper room with Jesus ?
( b ) What did Jesus do , and were his efforts successful at that time ?
The Bible says that later that evening “ there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them seemed to be greatest . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 24 .
How might parents imitate Jesus in their efforts to train their children ?
When your children fail to respond to your counsel , do you parents appreciate how Jesus must have felt ?
Parents , you do well to imitate Jesus ’ love and patience , never giving up in your efforts to train your children .
Jesus wanted to know what his disciples were thinking , so he listened when they had questions .
Can’t you see that I am busy ? ”
Parents must then make sure that it is discussed .
In this way the child will sense that the parent really is interested in him , and he will more readily confide in the parent .
Advocates claim that children do not need a lot of their parents ’ time as long as the limited time spent with them is meaningful , well - thought - out , and planned .
( b ) What do parents primarily need to teach young ones ?
Vital , too , is what is taught .
Evidently , they are the words that had just been mentioned , namely : “ You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force . ”
So the need to impart moral values to their children was impressed upon parents of old .
Note that parents are told how they are to teach “ these words , ” or commandments , to their young ones : “ You must inculcate them in your son . ”
The word “ inculcate ” means “ to teach and impress by frequent repetitions or admonitions : urge on or fix in the mind . ”
The Bible says : “ You must tie them [ “ these words , ” or commandments of God ] as a sign upon your hand , and they must serve as a frontlet band between your eyes ; and you must write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates . ”
This does not mean that parents should literally write God’s laws on doorposts and gates , tie a copy of them on the hands of their children , and place one between their eyes .
Why is it vital today that children be both taught and trained to protect themselves ?
What assistance is now available to parents to help them teach their children effectively ?
• What can parents and others learn from Jesus ?
The Bible calls such little ones “ an inheritance from Jehovah . ”
What was Manoah’s response upon learning that he was to become a father ?
Why is God’s help in rearing children especially needed today ?
Now more than ever before , parents need Jehovah’s help in rearing their children .
Satan the Devil and his angels have been hurled from heaven down to earth .
Lions usually prey on the most vulnerable , often the young .
( a ) Knowing that a lion is roaming in the neighborhood should prompt what reaction from parents ?
Satan is a predator .
He seeks to corrupt God’s people , thus making them unworthy of God’s approval .
Yet , some children do not obey .
“ Its ways are ways of pleasantness , ” the Bible says , “ and all its roadways are peace .
Often young ones act improperly , not because they have not been taught what is right , but because the teaching has not reached their heart ​ — their inner self .
He also tries to exploit their inherited sinful inclination to do bad things .
The child should learn that the course of wisdom is to obey God’s commandments . ​ — Proverbs 6 : 16 - 19 ; Hebrews 13 : 4 .
The complexity of the universe , the diversity of living things , the change of the seasons ​ — all such things can help a young child appreciate the existence of an all - wise Creator .
The kind of teaching that protects a child and motivates him to do what is right takes time , attention , and planning .
It requires that parents accept direction from God .
The Bible says : “ You , fathers , . . . go on bringing [ your children ] up in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah . ”
To instruct your child effectively , what is it important for you to know ?
Find out what is happening in your youngster’s life and what his or her views are .
Be very careful not to overreact .
Only if you reason with your children from the Scriptures so that they accept God’s viewpoint can it be said that you have put his mind in them .
When talking about sex , you might ask , “ Do you think that obeying Jehovah’s law not to have sexual relations before marriage will rob a person of happiness ? ”
Or do you think his laws are there to make us happy and to protect us ? ”
However , there is something else you can do .
You might ask , “ Why do you not want to hurt Jehovah ? ”
( b ) What good results have you had from using the book ?
( See also box on pages 18 - 19 . )
Then I remembered the chapter ‘ Obedience Protects You , ’ so I went back and told her I would be obedient to her . ”
“ Often my son will fix his eyes on a picture and not want the page turned , ” noted one appreciative mother .
Children need to know the proper and the improper use of their private body parts .
Yet , talking about this is not always easy .
A newspaper columnist observed that she grew up in an era in which using words that refer to the sexual organs was considered rude .
Informing children about sex does not take away their innocence , whereas failing to do so can lead to their being robbed of it .
How does the Teacher book help parents to teach their children about sex ?
Many letters have reported that such teaching is vital .
You will never regret it .
What a precious inheritance they are !
So treat them as such , as though you are answerable to God for how you rear them because the fact is , you are .

See chapter 40 , “ How to Make God Happy . ”
• What kind of teaching imparts wisdom ?
• What are vital issues to discuss with your children today ?
Thank you very much , from one who has served Jehovah since youth . ”
The questions and format are wonderful , and how fantastic to see sensitive issues dealt with , as in chapter 32 , ‘ How Jesus Was Protected . ’ ”
She concluded : “ Even though this book is no doubt primarily designed with the children of Jehovah’s Witnesses in mind , I imagine that teachers and others will be more than glad to have a copy too .
“ Wow ! What a wonderful book ! ”
exclaimed a woman from Maine , U.S.A .
It has reached into places I didn’t know were there and has stirred emotions and then soothed them , so that there was peace .
She concluded : “ I’m telling everyone , ‘ Please read it . ’ ”
He had so many questions that came from the book .

What lie is Ananias telling Peter ?

Sentiments expressed in this inspired song fit the spirit of Hezekiah , who “ kept sticking to Jehovah ” while serving as king of Judah .
Reflecting on experiences involving Jehovah’s servants past and present should enhance our appreciation for this divinely inspired song and increase our gratitude for God’s written Word , the Bible .
Jehovah will never leave us if we ‘ laud him with uprightness of heart and continue to keep his regulations . ’
That made him successful and enabled him to act wisely .
( a ) Show how it is possible to keep spiritually clean . ( b ) What help is there for a young person who has sinned seriously ?
This is so even if our parents have not set a good example .
As exiles in Babylon , Daniel and three other Hebrew youths ‘ kept on guard according to God’s word . ’
They did not habitually bleed slaughtered animals , and their eating unbled meat violated God’s law on blood .
Today , people in authority often try to force us to put human laws above the law of God .
When there is a conflict between the demands of man and the will of God , what will we do ?
Like Jesus Christ’s persecuted apostles , we will say : “ We must obey God as ruler rather than men . ” ​ — Acts 5 : 29 .
We can remain faithful to Jehovah even under the most trialsome circumstances .
Hezekiah , who may have written Psalm 119 , chose “ the way of faithfulness . ”
He did so even though he was surrounded by false worshipers and may have been ridiculed by members of the royal court .
Very likely , ‘ his soul was sleepless from grief ’ because of such circumstances .
Never would we want to view as desirable any worthless thing hated by God .
At times , we may be like Jesus ’ persecuted disciples , who prayed : “ Jehovah , . . . grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness . ”
The same Sovereign Lord gives us the courage to speak his word with boldness . ​ — Acts 4 : 24 - 31 .
For example , he witnessed to Roman Governor Felix , who “ listened to him on the belief in Christ Jesus . ”
God’s Word Gives Us Comfort
We may spend more time studying God’s written Word and may make greater effort to apply it .
God’s word gives us a sound basis for trust in Jehovah .
If we really trust in our Creator , we will have no reason for shame .
We can be sure that persecutors of God’s people really do not gain anything .
In Bible times , bottles made of animal hide were used to hold water , wine , and other liquids .
What have we considered in reviewing Psalm 119 : 1 - 88 , and what might we ask ourselves as we look forward to studying Psalm 119 : 89 - 176 ?
• On what does true happiness depend ?
• In what ways does God’s word impart courage and comfort ?
• Why should we have faith in Jehovah and his word ?
Paul courageously ‘ spoke about God’s reminders in front of kings ’
“ Your word is . . . a light to my roadway . ” ​ — PSALM 119 : 105 .
The psalmist would have ‘ perished in his affliction if he had not been fond of God’s law . ’
But this did not overwhelm him , for he loved God’s sustaining law .
We keep doing his will in loving unity with our brothers as we look forward to an eternity of joyous service to Jehovah . ​ — Psalm 119 : 93 .
Jehovah’s word imparts wisdom that can protect us from spiritual harm .
God’s commandments make us wiser than our enemies .
Yet , we must personally let Jehovah’s word be a lamp to our foot .
“ I have made a sworn statement , ” he said , “ and I will carry it out , to keep your [ Jehovah’s ] righteous judicial decisions . ”
9 , 10 .
King Solomon wandered , although he was a member of a nation dedicated to Jehovah and had originally acted in harmony with God - given wisdom .
For instance , a former associate may try to induce us to wander off the pathway of spiritual light into the darkness of apostasy .
If we never stray from his regulations , God will sustain us .
We do not approve of “ halfhearted ones , ” even as Jesus disapproves of lukewarm professing Christians today .
“ From the dread of you [ Jehovah ] my flesh has had a creepy feeling , ” said the psalmist .
Our having a wholesome dread of God , manifested by avoiding what he disapproves , is vital if he is to sustain us as his servants .
Moreover , ‘ we consider all of God’s orders regarding all things to be right . ’ ​ — Psalm 119 : 127 , 128 .
If we fear being defrauded , for instance , we might ask for God’s help in the way the psalmist did .
Then we might pray that Jehovah’s spirit help us to recall and apply his reminders .
Although we ‘ hate every false path , ’ we may need to ask God to act in our behalf so that we do not succumb to some temptation to break his law .
We are also grateful that Jehovah has ‘ made his face shine upon us ’ in approval , although ‘ streams of water run from our eyes ’ because others violate his law . ​ — Psalm 119 : 135 , 136 ; Numbers 6 : 25 .
We are sure to have God’s continued favor if we comply with his righteous reminders .
Since the psalmist obeyed God’s commandments , why did he say : “ I am insignificant and contemptible ” ?
What results from our observing God’s reminders ?
Because we pay attention to Jehovah’s reminders , we feel free to call upon him with our whole heart , and we can expect to be heard .
We may awaken “ early in the morning twilight ” and cry for help .
God is also near us because we avoid loose conduct and view his word as truth , even as Jesus did .
Because of our deep regard for God’s word , we enjoy true security .
If we always obey Jehovah , we will be privileged to keep on praising him .
For instance , it can make us more reliant on God , for it shows that true happiness results from “ walking in the law of Jehovah . ”
• Why are Jehovah’s people secure and at peace ?
[ Picture on page 17 ]
If we love Jehovah’s reminders , he will never regard us as “ scummy dross ”
“ I have hope toward God . . . that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous . ” ​ — ACTS 24 : 15 .
To show where he stood on that issue , Paul declared : “ Men , brothers , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees .
How did Paul prove to be a staunch advocate of the resurrection , and what can we learn from his example ?
In his defense Paul asked : “ Why is it judged unbelievable among you men that God raises up the dead ? ”
But what reaction can we expect ?
What was the reaction ?
Others , however , reacted favorably .
Yes , so fundamental is the teaching of the resurrection that the Christian faith is in vain if the resurrection is not accepted as a reality .
May our determination be to “ press on to maturity . ”
9 , 10 .
What does that expression involve ?
What resurrection prospects are offered to God’s anointed servants ?
The resurrection of Jesus and his anointed brothers provides them with a spirit body fit for service in heaven .
Under Jesus as High Priest , the anointed constitute a royal priesthood .
In the meantime , those of the anointed still alive on earth desire to remain acceptable to God .
At their death , they will receive their “ award ” through resurrection to immortal spirit life in heaven .
We can learn much from the example of Abraham .
His third reference focuses on the faith Abraham displayed when he obediently prepared to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice .
This was not a literal city like Jerusalem , which was the location of God’s temple .
It was God’s heavenly Kingdom made up of Christ Jesus and his 144,000 corulers .
In 1914 , Jehovah enthroned Jesus as Messianic King of the heavenly Kingdom and commanded him to rule in the midst of his enemies .
Likewise , for us to receive Kingdom blessings , we must be alive in God’s new world , either as members of the great crowd of Armageddon survivors or as those resurrected from the dead .
It foretells not only the crushing of Satan’s head but also , by contrast , the bruising in the heel of the Seed of God’s woman .
( b ) What will we review in the next article ?
We live deep in the time of the end and nearer the start of Christ’s Millennial Rule than when we first became believers .
We shall be , provided we stay close to Jehovah and obey his commands .
[ Picture on page 12 ]
Job drew comfort from the resurrection hope
Jesus was having a discussion with some Sadducees , who did not believe in the resurrection .
By saying these words , Jesus confirmed that from God’s viewpoint the long - dead Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob still lived in God’s memory .
Like Job , they await the end of their “ compulsory service , ” their sleep in death .
What , though , about the billions of others who have died throughout human history ?
Many religions teach that the dead are still alive , but as the inspired Word of God shows , those in Sheol are dead , without consciousness .
Following the apparent loss of his beloved son Joseph , the patriarch Jacob refused to take comfort , declaring : “ I shall go down mourning to my son into Sheol ! ”
Believing that his son was dead , Jacob desired to die and be in Sheol .
After that , Jacob resided in that land until his death at the very advanced age of 147 .
Explain . ( b ) What shows that others entered Sheol at their death ?
Who were these people ?
Peter here used the word “ Hades , ” the Greek counterpart of the Hebrew word “ Sheol . ”
Moses told the people to separate themselves from the ringleaders ​ — Korah , Dathan , and Abiram .
They would die violently .
David continued : “ Desolations be upon them !
He did not live on in God’s memory .
Their fall into sin was deliberate .
Interestingly , the last of these is named Death , and he is followed by Hades .
Thus , many who die an untimely death from the activity of the preceding horsemen end up in Hades , there to await a resurrection in God’s new world .
What , then , are the prospects for those in Sheol ( Hades ) and those in Gehenna ?
Those who will be corulers with Christ share in “ the first resurrection , ” but what hope is there for the rest of mankind ? ​ — Revelation 20 : 6 .
How do some benefit from “ a better resurrection ” ?
Do You Recall ?
• What are the prospects for those in Gehenna ?
• How will some benefit from “ a better resurrection ” ?
Our companion magazine , Awake ! , explained what happened .
“ In the afternoon , they set out together on a sight - seeing trip to Blackpool , a nearby seaside resort .
All 6 were among 12 people killed instantly in a motorway crash , described by the police as ‘ an absolute holocaust . ’ ”
Years earlier , in 1940 , an Austrian Witness named Franz was faced with the prospect of execution by guillotine for his refusal to be disloyal to Jehovah .
It was real to them .
Vision of the Earthly Resurrection
What does the vision recorded by the apostle John at Revelation 20 : 12 , 13 reveal ?
In a vision of events during the Millennial Reign of Christ Jesus , the apostle John saw the earthly resurrection taking place .
Rather , it relates to “ scrolls ” that are to be opened .
“ Resurrection of Life ” or “ Resurrection of Judgment ”
Earlier in John’s vision , Jesus is described as having “ the keys of death and of Hades . ”
He serves as Jehovah’s “ Chief Agent of life , ” empowered to judge “ the living and the dead . ”
How will he do this ?
He then added : “ Those who did good things to a resurrection of life , those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment . ”
( b ) How should this affect us ?
The resurrected Abraham will find great comfort in experiencing the reality of life under the rule of that “ city ” to which he looked forward .
Indeed , all who gain life in the righteous new world , whether by resurrection or by surviving the great tribulation , will have much to learn about Jehovah’s purpose for the earth and its inhabitants .
Will we apply what we learn ?
Those restored to life in the resurrection will not have the kind of infirmities or disabilities presently experienced .
What is the purpose of Satan’s release at the final test , and what outcome will be possible for us individually ?
Truly , theirs will be “ a resurrection of life . ” ​ — John 5 : 29 .
Do you see yourself in the new world , witnessing the resurrection ?
17 , 18 .
What inestimable privilege should we not forget ?
Above all , we should never forget the inestimable privilege of making Jehovah’s heart glad now and forever .
Then what joy it will be to live in the earthly Paradise either by surviving the great tribulation or by experiencing a miraculous resurrection !
How will Jehovah arrange matters for those who were married when they died ?
A host of other questions about the arrangements for the resurrection remain .
Nevertheless , we have to keep in mind the words of Jeremiah : “ Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him , to the soul that keeps seeking for him .
In Jehovah’s due time , all will be revealed to our fullest satisfaction .
Why can we be sure of this ?
Reflect on the psalmist’s inspired words when he sang of Jehovah : “ You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing . ”
Never overlook the fact that “ time and unforeseen occurrence ” befall us all .
• How can the resurrection hope comfort us now ?
Courage in the Face of Opposition
A FANATIC mob had forced Gaius and Aristarchus , two companions of the apostle Paul , to enter the theater of Ephesus .
The typical idol of Ephesus was a small silver shrine of Artemis , the goddess of fertility , whose magnificent temple overlooked the city .
These small representations of the temple were worn as amulets or were set up in homes .
Once the angry silversmiths began shouting the praises of Artemis , a veritable riot broke out and the whole city was thrown into confusion . ​ — Acts 19 : 24 - 29 .
And they likewise rejoice when they see that ‘ the word of Jehovah keeps growing and prevailing . ’ ​ — Acts 19 : 20 . [ Picture on page 30 ] Ruins of the theater at Ephesus
Erna’s colleagues at work denounced her for refusing to give the Hitler salute , and this led to her arrest by the Nazis .
Housekeeper With a Difference
At last Erna was free to practice her faith .

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
DOES recognizing Jehovah’s sovereignty require our perfect obedience ?
Does a man of integrity always do what is right in God’s eyes ?
What kind of individual does the true God find “ agreeable to his heart ” ?
* Completed in about 1040 B.C.E . , toward the end of David’s 40 - year kingship , the book is primarily about David and his relationship with Jehovah .
David goes on “ getting greater and greater , ” and some seven and a half years later , he is made king over all Israel . ​ — 2 Samuel 5 : 10 .
It is possible that Zeruiah was listed because she was David’s sister or half sister .
It seems reasonable to conclude that Ish - bosheth began his two - year - long kingship shortly after Saul’s death , about the same time David began his in Hebron .
2 : 1 ; 5 : 19 , 23 .
David inquired of Jehovah before taking up residence in Hebron and prior to going up against his enemies .
David’s lack of vindictiveness and ill will is exemplary .
We should never forget that Jehovah has educated us in his ways and made a good relationship with him possible .
In a trialsome situation , David first became angry , then afraid ​ — perhaps even blaming Jehovah for the tragedy .
A prophecy uttered some 400 years earlier is fulfilled .
9 : 1 , 6 , 7 .
Her full brother Absalom murders Amnon in revenge .
David returns to his kingship only after Absalom is killed .
Upon hearing Mephibosheth , David must have realized that he erred when he took Ziba’s words at face value .
Lessons for Us :
Having intelligence without humility and loyalty can be a snare .
Mephibosheth was truly appreciative of David’s loving - kindness .
The most widely accepted explanation is that these were the sons of Michal’s sister Merab , who married Adriel .
21 : 9 , 10 ​ — For how long did Rizpah keep up a vigil for her two sons and the five grandsons of Saul who were put to death by the Gibeonites ?
Their dead bodies were left exposed on a mountain .
24 : 10 .
Each time David erred , he acknowledged his sin , accepted discipline , and corrected his ways .
David was a man of integrity .

Bath - sheba
Amnon
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why did Moses react as he did when he saw an Egyptian mistreat a Hebrew ?
MOSES had been reared in the household of Pharaoh and had been educated in the wisdom esteemed by the nobility of Egypt .
Yet , Moses realized that he was not an Egyptian .
Moses chose to side with Jehovah’s people and thought that God was using him to provide deliverance for his brothers .
If Moses was to be used by God , he had to become better acquainted with Jehovah’s ways .
Israel’s older men initially believed Moses and Aaron .
With the Red Sea before them and war chariots behind them , the Israelites felt trapped , and they blamed Moses .
Though the Israelites had no boats , at Jehovah’s direction Moses urged the people to break camp .
Pharaoh proved to be both hardhearted and deceitful , yet Jehovah urged Moses to deliver messages to him again and again .
Israel was eager for deliverance .
What would you have done ?
Since then , the declaration of Jehovah’s name has benefited millions more who have taken up true worship .
Soon after Jehovah miraculously delivered the Israelites from Egypt , what happened when they did not quickly find suitable drinking water ?
Knowledge of Jehovah’s ways enables overseers to deal with situations in a manner that is in harmony with God’s Word and that is consistent with his personality .
Moses was to act in harmony with them .
The people of Israel needed to be reminded that when they entered into a covenant relationship with Jehovah , they vowed to obey him strictly .
They enjoyed much personal freedom , but in matters on which Jehovah had given them commandments , they had to be strictly obedient .
Give priority to spiritual matters .
Take time to meditate on those words .
How did Jehovah demonstrate it ?
Or do research on that subject with the use of the Watch Tower Publications Index or the computer program Watchtower Library ( CD - ROM ) .
* Use a concordance to find scriptures referring to mercy .
You will see that in addition to allowing for a lightening of punishment at times , Jehovah’s mercy includes tender compassion .
It moves God to take action to bring his people relief .
How much more so should his present - day servants show compassion to one another ! ​ — Matthew 9 : 13 ; 18 : 21 - 35 .
Jehovah’s mercy is coupled with graciousness .
The Bible shows that graciousness on Jehovah’s part includes loving concern for disadvantaged ones among his people .
What about us as God’s people today ?
Graciousness on our part helps to unite us and to attract others to the worship of Jehovah . ​ — Acts 10 : 34 , 35 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 .
Kind concern for people of other nations , however , was not to override Israel’s love for Jehovah and his moral standards .
So that Moses would understand His ways , Jehovah made it clear that although he does not approve of sin , he is slow to anger .
Having appreciation for Jehovah’s ways can safeguard God’s people from blaming God for situations that they have brought on themselves or from concluding that he is slow .
• Why was meekness important for Moses , and why is it vital for us ?
• How can we deepen our understanding of Jehovah’s qualities ?
[ Picture on page 21 ]

HOW do you react when you are confronted by those who are not favorably disposed toward you or toward what you represent ?
What scriptures can help us to deal wisely with people who speak harshly to us ?
Extreme hardship or frustration may cause people to lash out at whoever is around them .
It will be reflected in what we say and do , perhaps also in our facial expression and in our tone of voice .
In many cases , it is possible to say , “ I was hoping to read just this one brief text from the Bible . ”
Insolent but Misguided
There is no evidence that the disciples tried to engage Saul in public debate while he was conducting himself in that manner .
He was a Pharisee , educated “ according to the strictness of the ancestral Law . ”
After that , Caiaphas saw to it that the apostles of Jesus were flogged , and he sternly ordered them to quit preaching on the basis of Jesus ’ name .
But Saul came to his senses when the resurrected Jesus miraculously spoke to him on the road to Damascus . ​ — Acts 9 : 3 - 6 .
What happened to Saul as a result of his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus ?
He came to be known as the apostle Paul , a zealous Christian missionary .
Mild - Tempered but Courageous
In dealing with sinners , Jesus took note when there was evidence of a change for the better , and he encouraged such individuals .
Rather than judging others on the basis of outward appearances , Jesus imitated his Father’s kindness , forbearance , and long - suffering with a view to leading them to repentance .
Giving Jehovah’s view of Jesus Christ , the Gospel writer Matthew quotes these prophetic words : “ Look !
I will put my spirit upon him , and what justice is he will make clear to the nations .
He will not wrangle , nor cry aloud , nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways .
No bruised reed will he crush , and no smoldering flaxen wick will he extinguish , until he sends out justice with success .
10 , 11 . ( a ) Although Pharisees were among Jesus ’ most vocal opposers , why did he witness to some of them ?
Though some of them endeavored to trap him in his speech , Jesus did not conclude that all of them had bad motives .
On another occasion , a prominent Pharisee named Nicodemus came to Jesus under cover of night .
Jesus also kindly pointed out the importance of obedience to God’s arrangement .
Nicodemus later spoke up in behalf of Jesus when a favorable report about Jesus was belittled by other Pharisees . ​ — John 7 : 46 - 51 .
Jesus was not blind to the hypocrisy of those who were trying to entrap him .
Even when he was shouted at , how was Jesus able to help people ?
When that happened , he exercised restraint and even used his God - given power to bring relief .
Within the Family
Why do people sometimes oppose a family member who begins to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
The need for Jesus ’ followers to exercise restraint often becomes most evident within the family .
But as Jesus said , family members may show hostility .
A family member who feels that his influence in the family is somehow being diminished because of our loyalty to Jehovah may take offense .
14 - 16 .
The opposers may have heard negative comments about Jehovah’s Witnesses , and perhaps they feared that there would be an undesirable influence on the household .
An opposer may also have refused to listen to any explanation from the Bible because of prejudice or pride .
Another time , he left home with a gun and threatened to kill himself .
In Albania a woman became angry because her daughter studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and then got baptized .
In one instance , a knife - wielding husband confronted his wife , hurling bitter accusations at her as she approached the Kingdom Hall .
She gently replied : “ Come into the Kingdom Hall , and see for yourself . ”
It is noteworthy that Christians in ancient Ephesus were counseled : “ Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness . ”
What would help them to change ?
They would learn to “ become kind to one another , tenderly compassionate , freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave [ them ] . ”
Because they did not fully discern the objective of the Mosaic Law , they failed to appreciate the importance of faith , love , and a good conscience .
May we earnestly petition Jehovah for help so that we can exercise restraint and represent him properly , even under difficult circumstances .
• When you are confronted with insolent speech , what scriptures can help you ?
• Why did Saul act in an insolent manner ?
In spite of Saul’s reputation , Ananias treated him with kindness
A Christian’s faithfully caring for responsibilities can soften family opposition
Part of the answer is reflected in the comments of one of the prime ministers who attended the APEC conference .
He said , “ There is this thing called national pride . ”
National sovereignty combined with the spirit of competition and greed has produced a volatile mix .
In one case after another , when national interests conflict with global interests , national interests win out .
Nationalism is well described by the psalmist’s expression , “ the pestilence causing adversities . ”
God’s Word , the Bible , correctly describes the result of all human rule , saying : “ Man has dominated man to his injury . ”
Our Creator , who knows what is best for us , never purposed for humans to set up their own governments and rule themselves .
Psalm 95 : 3 - 5 says : “ Jehovah is a great God and a great King over all other gods , he in whose hand are the inmost depths of the earth and to whom the peaks of the mountains belong ; to whom the sea , which he himself made , belongs and whose own hands formed the dry land itself . ”
God is the rightful Sovereign to whom all should look for rulership .
For example , many commentators , including religious leaders , have urged people to look to the United Nations for world unity .
The nations tenaciously hang on to their own perceived right to sovereignty .
Whether they realize it or not , the nations are now on a march that will lead to a collision with God .
The last book of the Bible speaks of “ the kings of the entire inhabited earth ” being gathered together “ to the war of the great day of God the Almighty . ”
The nations and their divisive ways will be put out of existence .
As the Universal Sovereign , Jehovah God through his Son will wisely exert the power to make the changes necessary for a united world .
Why not take a few minutes to read Psalm 72 in your Bible ?
But it would be a mistake to think so .
Would you like to see this change ?

KING DAVID of ancient Israel “ earnestly hoped in Jehovah ” and was moved to say that Jehovah “ inclined his ear to [ him ] and heard [ his ] cry for help . ”
His future is thus assured in the best possible way .
Although the faithful ones mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11 lived before the earthly sojourn of Jesus Christ , they nevertheless lived in harmony with what Jesus taught when he said : “ He that is fond of his soul destroys it , but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life . ”
In response , Jehovah gave Jesus the strength to maintain integrity .
What assurance is given to anointed Christians and to the “ other sheep ” ?
Meanwhile , they treasure their personal friendship with God and sincerely strive to strengthen that relationship .
One way in which Jehovah safeguards the spiritual welfare of his people is by providing a program of progressive training .
Under the direction of “ the faithful and discreet slave , ” God’s people around the world are like an international family .
The slave class looks after the spiritual needs and when necessary even the physical needs of the family of Jehovah’s servants ​ — irrespective of their national origin or social standing . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 .
For example , we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from many heartbreaking problems if we avoid drug and alcohol abuse , sexual promiscuity , and a violent life - style .
Safeguarded by Thinking Ability , Discernment , and Wisdom
Doing so enables us to develop greater discernment so that we can set proper priorities .
This is vital , since most of us know ​ — possibly through personal experience — ​ that problems arise when people either purposely or unintentionally set unwise priorities .
As a result , a person can be left with nothing more than the sad reality indicated by Jesus ’ words : “ Of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul ? ”
13 , 14 .
What does it mean to be self - centered , and why is it unwise to become so ?
Humans are by nature interested in themselves .
Therefore , to safeguard our friendship with him , Jehovah instructs us to avoid being self - centered .
People in general may view this as impractical , yet it is vital if we are to enjoy successful marriages , happy family relationships , and satisfying friendships .
First and foremost , this means the interests of Jehovah , the God he worships .
He voiced his indignation by arguing : “ Why was it this perfumed oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor people ? ”
Regrettably , some early Christians , while they were not thieves like Judas , did fall victim to pride , becoming self - assuming .
How does Jehovah feel about pride ?
Soon all of Satan’s world , together with its proud , self - important leaders , visible and invisible , will also be called to account .
We can also be assured that when the great tribulation strikes , Jehovah will safeguard his people not only spiritually but also physically .
In what ways are God’s people safeguarded spiritually today ?
Saved , Not by Works Alone , But by Undeserved Kindness
How do Christians differ from people in general as regards personal accomplishments , and why ?
While they rejoice over what Jehovah’s people accomplish as a whole , they keep their individual contribution in the background .
Of what did Paul boast , and why ?
The apostle Paul was well - aware of this fact .
Humbly accepting Jehovah’s decision , Paul said : “ Most gladly , therefore , will I rather boast as respects my weaknesses , that the power of the Christ may like a tent remain over me . ”
With modesty , he noted : “ To me , a man less than the least of all holy ones , this undeserved kindness was given , that I should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the Christ . ”
No boastful attitude here nor holier - than - thou haughtiness .
“ Considering That the Others Are Superior ”
Why may we sometimes find it difficult to consider others to be superior to us ?
Perhaps the difficulty arises because we have been influenced , to a certain extent , by the spirit of competition so prevalent in the world today .
Possibly , as children we were taught to compete , either with our siblings at home or with our classmates at school .
We were perhaps constantly urged to reach out for the honor of being the school’s star athlete or its top student .
To justify his actions , he may start to murmur and become critical of others ​ — tendencies that Christians should shun .
If that is true of secular pursuits , how much more it is true in the realm of worship !
8 , 9 . ( a ) Why do Christian elders have no reason to compete with one another ?
They thus ward off disruptive competition and set a fine example in unity for the rest of the congregation .
As a result , elders have different responsibilities in Jehovah’s organization .
Instead of making comparisons , they bear in mind the counsel : “ In proportion as each one has received a gift , use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways . ”
In reality , this text applies to all of Jehovah’s servants , for to some extent all have received the gift of accurate knowledge and all enjoy the privilege of sharing in the Christian ministry .
It is therefore vital to have a balanced view of our activity in support of true worship .
As long as we perform our ministry with the right motive , is it really necessary to keep account of what we do or how much ?
( b ) What reasons do we have for joy when viewing the overall report of our preaching activity ?
News of growth and expansion earth wide fills us with joy , moves us to greater activity , and assures us of Jehovah’s blessing .
Besides preaching and teaching , what is included in our worship of Jehovah ?
Of course , much of what every Witness does in fulfilling his responsibility as a dedicated servant of Jehovah does not appear on his report .
Though works alone cannot save us , why are they necessary ?
Jehovah is reasonable in what he expects of us .
Continuing in “ prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving , ” we will petition God to help us do our utmost .
Can You Explain Why Christians
• avoid judging fellow Christians ?
The parents carry the heaviest load , making sure that everyone is clean , fed , and ready on time .
Even careful parental planning may go awry .
Yet , the family is nearly always at the Kingdom Hall well before the meeting starts .
How encouraging it is to see them there week after week , year after year , as the children grow up to serve Jehovah !
Jehovah is the Originator of the family arrangement .
Let us review three ways in which God expects parents to provide .
Of course , it is ideal for a family to have both parents , with the father taking the lead .
In today’s world , there are many obstacles a family head may face in order to provide in that way .
A Christian would do his utmost to avoid such a standing before his God .
Family heads may also find it helpful to contemplate Jesus ’ perfect example .
The Bible says of him : “ By this we have come to know love , because that one surrendered his soul for us . ”
However , he also on a day - to - day basis put the needs of others ahead of his own in smaller ways .
Jesus here painted a vivid word picture of a mother hen sheltering her young with her wings .
Truly , parents may learn much from the protective instincts of a mother bird , who will readily put herself at risk to protect her chicks from harm .
Even more essential than providing materially is providing spiritually .
What can you parents do to provide spiritually ?
Please open your Bible and read those verses .
How may parents imitate Jesus ’ example when it comes to inculcating Bible truths in their children ?
To “ inculcate ” means to teach and impress by means of repetition .
For example , when teaching his disciples to be humble instead of proud and competitive , he found a variety of ways to repeat the same principle .
As Deuteronomy 6 : 7 shows , there are many occasions when you parents can discuss spiritual things with your children .
Such conversations may move young ones to read more of the literature provided by the faithful and discreet slave class . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 - 47 .
For example , you might ask : “ Wouldn’t it be wonderful if more people knew this about Jehovah ?
Jesus taught his disciples how to pray , and he prayed with them on many occasions .
Similarly , your children can learn a lot from your prayers .
For example , younger women are exhorted “ to love their children . ”
Their doing so is related to young mothers ’ being recalled to their senses , or being “ mentally sound . ”
It causes great pain and represents a failure to imitate Jehovah , who shows us immense love despite our imperfections . ​ — Psalm 103 : 8 - 14 .
Why is discipline important , and what balance do Christian parents strive to find ?
Such balance is not always easy for imperfect parents to find .
You thereby give your children the best possible opportunity to “ choose life ” and thereafter to “ keep alive . ”
Those children who choose to serve Jehovah and stay on the path to life as they mature bring their parents tremendous joy .
What can parents do in order to provide for their children
• materially ?

There is a work going on today that is far more important than any other privilege you might be waiting for .
Jehovah invites young ones to have what privilege , and what questions will we now consider ?
Just imagine : If you approached a large group of people who in unison were singing a beautiful , moving song , how would you feel ?
Many of the praisers described in Psalm 148 can neither speak nor reason .
For example , we read of the sun , moon , stars , snow , wind , mountains , and hills praising Jehovah .
All that Jehovah has made reminds us that he is the almighty Creator , that there is no one in all the universe so powerful , so wise , or so loving . ​ — Romans 1 : 20 ; Revelation 4 : 11 .
In Ps 148 verse 2 , we find Jehovah’s celestial “ army , ” the angels , praising God .
8 , 9 .
Consider two reasons .
To see us filling that need pleases Jehovah , much the way it pleases your parents to see you eating food that they know is good for you . ​ — John 4 : 34 .
Well , Jehovah is widely slandered in this world .
What Bible examples show that young people can be very effective in praising Jehovah ?
She boldly witnessed to her mistress about Jehovah’s prophet Elisha .
Of all the events of his youth that could have been recorded in the Scriptures , Jehovah chose one , the occasion when 12 - year - old Jesus courageously questioned the religious teachers at the temple in Jerusalem and left them astounded at his understanding of Jehovah’s ways . ​ — Luke 2 : 46 - 49 .
As a grown man , Jesus also inspired children to praise Jehovah .
Everyone there , especially the religious leaders , should have been moved to praise Jehovah and his Son , the Messiah .
Do you know who they were ?
Did you never read this , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise ’ ? ”
They often have the gift of seeing the truth clearly and simply , expressing their faith with earnestness and zeal .
Remember , the greatest of all the commandments is this : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ”
Once your motive is clear and strong , you are ready to praise Jehovah enthusiastically .
Years later , that young sister was serving as a regular pioneer , a full - time minister .
What might a young person do if he is hesitant to strike up conversations about the Bible and Jehovah God ?
However , you can make it more likely that others will ask you about your faith .
As the experiences on page 29 show , many young people are praising God in school .
If you are not yet taking part , why not set it as a goal ?
For example , rather than saying essentially the same thing at each door , look for ways to improve , asking your parents and other experienced ones for pointers .
Learn how to use the Bible more , to make effective return visits , and to start a Bible study .
You would not be the first to feel that way .
Young Jeremiah , for instance , told Jehovah : “ Alas , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah !
Note these inspired words that the psalmist addressed to Jehovah : “ Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force .
In the splendors of holiness , from the womb of the dawn , you have your company of young men just like dewdrops . ” ​ — Psalm 110 : 3 .
Clearly , your choice to praise Jehovah makes his heart rejoice .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Pictures on page 25 ]
If your friend had an outstanding skill , would you not mention this to others ?
Other animals follow a similarly predictable pattern .
Our being formed “ in God’s image ” means that even though we have been tarnished by sin and imperfection , we have the ability to mirror certain qualities of God .
Our spiritual capacity is most clearly demonstrated in our innate desire to worship God .
By comparing our beliefs with God’s Word , we imitate the people of ancient Beroea , who made sure that Paul’s teachings harmonized with the Scriptures .
They “ received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind , ” he wrote , “ carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so . ”
Then your peace would become just like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea . ”
All who love goodness and righteousness would surely be moved by such a warm appeal !
God made that heartfelt appeal to the Israelites because they were being misled by religious lies .
Among Jehovah’s Witnesses are many individuals who used to be drug addicts , drunkards , fornicators , street fighters , thieves , and liars .
Yet , they took God’s Word to heart and with the help of holy spirit made changes in their lives so as to “ walk worthily of Jehovah . ”
Having made peace with God , they also gained inner peace and , as we shall see , a genuine hope for the future .
The Bible hope of lasting peace for obedient humans will be fulfilled through the Kingdom of God .
Because that heavenly Kingdom ​ — a government in the hands of Jesus Christ — ​ is God’s means of expressing His rightful sovereignty over the earth . ​ — Psalm 2 : 7 - 12 ; Daniel 7 : 13 , 14 .
Says Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 : “ Look !
Lasting peace will prevail earth wide .
So Albert decided to listen in on a Bible discussion to point out any errors .
He later explained why his attitude had changed .
“ This was what I had always been looking for , ” he said .
How can his death benefit you ?

□ What are God’s standards of morality ?

[ Picture on page 5 ] “ They will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 4 : 3
[ Picture on page 7 ]
They turn on the radio and hear frightening reports about deadly diseases stalking the earth .
The Bible makes a connection between love for God and the ministry , for it states : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments . ”
Yes .
Jesus explained : “ I do nothing of my own initiative ; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things . ”
Look , for example , at what is described in Mark chapter 6 .
The apostles return from a preaching campaign and relate to Jesus all that they have done and taught .
Jesus notices that the apostles are tired , and he tells them to come with him to “ rest up a bit . ”
What does Jesus do ?
Pity moves Jesus to continue sharing the good news in spite of his tiredness .
Our Message ​ — The Good News of God’s Kingdom
The key expression in that scripture , “ your God has become king , ” reminds us of the message that we must proclaim , namely , the good news of God’s Kingdom .
Note , too , that this verse reveals the positive tenor of our message .
In modern times , especially since 1919 , Jehovah’s Witnesses have followed Jesus ’ example by zealously proclaiming the good news of God’s established Kingdom and the blessings it will bring .
How does the prophet Isaiah describe the immediate blessings that come to those who accept the good news ?
In addition , the good news we preach brings immediate relief and blessings to those who listen to it .
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to those taken captive and the wide opening of the eyes even to the prisoners ; to proclaim the year of goodwill on the part of Jehovah and the day of vengeance on the part of our God ; to comfort all the mourning ones . ” ​ — Isaiah 61 : 1 , 2 ; Luke 4 : 16 - 21 .
According to that prophecy , by preaching the good news , Jesus would “ bind up the brokenhearted . ”
And by supporting those in need , they reflect Jehovah’s concern .
The psalmist states concerning God : “ He is healing the brokenhearted ones , and is binding up their painful spots . ” ​ — Psalm 147 : 3 .
How the Kingdom Message Makes a Difference
15 , 16 .
* At first , the depressed woman listened to the reading while lying in bed with her eyes closed , from time to time heaving sighs .
Some time later , she was sitting in a chair in the living room , waiting for her Bible teacher to come .
Take as an example Maria from Western Europe .
( a ) How is the Kingdom message making a difference in the lives of those who accept it ?
How was Paul affected by the Jews ’ rejection of the good news , and why ?
In the same way that it did the apostle Paul .
He often preached to Jews , but most of them rejected the message of salvation .
( a ) Why is it understandable that we may feel discouraged at times ?
( b ) What helped Paul to continue in his preaching work ?
His hope was that there were still some who would accept Christ .
20 , 21 . ( a ) Regarding our ministry , how can we follow Paul’s example ?
Today , we follow Paul’s example .
However , to reach as many individuals as possible with the Kingdom message , we need to pay attention not only to why and what we preach but also to how we preach .

• What blessings are experienced by those who accept the Kingdom message ?
[ Pictures on page 18 ]
When we adapt our preaching methods , whom are we imitating ?
To “ the Ends of the Earth ”
( a ) What challenge do we face in our preaching work ?
A major challenge faced by those preaching the good news is the extent of the territory ​ — “ all the inhabited earth . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) Who have played a significant role in spreading the good news ?
It is a blessing to have them with us . ”
Today , that number has risen to over 400 .
“ The faithful and discreet slave ” has spared no effort in providing literature even for some whose language is spoken by relatively few people .
For example , Bible literature is now available in Greenlandic ( spoken by 47,000 people ) , Palauan ( spoken by 15,000 ) , and Yapese ( spoken by fewer than 7,000 people ) .
For instance , in Paris , France , some 100 different languages are spoken .
In a recent year , nearly 40 percent of all those baptized at the district conventions in one Western European country had come from another land .
In response , Jesus said that one outstanding feature of that sign would be a global preaching work .
He said : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ”
Jordy , a young Witness in Western Europe , noted : “ To know that I am used by Jehovah to play a part in fulfilling Matthew 24 : 14 makes me very happy . ”
Jesus forewarned his followers : “ You will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name . ”
In some lands , they are at present the target of governmental bans .
Still , in obedience to God , true Christians in such lands continue preaching the Kingdom good news .
What enables them , as well as all other Witnesses worldwide , to do so ?
The order of events in this scripture is significant .
First , the disciples received the holy spirit , and then they undertook the global witnessing work .
( b ) What methods did Saul use to persecute David ?
Afterward , Saul listened to his son Jonathan , David’s friend , and swore : “ As Jehovah is living , [ David ] will not be put to death . ”
No one can stop that from taking place . ​ — Acts 5 : 40 , 42 .
What can earthling man do to me ? ”
I am also touched by the many expressions of gratitude from local Witnesses who often thank me for coming to help them . ”
“ However , we persevered in our assignment , and seven of our Bible students now attend the meetings . ”

Highlights From the Book of First Kings
“ WHEN the righteous become many , the people rejoice ; but when anyone wicked bears rule , the people sigh . ”
It relates the life story of Solomon , during whose kingship ancient Israel enjoys a time of security and great prosperity .
First Kings also includes an account of the dividing of the nation after Solomon’s death and of 14 kings who followed him , some in Israel and some in Judah .
Among the building projects Solomon completes are Jehovah’s temple and various government buildings .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
1 : 5 ​ — Why did Adonijah try to seize the throne while David was still alive ?
However , Adonijah did not invite Solomon and others loyal to David to “ a sacrifice . ”
Even though Bath - sheba had failed to recognize it , Solomon discerned the true intention behind Adonijah’s request that she ask the king to give him Abishag as a wife .
Whatever the case , Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift .
11 : 4 ​ — Did senility cause Solomon to become unfaithful in his old age ?
This does not seem to be the case .
Moreover , he did not completely leave off following Jehovah .
He apparently tried to practice some form of interfaith .
8 : 22 - 53 .
What heartfelt appreciation Solomon expressed for Jehovah ​ — a God of loving - kindness , the Fulfiller of promises , and the Hearer of prayer !
King Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam because of what Ahijah had prophesied concerning Jeroboam .
Instead of granting their request , Rehoboam threatens to place an even heavier load on them .
Among the kings who rule in Israel after Jeroboam are Nadab , Baasha , Elah , Zimri , Tibni , Omri , Ahab , and Ahaziah .
It was only after Jehovah demonstrated his power that they said : “ Jehovah is the true God ! Jehovah is the true God ! ” ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 39 .
Instead of striking Ben - hadad down , Ahab concluded a covenant with him by which streets in the Syrian capital , Damascus , would be assigned to Ahab , evidently for the establishment of bazaars , or markets .
When making vital decisions in life , we should seek the advice of wise and mature individuals who are knowledgeable in the Scriptures and have high regard for godly principles .
The widow of Zarephath recognized Elijah as a prophet and received him as such , and Jehovah blessed her acts of faith .
Today , Jehovah also notices our acts of faith , and he rewards those who support the Kingdom work in various ways . ​ — Matthew 6 : 33 ; 10 : 41 , 42 ; Hebrews 6 : 10 .
19 : 1 - 8 .
Jehovah is not a nature god or a mere personification of natural forces .
20 : 11 .
When faced with a new task , we must avoid the overconfidence of a braggart . ​ — Proverbs 27 : 1 ; James 4 : 13 - 16 .
How clearly this vital truth is brought to our attention in the book of First Kings !
[ Picture on page 29 ]
The temple and other buildings constructed by Solomon
A MAN traveling through the countryside comes to a fork in the road .
Such uncertainty can interfere with our ability to make decisions , causing us to be unsure of the way in which to walk .
A situation arose that could have had such an effect on some people in the Christian congregation in first - century Corinth , Greece .
3 , 4 .
What standard do we have for testing whether we are in the faith , and why is that the ideal standard ?
Yes , God’s word can test our heart ​ — what we really are on the inside .
“ The law of Jehovah ” is found in God’s written Word , the Bible .
We can be glad that we have much help to understand God’s Word .
Jehovah has provided teachings and instruction through the publications of “ the faithful and discreet slave , ” which explain the Scriptures .
* What fine opportunities for personal reflection this feature of the book provides !
Numerous subjects discussed in our journals , The Watchtower and Awake ! , also help us to test whether we are in the faith .
They help me examine whether my speech , conduct , and attitude really measure up to Jehovah’s righteous standards . ”
Should we not strive to maintain a positive , spiritual view of what we read in our books , magazines , and other publications and of what we hear at our meetings and from the elders ?
What does proving what we ourselves are involve ?
Just as certain muscles in the body of an athlete need to be trained through repeated use before he can excel at his sport , our perceptive powers have to be trained through use in applying Bible principles .
When we regularly engage in personal study ​ — especially of the deeper things of God’s Word — ​ our perceptive powers are improved .
Using a powerful illustration to describe this area of self - evaluation , the disciple James says : “ Become doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves with false reasoning .
For if anyone is a hearer of the word , and not a doer , this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror . For he looks at himself , and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is .
James is saying : ‘ Peer into the mirror of God’s word , and evaluate yourself .
Then , do not quickly forget what you have seen .
Following this advice may at times present a challenge .
Why does following James ’ counsel present a challenge ?
Take , for example , the requirement to share in the Kingdom - preaching work . “ With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness , ” wrote Paul , “ but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation . ”
Participating in the preaching work does not come naturally to most of us .
But once we become doers of this God - given work , we are happy because of the praise that it brings to Jehovah .
What should our works of faith include ?
Proof of what we are is given by our practicing what we have learned , accepted , heard , and seen ​ — the full scope of Christian dedication and discipleship . “ This is the way .
Walk in it , ” instructs Jehovah through the prophet Isaiah . ​ — Isaiah 30 : 21 .
What type of individuals are a great blessing to the congregation ?
Men and women who are diligent students of God’s Word , who are zealous preachers of the good news , who are flawless in their integrity , and who are loyal supporters of the Kingdom are a great blessing to the congregation .
Their presence adds stability to the congregation they associate with .
When we take to heart Paul’s advice to ‘ keep testing whether we are in the faith , keep proving what we ourselves are , ’ we too become a good influence on others .
When God’s law is within our inward parts , we are not unsure of the way in which to walk .

We prove what we are by becoming ‘ not forgetful hearers , but doers of the word ’
Are You Faithful in All Things ?
Jehovah God , on the other hand , does not change with time .
Jehovah is constant and dependable , even in the minutest details .
( a ) Why should we examine ourselves to determine whether we are faithful ?
What determines whether we are faithful ?
In the construction and setting up of the tabernacle , “ Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him .
This certainly includes our remaining loyal to Jehovah while facing difficult tests or severe trials .
Obedience each day in “ what is least ” is important for two reasons .
The provisions of the Babylonian king , however , presented a challenge to the four Hebrew youths .
The slaughtered animals may not have been bled properly , and partaking of such meat would have violated God’s Law .
This was an issue that touched on their loyalty and faithfulness to God .
Proving faithful in what might have seemed less significant prepared Daniel’s three friends to cope with a greater trial .
When brought before the king , they declared their determination with confidence : “ If it is to be , our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us . Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand , O king , he will rescue us .
What is the context of Jesus ’ words recorded at Luke 16 : 10 ?
How can we demonstrate faithfulness in our use of “ unrighteous riches ” ?
We show faithfulness by exercising wisdom in the way we use our material possessions .
Rather than using them for selfish purposes , we want to use them in furthering Kingdom interests and in helping those in need .
By being faithful in this way , we make friends with Jehovah God and Jesus Christ , the possessors of “ the everlasting dwelling places . ”
Though the original application of Luke 16 : 10 concerns the use of material resources , the principle stated there also applies in other areas of life .
We pay our debts and our taxes promptly and honestly .
Why ?
At times , Jehovah’s Witnesses are offered promotions because employers observe their honesty and hard work . ​ — Proverbs 10 : 4 .
Faithfulness in Our Christian Ministry
14 , 15 .
How do we show faithfulness in the ministry that is entrusted to us ?
Why should we allow a month to pass without witnessing about Jehovah and his purpose ?
Another fine way to show faithfulness in the field service is to apply the suggestions found in The Watchtower and Our Kingdom Ministry .
Keeping Separate From the World
If we are not careful , for instance , how easily our manner of dress can become undignified and inappropriate !
This serves as a witness to others who observe us .
Even the angels take note of our activity , as they did of that of Paul and his Christian associates .
Blessings for Faithfulness
True Christians are spoken of as “ fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways . ”
• How can we prove faithful
A fine way to show faithfulness is to prepare well for the field ministry
[ Picture on page 30 ]
Simone too looks back on her youth and says , “ Deep within me there was a void and the belief that I wasn’t worth much . ”
People who feel that way are often victims of what the Bible calls their own “ disquieting thoughts . ”
Believing that they are unworthy of happiness , many fall into self - destructive behavior that they feel powerless to correct .
Can anything be done to combat such feelings ?
The Bible sets out principles and practical advice that have helped many to succeed in the struggle .
The Bible Can Help You Find Joy
Rather , our aim should be to cultivate a reasonable view of ourselves , one that takes into consideration our strengths as well as our limitations .
A Christian woman put it this way : “ I’m not the epitome of evil ; nor am I God’s gift to others .
Actually , this is what God’s Word urges us to do .
Bible Principles That Promote Joy
When the psalmist urges us to throw our burden on Jehovah , he is in effect reminding us that Jehovah not only cares about us but also views us as individuals worthy of his help and support .
When we help others and see their appreciative response , we feel better about ourselves .
“ First , it gives me the kind of happiness and satisfaction Jesus spoke of , ” she says .
I also try to surround myself with positive people , and I try to be there for others . ”
“ Talking things out helps a lot , ” admits Simone .
Often just getting it out is all that’s needed . ”
Doing so will help you experience the truthfulness of the proverb that says : “ Anxious care in the heart of a man is what will cause it to bow down , but the good word is what makes it rejoice . ” ​ — Proverbs 12 : 25 .
We have considered but a few of the many wonderful and practical principles from the Bible that can help us overcome negative feelings and find true joy .
It is our sincere hope that with guidance from God’s Word , you will be able to find true joy in all that you do .

Jehovah Has Numbered “ the Very Hairs of Your Head ”
( b ) Did Job’s expressions mean that he had turned against Jehovah ?
He did not know that Satan was the cause of his trials , so he mistakenly concluded that God had left him .
When adversities strike , what might come to our mind ?
Does he care about me as an individual ? ’
Consider what happened to the apostle Paul .
However , he urged them : “ Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul ; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna . ” ​ — Matthew 10 : 1 , 16 - 22 , 28 .
7 , 8 . ( a ) How were sparrows viewed in Jesus ’ day ?
Consider first the matter of the sparrows .
In Jesus ’ day , sparrows were used for food , but because they were a threat to crops , they were largely viewed as pests .
Sparrows were so abundant and cheap that two could be purchased for less than the equivalent of five cents in modern values .
Jesus evidently wanted his apostles to imagine a bird of the very least significance .
What powerful point is made by Jesus ’ illustration of the sparrows ?
For the most part , one hair seems just like the next , and no single hair seems to deserve our particular scrutiny .
“ Put My Tears in Your Skin Bottle ”
What shows that Jehovah truly feels for his servants ?
King David’s conviction that Jehovah cared for him and felt for him is made evident in Psalm 56 , which David composed while running from murderous King Saul .
Then , as recorded at Psalm 56 : 8 , David makes these intriguing statements : “ My being a fugitive you yourself have reported . Do put my tears in your skin bottle .
When we are under stress , we may cry out to Jehovah with tears .
Becoming an Intimate Companion of God
Why , the very idea seems beyond comprehension for imperfect humans !
Yet , Jehovah invites those who fear him to be guests in his tent .
And what does Jehovah do for his guests ?
In fact , he urges us to do just that .
Actually , he has already taken steps to make such a relationship possible .
The ransom sacrifice of Jesus has opened the door for us so that we can have a friendship with Almighty God .
Paul’s experience was that Jehovah would supply the power needed ​ — “ the power beyond what is normal ” if necessary — ​ so that he could endure .
Perhaps Jehovah has allowed your trials to continue .
The Bible does not state just what Paul’s “ thorn in the flesh ” was .
It might have been a physical affliction , such as poor eyesight .
If this is the case , it would imply that God notices and cares for the bird in its daily activities , not just when it dies . ​ — Matthew 6 : 26 .
Those that were subjected to a more thorough tanning process could hold oil or wine .
What can we learn from Jesus ’ illustration of the sparrows ?
By reading the Bible regularly , we can find assurance that God cares for us personally
1 , 2 .
You might be overwhelmed by one problem after another , while your fellow believers seem to be enjoying life , carefree and happy .
No one is immune to the pressures of this system of things ​ — not even Jehovah’s people .
We live in a world that is ruled by Jehovah’s archenemy , Satan the Devil .
Hannah , for example , was “ bitter of soul ” because she was childless ​ — a condition that she considered tantamount to being forgotten by God .
( b ) What comfort can we draw from God’s Word if we struggle with negative emotions ?
Of course , we know that Hannah , Elijah , and Paul all endured in Jehovah’s service , and He rewarded them richly .
Those encouraging words indicate that Jehovah is deeply interested in each of his servants .
Recall , too , Jesus ’ illustration of the sparrows .
If not one of those small birds falls to the ground without Jehovah’s notice , why would he turn a blind eye to your plight ?
Yes !
A deplorable situation existed among the Jews during the fifth century B.C.E .
To this blatantly corrupt nation , Malachi uttered an astonishing prophecy .
We read : “ ‘ They will certainly become mine , ’ Jehovah of armies has said , ‘ at the day when I am producing a special property .
For one thing , he is an appreciative God .
How does Jehovah provide protection for his people ?
Jehovah does the same with his “ special property . ”
How can appreciating Jehovah in his role as our Rewarder help us fight feelings of doubt ?
He told the Israelites : “ ‘ Test me out , please , in this respect , ’ Jehovah of armies has said , ‘ whether I shall not open to you people the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out upon you a blessing until there is no more want . ’ ”
Ultimately , of course , Jehovah will reward his servants with everlasting life .
Out of his love for them and the high value he places upon them , Jehovah takes the initiative and rewards those earnestly seeking him .
Why is the provision of the ransom the greatest evidence of Jehovah’s love for us ?
Indeed , if Jehovah paid so high a price for us ​ — offering his only - begotten Son — ​ he must surely love us deeply .
Yes , view this gift as a personal provision from Jehovah .
That is what the apostle Paul did .
In saying this , Paul was not being egotistical .
He simply had confidence that Jehovah valued him as an individual .
Like Paul , you too should learn to view the ransom as a personal gift from God .
Beware of Satan’s ‘ Crafty Acts ’
Still , you might find it hard to believe that the inspired consolations found in God’s Word really apply to you .
When we think of Satan’s devices , such things as materialism and immorality might immediately come to mind and rightly so .
18 , 19 .
How is God “ greater than our hearts , ” and in what way does he ‘ know all things ’ ?
Admittedly , it can be difficult to quell feelings of discouragement if these are deeply ingrained .
Or it may be that because of our background , we have an inordinate tendency to think negatively of ourselves , as if nothing we do could be acceptable to Jehovah .
With these words , Jehovah clothed his people with dignity and splendor .
It is as though he held them up high for all to admire .
Elijah
God’s Word contains an abundance of consoling thoughts
Will You Reflect God’s Glory ?
How have we come to know Jehovah in ways that Moses could not ?
Moreover , Moses could perceive only in a limited way the magnificence of Jehovah’s purpose , centered on the Messianic Kingdom and the earthly Paradise it will bring .
Though Christians do not reflect God’s glory by means of rays that beam from their faces , their faces fairly beam as they tell others about Jehovah’s glorious personality and purposes .
Paul was referring in particular to anointed Christians , who are “ ministers of a new covenant . ”
The spiritual prosperity of God’s people gives convincing evidence of Jehovah’s blessing and protection .
For you to bear witness against such a criminal would require courage as well as confidence that the authorities would protect you from him .
In bearing witness to Jehovah and his purposes , we testify against Satan the Devil , exposing him as a manslayer and a liar who is misleading the entire inhabited earth .
His power is infinitely superior to that of Satan .
People in these last days are lovers of money , lovers of themselves , and lovers of pleasures .
How pleasant it is to do so !
During his ministry on earth , Jesus Christ was ridiculed ​ — laughed at , sneered at , made fun of , treated insolently , and even spit upon .
Early Christians were also objects of mockery .
Knowing this can make us strong even under the most extreme circumstances .
No persecution will ever permanently silence us if we remain determined to reflect the glory of God .
Like God , we desire that people of all sorts attain to repentance and salvation ; that is why we preach to them .
How does Jehovah strengthen us to endure in our ministry ?
He answers our prayers and gives us the wisdom to deal with trials .
Think of what that means .
Imagine what a joy it will be to live eternally in Paradise with those whom you have helped to learn about God !
Why is ours a unique period in human history ?
Never again will the good news be preached amid a world alienated from God .
What assurance and encouragement does Jehovah give his servants ?
Can You Explain ?
• How do Christians reflect the glory of God ?
Moses ’ face reflected glory
We reflect the glory of God in our ministry
After all , he had delivered them from Egypt with a mighty hand .
He cared for their needs , providing food and water in the wilderness .
Why were they fearful of beholding a reflection of the glory of Jehovah , the one who had done so much for them ?
Why might the Israelites have been fearful at seeing the glory of God that Moses reflected ?
When they deliberately disobeyed Jehovah by making a golden calf , he disciplined them .
But when Moses would go in [ to the tabernacle ] before Jehovah to speak with him , he would take away the veil until his going out .
And he went out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he would be commanded .
The answers to these questions can help us to evaluate our own relationship with Jehovah .
By the time of Paul’s conversion to Christianity , the Law covenant had been replaced by the new covenant , mediated by Jesus Christ , the Greater Moses .
There was a sharp contrast between the Jews and Jesus ’ disciples , of whom Jesus said : “ Happy are your eyes because they behold , and your ears because they hear . ”
Why the Good News Is Veiled
In what way are many blinded by ignorance , and how can we avoid being similarly affected ?
Explains Paul : “ The reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long - suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life . ”
Like Paul , many who once opposed God’s truth are now serving Him .
This is a good reason for continuing to bear witness even to those who oppose us .
( b ) Is there a parallel in Christendom today ?
Many Jews rejected Jesus and his teachings because they doggedly clung to the Mosaic Law .
Like the first - century Jews , “ they have a zeal for God ; but not according to accurate knowledge . ”
By allowing ourselves to be taught by Jehovah , we are blessed with the knowledge of his will and purpose .
Similarly , many professed Christians readily acknowledge that Jehovah displays mercy , kindness , and forgiveness ; yet they ignore or reject the fact that he does not give exemption from punishment .
How have people been blinded by tradition ?
To religious leaders in his day , Jesus said : “ You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition . ”
By Jesus ’ time , the scribes and the Pharisees had added countless traditions to the Mosaic Law .
Jesus exposed those men as hypocrites because they had lost sight of the righteous principles on which the Law was based .
“ Seeing the One Who Is Invisible ”
The Bible says that Moses “ continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible . ”
And he reflected God’s glory not merely by those rays that emanated from his face for a time but also through his efforts to assist the Israelites to come to know and serve Jehovah .
How did Jesus behold God’s glory , and in what did he delight ?
Theirs was a perfect love between Father and Son .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ When there is a turning to Jehovah [ to do his will ] , the veil is taken away . ”
Jehovah gives an understanding of his purposes and personality to those who are sincere and humble in heart .
We have come under his protective care , and he teaches us to benefit ourselves ​ — to get the most out of life .
• How do we reflect God’s glory ?
( b ) How did Jehovah manifest himself at Mount Sinai ?
Let us now consider a related matter that has meaning for Christians today .
One scholar wrote : “ No moral system ever humanly formulated before or since . . . can approach , much less equal , or excel , these ten words of God . ”
And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation . ” ​ — Exodus 19 : 5 , 6 .
What law has proved to be of more value than laws written on stone ?
Jesus , the Mediator of the new covenant , did not personally impart a written code of law to his followers .
To whom was “ the law of the Christ ” first given , and who later embraced it ?
Unlike the natural Israelites , who were bound to the Mosaic Law by birth , Christians remain under the law of the Christ by choice , factors such as race and place of birth being irrelevant .
They learn about Jehovah and his ways and yearn to do his will .

Jesus thus indicated that , not just the Law with the Ten Commandments , but the entire Hebrew Scriptures were based on love .
Apart from giving his human life that others might live eternally , he showed people how they should live .
He also imparted “ sayings of everlasting life , ” tirelessly helping others to come to know Jehovah . ​ — John 6 : 68 .
If we are to love God , what must we first do ?
Yes , love of God involves obedience .
They are not burdensome , nor are they numerous .
We do not need to memorize an extensive code of rules to direct our every act ; our love for God guides us .
If we love God , it is a pleasure to do his will .
Consider the relationship between Jehovah and Jesus .
Deep , pure love existed between them .
So perfectly did Jesus resemble his heavenly Father that he could say to his disciples : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father . ”
Our love for Jehovah , along with the help of his holy spirit , will enable us to “ strip off the old personality with its practices , and clothe [ ourselves ] with the new personality . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 9 , 10 ; Galatians 5 : 22 , 23 .
How is love for God and neighbor demonstrated by our preaching and teaching activity ?
We can thus find joy in helping others to have the law of the Christ written in their hearts .
I explained that to me , Heidi was really my sister , as close as if we had the same mother and father .
Having God’s law in our hearts , of what should we take advantage ?
Not only do they enjoy Jehovah’s love but they also delight in the strong bond of love in the brotherhood .
“ Look ! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity ! ”

Ever since 1996 , this date has been a memorial day in Germany for victims of Hitler’s Third Reich .
Straub continued : “ Jehovah’s Witnesses , who had to wear a purple triangle on their clothes as concentration camp prisoners , were the only ones who could themselves have put an end to their own martyrdom .
Thus , about 1,200 of them died during the Nazi period .
Referring to his speech , the brochure Landtag Intern called them “ ordinary people who , following their conscience , stood firm for their religious beliefs , showed civil courage , and offered ideological opposition out of Christian conviction . ”
Questions From Readers
In ancient Israel , what was signified by the miraculous light sometimes called Shechinah that appeared in the Most Holy of the tabernacle and the temple ?
This term does not occur in the Bible but is found in Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Scriptures , also known as the Targums .
From where would Jehovah speak ?
The city is New Jerusalem , made up of anointed Christians resurrected to rule with Jesus .
What are some features of our times that make them calamitous ?
Economic pressures , political unrest , crime , and sickness are among the things that make life very difficult .
What challenges have Jehovah’s servants faced ?
3 , 4 .
Rather , they enjoy the wonderful privilege of walking with God .
Moreover , Jehovah expects them to do so .
Pursuing such a course makes us different from most of the people around us .
In addition , walking with God is the most beneficial course possible .
Finally , and most important , when we walk with God , we show where we stand on the great issue that was raised back in the garden of Eden ​ — the issue of sovereignty .
We thus act in harmony with our prayer that God’s name be sanctified and his will be done .
Then , after reporting the length of Enoch’s life ​ — which , while long compared with our life span , was short for those days — ​ the record says : “ Enoch kept walking with the true God . Then he was no more , for God took him . ”
Such brief facts as the foregoing indicate that the corruption introduced by Satan in the garden of Eden quickly led to the spread of wickedness among Adam’s descendants .
Unhappily , the majority of Adam’s offspring were not like Abel .
Paul described the faith of Enoch and other witnesses when he wrote : “ Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for , the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld . ”
Undoubtedly , he knew about the events in Eden .
In addition , Enoch surely cherished Jehovah’s promise to produce a Seed that would crush Satan’s head and undo the ill effects of Satan’s deception .
Indeed , Enoch’s own inspired prophecy , preserved in the book of Jude , has to do with the destruction of Satan’s seed .
Since Enoch had faith , we know that he worshipped Jehovah as the one who “ becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ”
15 , 16 .
How can we follow Enoch’s course ?
Since , like Enoch , we want to please Jehovah during the turbulent times that exist today , we do well to follow Enoch’s example .
Still , his hope was not in that world .
Hence , we do not use this world to the full .
What knowledge do we have that Enoch did not have , so what should we do ?
Enoch had faith that the Seed promised by God would appear in Jehovah’s due time .
May our confidence in the fulfillment of God’s promises influence everything we do .
[ Footnotes ]
• How can we imitate Enoch ?
Imevbore ; collapsing building : San Hong R - C Picture Company
“ We , for our part , shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite , even forever . ” ​ — MICAH 4 : 5 .
As regards morality , what was the situation in Noah’s day , and how was Noah different ?
The record tells us : “ Noah was a righteous man . He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries .
By Noah’s time , mankind in general had deviated from pure worship .
What failing of Noah’s contemporaries did Jesus highlight ?
Still , they “ took no note until the flood came and swept them all away . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 38 , 39 .
However , Jehovah executed judgment on all those who were living “ normal ” lives and taking no note of the meaning of the times they were living in .
How has Revelation 6 : 1 - 4 been fulfilled ?
One of them rides a fiery - colored horse , and to him it was granted “ to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another ; and a great sword was given him . ”
In the days of Noah , Jehovah brought mankind to ruin because of the extreme violence of wicked humans abetted by the Nephilim .
As individuals , we imitate Noah and are active as preachers of righteousness .
Indeed , it is vital that any who desire life keep on walking with God .
Keep Walking With God in Troublous Times
In the first century , anointed Christians were spoken of as belonging to “ The Way . ”
What happened after Jesus miraculously fed a crowd ?
The people were amazed and delighted .
Jesus ’ refusal to accept the kingship likely disappointed many .
Besides , Jesus ’ Kingdom was to be heavenly , not earthly .
13 , 14 .
Nevertheless , not all of Jesus ’ disciples reacted that way .
Peter , one of those loyal disciples , expressed the feelings of all who remained when he said : “ Lord , whom shall we go away to ?
The apostle Paul wrote : “ All Scripture is inspired of God . ”
Through the pages of the Bible , Jehovah tells us clearly : “ This is the way .
Studying the Bible and meditating on what we learn enable us to “ go on walking in the truth . ”
( a ) What do some unwisely do ?
Today , those who become disgruntled because of fleshly thinking or unfulfilled expectations often turn to making the most of what this world has to offer .
Like Enoch and Noah , we live in turbulent times , but like them , we have the privilege of walking with God .
The inspired prophet Micah said of the nations of the world that they would “ walk each one in the name of its god . ”
• What are true Christians determined to do ?
Eck was a contemporary of Martin Luther , and the two were friends for a time .
According to the Kirchliches Handlexikon , his translation stuck faithfully to the original text and “ deserves more recognition than it has received so far . ”
Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses , initially in English in 1961 .

Walk by Faith , Not by Sight !
What shows that the apostle Paul walked by faith , not by sight ?
We must be fully convinced that he really knows what is in our best interests .
Walking by sight , on the other hand , means that we pursue a life course governed solely by what we perceive with our physical senses .
What moved Moses to turn his back on all that Egypt had to offer ?
( b ) What warning example do we find in Esau ?
He lacked spiritual vision .
Esau provides a warning example for us today .
What warning did the Laodicean Christians receive , and why is that of interest to us ?
It was a warning message against materialism .
How do contentment and appreciation for spiritual food protect us ?
A key to spiritual protection is contentment rather than the use of this world to the full and the enrichment of ourselves materially .
Am I using the material possessions I have to live a life of pleasure or to promote true worship ?
What brings me the greatest satisfaction ?
Do I reserve many weekends for recreation instead of using such time for the field ministry and other activities in connection with pure worship ? ’
How were Jesus ’ words recorded at Luke 21 : 20 , 21 fulfilled in the first century ?
Divine judgment was executed upon that Jewish system of things .
Those who walked by faith and heeded Jesus ’ warning escaped the calamity .
Although the Roman armies tried to ensure relative safety throughout the then known world , they became the desolater of Jerusalem .
Likewise today , Bible prophecy indicates that militarized powers within the United Nations will see religion as a disturbing element and will act to destroy modern - day Jerusalem ​ — Christendom — ​ as well as the rest of Babylon the Great .
Yes , the entire world empire of false religion stands on the brink of destruction .
The experiences of ancient Israel illustrate the dangers of allowing walking by sight to weaken one’s faith .
Outward appearances affected the Israelites negatively in other ways .
To their own harm , they foolishly rejected the flawless guidance of Jehovah , preferring instead to be like the surrounding nations . ​ — 1 Samuel 8 : 19 , 20 .
What lessons can we learn about the dangers of walking by sight ?
When the Israelites walked by sight , they forgot that God through Moses was directing them .
Be Resolved to Walk by Faith
“ We have a wrestling , ” states the Bible , “ not against blood and flesh , but against the governments , against the authorities , against the world rulers of this darkness , against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places . ”
He will not overlook any type of persuasion that might sway us from our decision to serve God .
Trust and confidence in Jehovah’s promises will safeguard us from experiencing ‘ shipwreck concerning our faith . ’
As we walk by faith , not by sight , we have a superb Exemplar .
• What did you learn from the examples of Moses and Esau about walking by faith , not by sight ?
• How does walking by faith help us to avoid the view that the end is far off ?

What are the benefits of adhering to the pattern set by Jesus Christ ?
“ The helper , the holy spirit , which the Father will send in my name , ” said Jesus , “ that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you . ”
Christians are exhorted to ‘ cleanse themselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness . ’
One of the means Jesus uses to lead us today is the holy spirit , which Jehovah God has authorized his Son to employ . ​ — Matthew 28 : 18 .
8 , 9 .
We can show our gratitude for the elder arrangement by being obedient and submissive to these “ gifts in men . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 17 .
By what means does Christ lead his followers today , and what is involved in walking as he did ?
Be Reasonable When Exercising Authority
Without pressuring them , Jesus encouraged his followers to ‘ exert themselves vigorously ’ in doing God’s will .
Similarly , Christian elders today do not intimidate others into serving God through shame or guilt .
His approach was to motivate others by reaching their hearts with the principles behind the laws given through Moses .
After arriving at Gethsemane , Jesus “ took Peter and James and John along with him ” and told them to “ keep on the watch . ”
How did Jesus treat Peter thereafter ?
“ He appeared to Cephas , ” says the Bible , “ then to the twelve . ”
Later , Jesus entrusted Peter with great responsibilities . ​ — Acts 2 : 14 ; 8 : 14 - 17 ; 10 : 44 , 45 .
How can we walk as Jesus walked when our fellow believers fail us or wrong us in some way ?
Peter urged his fellow believers : “ All of you be like - minded , showing fellow feeling , having brotherly affection , tenderly compassionate , humble in mind , not paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling , but , to the contrary , bestowing a blessing . ”
What if another person fails to treat us as Jesus would have , refusing to be sympathetic or forgiving ?
Declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom occupied the central place in Jesus ’ life .
What blessings result from encouraging children to take up the full - time service ?
When parents encourage their children to take up full - time service , they as well as their offspring receive many blessings .
A father of twin sons held pioneer service before them as a goal from their early childhood .
Although all of them had to make many adjustments , none of them regret the path they have chosen to follow . ”
Walking as Jesus walked calls for imitating his loyalty .
Concerning Jesus ’ loyalty , the Bible states : “ Although he was existing in God’s form , [ he ] gave no consideration to a seizure , namely , that he should be equal to God . No , but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men .
Adhere to the Pattern Set by Jesus
Of course , as imperfect humans , we cannot walk precisely in the footsteps of our perfect Exemplar .

That includes you and your family .
Jesus spoke about the Kingdom of God , which will remove wickedness and make the earth into a paradise .
His disciples were curious about this and wanted to know when that Kingdom would come .
This sign is composed of several facets , which together make up a composite identifying mark , or signal ​ — the sign of Jesus ’ presence .
Space does not permit a close look at all the details , but we will consider five key elements that make up the sign mentioned by Jesus .
It made a historic break , separating the old from the new , ” states the magazine GEO .
On average , some 6,000 soldiers were killed each day .

Since then , untold numbers have been stricken by such diseases as malaria , smallpox , tuberculosis , polio , and cholera .
We now have the baffling situation that persistent disease exists alongside astonishing medical progress .
“ Earthquakes . ”

Would it not be wiser to recognize the sign and act accordingly ?
We are undoubtedly living in ‘ the last days . ’ ”
Without love of goodness . ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 3
Ridiculers rejecting proof of the last days . ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 3 , 4
There is an urgent need for encouragement , and that is exactly what the Bible book of First Chronicles provides .
The record links the Jews with their past all the way back to the first man .
2 : 15 ​ — Was David the seventh son of Jesse ?
Jesse had eight sons , and David was the youngest .
Luke referred to Neri’s son - in - law as Neri’s son just as he did in the case of Joseph , calling him the son of Mary’s father , Heli . ​ — Luke 3 : 23 .
The other sons of Israel fathered only one tribe each .
The genealogies of real people prove that the entire arrangement of true worship is based , not on myth , but on fact .
5 : 10 , 18 - 22 .
Soon thereafter , he captures Jerusalem .
Later , the Israelites bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem “ with joyful shouting and with the sounding of the horn and with . . . playing aloud on stringed instruments and harps . ” ​ — 1 Chronicles 15 : 28 .
Reserving that privilege for Solomon , Jehovah makes a covenant with David for a Kingdom .
David organizes Levitical services , described here in greater detail than anywhere else in the Scriptures .
11 : 11 ​ — Why is the number of slain 300 and not 800 as in the parallel account at 2 Samuel 23 : 8 ?
The other two mighty men were Eleazar and Shammah .
Abishai was not one of the three mightiest men who served David .
Abishai’s reputation rivaled that of the three principal mighty ones because he performed a mighty act similar to that of Jashobeam .
However , it is generally understood that the reference is to “ the torrent valley of Egypt ” ​ — a long ravine marking the southwest boundary of the Promised Land . ​ — Numbers 34 : 2 , 5 ; Genesis 15 : 18 .
This arrangement continued until the completion of the temple in Jerusalem .
13 : 11 .
14 : 10 , 13 - 16 ; 22 : 17 - 19 .
Through David , he carried out his promise to give Abraham’s seed the entire land of Canaan , extending “ from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river Euphrates . ” ​ — Genesis 15 : 18 ; 1 Chronicles 13 : 5 .
Similar feelings of gratitude should move us to have a spirit of generosity .

The information in this study article is based on the brochure Keep on the Watch !
“ Keep on the watch . . . because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming . ” ​ — MATTHEW 24 : 42 .
To what did Jesus fittingly liken his coming ?
After all , a thief does not send a letter announcing when he is coming .
On the contrary , he comes stealthily and unexpectedly .
But know one thing , that if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) What is involved in heeding Jesus ’ warning about his coming ?
The illustration was fitting , for the precise date of Jesus ’ coming would not be known .
The apostle Paul wrote to fellow believers : “ You yourselves know quite well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night . ”
Earlier , when urging his disciples to seek continually the Kingdom , Jesus cautioned : “ Keep ready , because at an hour that you do not think likely the Son of man is coming . ”
What does not knowing when the end will come allow us to do ?
He sees what is in the heart . ​ — 1 Samuel 16 : 7 .
How does love for Jehovah move us to keep on the watch ?
Above all , we keep on the watch because we eagerly anticipate what Jehovah’s day will mean for the accomplishment of his purpose .
11 - 13 .
The Bible contains many warning examples that can help us to keep on the watch .
Consider what happened in Noah’s day .
What can we learn from that ?
Think , too , about the days of Lot .
Jehovah sent his angels to bring the place to ruin .
As we keep on the watch , what can we expect ?
He proclaims in a loud voice : “ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived . ”
That “ hour ” of judgment is a brief period ; it includes both the pronouncement and the execution of the judgments that are depicted in that prophecy .
We will cherish the privilege of proclaiming the good news of God’s Messianic Kingdom and will do so zealously .
Yes , from God’s viewpoint , Babylon the Great has already fallen .
With good reason , the Bible urges people everywhere : “ Get out of her [ Babylon the Great ] . . . if you do not want to share with her in her sins . ”
This involves more than just severing any ties with false religion .
Babylonish influence is present in many popular celebrations and customs , in the world’s permissive attitude toward sex , in the promoting of entertainment involving spiritism , and much more .
At Revelation 14 : 9 , 10 , a further aspect of ‘ the hour of judgment ’ is described .
Another angel says : “ If anyone worships the wild beast and its image , and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand , he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God . ”
As long as we are living in this old system and are plagued by our own imperfection , we are affected by such things as poor health , old age , the loss of loved ones , hurt feelings , disappointment in the face of apathy toward our efforts to preach God’s Word , and much more .
Never forget that Satan would like nothing better than to exploit the pressures we face to induce us to give up ​ — to stop preaching the good news or to quit living by God’s standards .
This is not the time to lose our sense of urgency regarding the times in which we live !

Let us be resolved to preach with ever greater zeal and determination
Will he develop normally ?
As the child grows older , there are additional concerns .
Naturally , it is their heartfelt desire that their children not go through the same things .
As followers of Jesus Christ , Christians have chosen to dedicate their life to Jehovah .
They have taken to heart Jesus ’ words : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually . ”
Yes , a Christian’s life does involve self - sacrifice .
What did Jesus urge his followers to pursue ?
How do some parents feel about Jesus ’ assurance that God will care for his servants ?
Things are not very different today .
On the one hand , they would like to see their children make advancement in Jehovah’s service , perhaps in time entering the full - time ministry .
Such university education is what is meant when the term “ higher education ” is used in this article .
What pressures are students exposed to in high schools ?
When we think of cost , we usually think of financial expenditures .
Then there is the environment .
Reporting on binge drinking , that is , drinking for the sole purpose of getting drunk , New Scientist magazine says : “ About 44 per cent of [ university students in the United States ] binge at least once in a typical two - week period . ”
The same problem is common among young people in Australia , Britain , Russia , and elsewhere .
When it comes to sexual immorality , the talk among students today is about “ hooking up , ” which according to a Newsweek report “ describes one - time sexual encounters ​ — anything from kissing to intercourse — ​ between acquaintances who’ve no plans to even talk afterward . ”
“ If you’re a normal college student , ” says one researcher , “ you do it . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 5 : 11 ; 6 : 9 , 10 .
What , then , will be left for spiritual activities ?
Today , the popular opinion is that for young people to succeed , the only option is to get a university education .
However , instead of following what is popular , Christians heed the Bible’s admonition : “ Quit being fashioned after this system of things , but be transformed by making your mind over , that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . ”
Paul urged Timothy : “ Keep your senses in all things , suffer evil , do the work of an evangelizer , fully accomplish your ministry . ”
Rather than be caught up by the materialistic spirit of the world , all of us need to ‘ keep our senses ’ ​ — our spiritual bearings .
Have I considered taking up full - time service as a career ? ’
These are challenging questions , especially when you see other youths indulging in selfish pursuits , “ seeking great things ” that they think will lead to a bright future .
How can Christian parents wisely provide the right kind of spiritual environment for their children ?
She also regularly invited those in full - time service ​ — missionaries , traveling overseers , Bethelites , and pioneers — ​ to our home for association .
Listening to their experiences and seeing their joy helped to implant in our hearts the desire for full - time service . ”
Many such institutions offer short courses in office skills , auto repair , computer repair , plumbing , hairdressing , and a host of other trades .
Perhaps they are not as glamorous as some might envision , but they do offer the means and the flexibility needed by those whose true vocation is service to Jehovah . ​ — 2 Thessalonians 3 : 8 .
For accounts of those who valued theocratic education more than university education , see The Watchtower , May 1 , 1982 , pages 3 - 6 ; April 15 , 1979 , pages 5 - 10 ; Awake !
• In what do Christians put their trust for a secure future ?
• How can parents help their children to pursue a career in Jehovah’s service ?
Vocational schools . . . are seeing a mini - boom .
In contrast , note what the Bible says about God : “ I , Jehovah , am your God , the One teaching you to benefit yourself , the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk .
They set aside personal pursuits and followed Jesus
Christian parents wisely provide their children from infancy with a strong spiritual environment
HAS some event ever caused your heart to swell with pride ?
For example , when a Christian couple read a school report about their daughter’s good behavior and hard work , their faces likely glow with warm satisfaction over her accomplishments .
The apostle Paul and his companions took pride in a new congregation that they had helped to establish , for the brothers faithfully endured persecution . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 1 : 1 , 6 ; 2 : 19 , 20 ; 2 Thessalonians 1 : 1 , 4 .
Frequently , though , pride reflects unseemly self - esteem , a feeling of superiority because of one’s abilities , appearance , wealth , or rank .
Such pride is definitely something that we as Christians should guard against .
As a result , our hearts can easily mislead us into feeling proud for the wrong reasons .
For instance , Christians must resist feeling pride over race , wealth , education , natural abilities , or work performance in comparison with others .
If we allow such to grow in our heart , it can develop into a very despicable form of pride called haughtiness .
God Deals With Haughty Ones
How did Pharaoh show haughtiness , and with what result ?
There can be no doubt that Pharaoh had a haughty heart .
Viewing himself as a god to be worshipped , he despised his slaves , the Israelites .
How did Jehovah deal with various haughty ones ?
You are the anointed cherub that is covering . . .
Tyre became exceedingly wealthy as a commercial center and famous for its beautiful products .
What led to Satan’s course of treachery , and what has he continued to do ?
Similarly , the spirit creature who became Satan once had the wisdom needed to fulfill any assignment God gave him .
As “ god of this system of things , ” Satan continues to promote improper feelings of pride and haughtiness .
His goal is to turn them away from God , to become lovers of themselves , self - assuming , and haughty .
On at least three occasions and in the presence of self - righteous enemies , Jesus laid down the rule by which Jehovah deals with mankind : “ Everyone that exalts himself will be humiliated , but he that humbles himself will be exalted . ” ​ — Luke 14 : 11 ; 18 : 14 ; Matthew 23 : 12 .
You may have noted that the examples of haughtiness mentioned above involved prominent men .
Definitely not .
Instead , she allowed her heart to become haughty .
The Bible relates : “ When she became aware that she was pregnant , then her mistress began to be despised in her eyes . ”
But there was a solution to the problem .
The lesson is that even a Christian who has shown a good heart in serving God can become haughty upon gaining wealth or authority .
Yes , a Christian should be alert to keep haughtiness out of his heart .
When the priests warned him not to commit this presumptuous act , “ Uzziah became enraged . ”
You can contrast that with the example of King Hezekiah .
Notice that the cure for Hezekiah’s haughtiness was humility .
Yes , humility is the opposite of haughtiness .
To what can humble Christians look forward ?
Since “ God opposes the haughty ones , ” let us be firmly resolved to reject feelings of improper pride .
As we strive to be humble Christians , we can look forward to surviving God’s great day , when haughty ones and their fruitage will be removed from the earth .
What have many world rulers had in common ?
THE pyramids of Egypt bear testimony to men who once ruled that land .
Of course not !
The Greatest Example of Humility
No one else in the universe has humbled himself to the same extent as the Sovereign Lord in order to help sinful humans .
Why Jesus Was Humble
Nonetheless , the apostle Paul realized that his fellow believers should imitate Jesus and thus be humble in their dealings with one another . ​ — 1 Corinthians 11 : 1 ; Philippians 2 : 3 , 4 .
7 , 8 . ( a ) How did Jesus learn to be humble ?
( b ) Using a young child , what lesson did Jesus teach ?
Certainly , they had desirable qualities that some of his adult disciples did not always display .
You can see this by the many questions they ask .
On one occasion , Jesus singled out a young child and said to His followers : “ Unless you turn around and become as young children , you will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens . ”
That truth raises important questions .
Then came this frank admission : “ Notwithstanding all these exhortations of the Scriptures the perversity of human nature seems to be such that those who become the Lord’s people and who engage to run in this way seem to find more trouble , more to contend against , in this matter than in any other . ”
Likewise , Satan tempts Christians to seek glory for themselves .
Instead , humble Christians strive to follow Jesus ’ example , directing praise and honor to God . ​ — Mark 10 : 17 , 18 .
Paul described this as “ a mock humility . ”
Jesus pointed to examples of such false humility .
In contrast , for our private prayers to have value before God , they should be uttered humbly . ​ — Matthew 6 : 5 , 6 , 16 .
( a ) What can we do to maintain lowliness of mind ?
Reflect on the numerous examples of ones who were blessed for their humble attitude , such as Ruth , Hannah , Elizabeth , and many others .
Think , too , of the many fine examples of prominent men who remained humble in Jehovah’s service , such as David , Josiah , John the Baptizer , and the apostle Paul .
Humble servants of God have moved to new territories and have helped people with different cultures and standards of living .
All of God’s human servants are imperfect .
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you , so do you also . ”
Or the one who takes the initiative to approach the other may do so in a self - righteous , critical manner .
Differences can often be solved by our humbly covering over the matter in love
An Unfair World
After all , whatever our talents are and however wisely we plan our lives , we are guaranteed neither wealth nor success nor even food .
“ When Bad Times Come Suddenly ”
According to Solomon , we are “ like fish caught in a net , like a bird taken in a snare , . . . when bad times come suddenly . ”
Consider what the next article has to say on this subject .
[ Picture Credit Line on page 2 ]
[ Picture Credit Line on page 3 ]
THAT is how the director of one international relief agency described the hopes and aspirations of poor people .
For example , Florence Nightingale , a 19th - century Englishwoman , devoted her life to the cause of providing clean , compassionate nursing care for the sick .
“ Poverty , ” says Irish aid agency Concern , “ kills 30,000 people every day . ”
What has thwarted the efforts of people to bring about complete , lasting change ?
The apostle John tells us that “ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
Until his malign influence is removed , there will be victims of evil and injustice .
This resulted in a second barrier to man’s efforts to produce a fair , just world ​ — sin and imperfection . ​ — Romans 5 : 12 .
However , the use of power raises serious questions .
Is it not true that abuse of power is one of the main grievances of the poor and oppressed of the world ?
Until God acts , we are trapped in an unfair system , “ groaning together and being in pain together . ”
Certainly not .
He is described in the Bible as God’s Chief Agent for the salvation of the human family . ​ — Acts 5 : 31 .
He will bring about the “ restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time . ”
Jesus will , for example , “ deliver the poor one crying for help , also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper . . . .
The blind , the deaf , the lame ​ — all those affected by sickness and disease — ​ will be restored to perfect health .
Jesus Christ will not bring about a partial , temporary change .
However , the context of his words along with the promises of God’s Word shows that he meant that there would always be poor people as long as this system of things lasts .
While we wait for that to happen , let us never hesitate to do anything we can , both spiritually and materially , to “ work what is good ” toward all those who are victims of an unfair world . ​ — Galatians 6 : 10 .

The Ransom Magnifies God’s Righteousness
An important factor was David’s genuine repentance and faith .
Based on the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ , God could pardon the sins of the repentant David and yet maintain His own justice and righteousness .
On the basis of the ransom , repentant human sinners can enjoy a close relationship with God .
At that time , based on the ransom , Jehovah will grant all obedient humans everlasting life .
Jesus himself explained : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
It proves that Jehovah is a God of perfect justice who can deal with sinful humans and still remain pure and holy .
In doing so , they make a fine impression on others .
Consider the experience of 18 - year - old Claire .
But her faith in her heavenly Father , Jehovah , remained strong .
One day , the family doctor , Lydia , called at Claire’s home to check up on Claire’s mother , who was ill .
Afterward , she kindly offered to drive Claire to the shopping center .
Then Lydia asked Claire if she would speak at a seminar on the subject of depression in youths .
One of these girls is now studying the Bible .
“ Jehovah is my Shepherd . I shall lack nothing . ” ​ — PSALM 23 : 1 .
What comparison could you draw that would convey the tender care that he gives his faithful servants ?
He was well - aware that sheep , if left to themselves , easily get lost and become prey for robbers or wild beasts .
Let us consider why this is a fitting statement .
Jehovah bears many titles in the Scriptures , but the designation “ Shepherd ” is among the most tender .
To survive , these helpless creatures need a caring shepherd . ​ — Ezekiel 34 : 5 .
In Ps 23 verse 1 , David expresses his confidence that God will make all necessary provisions for His sheep so that they will “ lack nothing . ”
The Hebrew word rendered “ pastures ” can mean “ pleasant place . ”
Their shepherd must lead them to such a “ pleasant place . ”
How does Jehovah lead us today ?
Certainly , Jehovah sets the finest example in displaying such warm qualities .
We are made in God’s image , meaning that we are endowed with moral qualities and the capacity for spirituality .
Hence , Jehovah knows that despite our imperfections , we have within us the potential for cultivating the same qualities that he exemplifies .
A shepherd considers the limitations of his sheep , so he leads “ according to the pace of the livestock . ”
Therein lies the beauty of the requirement that we be whole - souled .
Jehovah wanted fine offerings that were prompted by grateful hearts .
What a pleasure it is to be led by such an understanding Shepherd !
What assurance does the Bible give us regarding Jehovah’s protection , but what does this not mean ?
How does Jehovah protect his sheep today ?
For example , we may come close to death as a result of persecution or some health crisis .
Jehovah does not promise miraculous intervention .
By means of his holy spirit , he can equip us with “ power beyond what is normal . ”
Is it not comforting to know that Jehovah is ever ready to help us ?
Our Shepherd is with us , helping us in ways that we may not fully perceive at first .
But I was determined not to pull away from Jehovah .
Instead , I voiced my concerns to him .
After all , a good shepherd must know where to find rich pasture grounds and sufficient drinking water so that his flock will “ lack nothing . ” ​ — Psalm 23 : 1 , 2 .
There is no question about that !
There is certainly no shortage of spiritual food .
Our Shepherd is truly a most generous provider ! ​ — Isaiah 25 : 6 ; 65 : 13 .
( b ) What will be discussed in the next article ?
David could hardly have found a more fitting way to describe how Jehovah leads , protects , and feeds his sheep .
What this involves will be discussed in the next article .

“ Be modest in walking with your God . ” ​ — MICAH 6 : 8 .
A BABY , standing on wobbly legs , reaches toward a parent’s outstretched arms and takes its first few steps .
With the ropes of earthling man I kept drawing them , with the cords of love . ”
He also delights in accompanying us as we continue to make progress .
Why do we need to do so ?
Enoch and Noah chose a course in life that was in harmony with the will of Jehovah God .
They trusted in him .
As we make decisions , however , we humbly allow our power of reason to be guided by Jehovah’s infinitely superior mind .
Something about those words may strike you as puzzling .
Imperfect humans have what desperate need , and why do we do well to turn to Jehovah to fill that need ?
One reason why we need to walk with Jehovah God is explained at Jeremiah 10 : 23 : “ I well know , O Jehovah , that to earthling man his way does not belong .
When we do , our walk in life is secure , satisfying , and fulfilling .
The Bible states a grim truth .
However , Jehovah wants more for us than a short , troubled walk from cradle to grave .
Is that not what you want ?
We find the answer at Isaiah 30 : 20 , 21 : “ Your Grand Instructor will no longer hide himself , and your eyes must become eyes seeing your Grand Instructor .
We might think of an instructor standing before his students , demonstrating what he wants them to learn .
In what sense may you “ hear a word behind you ” from your Grand Instructor ?
In Isa 30 verse 21 , a different word picture is painted .
Jehovah is depicted as walking behind his people , issuing directions on the right way to walk .
Bible scholars have noted that this expression might be based on the way a shepherd sometimes follows his sheep , calling out to guide them and to keep them from going the wrong way .
They are coming from behind us , as it were , in the stream of time .
In a spiritual sense , Jehovah’s rebellious people in Israel needed to do something similar .
Sadly , Israel responded stubbornly to this loving reminder from Jehovah .
To this day , the anointed help one another as well as their “ other sheep ” companions to pursue the healthful , happy way of life that Christendom has abandoned . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
By providing spiritual food at the proper time , the faithful slave class has helped millions to find “ the roadways of long ago ” and to walk with God .
If so , what can you do to avoid drifting away , turning to follow your own course ?
And when you humbly apply the counsel you are given , you are indeed walking with God , following “ the roadways of long ago . ”
If Jehovah is real to us , how will that be reflected in the personal decisions that we make ?
Like King David of old , we resolve : “ I shall walk about in the integrity of my heart inside my house . ” ​ — Psalm 101 : 2 .
How will associating with our Christian brothers and sisters help us to see Jehovah as real ?
He does much to help us overcome such weakness .
How will learning about Jesus help us to walk with God ?
No one comes to the Father except through me . ”
What blessing does Jehovah want to bestow upon you , and what is your resolve ?
This is well - expressed at Micah 4 : 5 : “ All the peoples , for their part , will walk each one in the name of its god ; but we , for our part , shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite , even forever . ”

Good Conduct Bears Fruit
ON A small island off the coast of southern Japan , a mother and her three young children began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
The deputy mayor wanted to honor the children for their role in this change .
But their mother assured him that they were only doing what Christians should do .
Hosea’s Prophecy Helps Us to Walk With God
“ After Jehovah they will walk . ” ​ — HOSEA 11 : 10 .
The setting for this drama is found in Hosea chapter 1 .
3 , 4 .
He would hold an accounting against both idolatrous Israel and the wayward kingdom of Judah .
Fornication was rampant in Israel in both a physical and a spiritual sense .
In 997 B.C.E . , ten of Israel’s tribes separated from the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin .
Worship of the false god Baal , with its sex orgies , became entrenched in Israel .
As foretold at Hosea 1 : 6 , what happened to Israel ?
Jehovah’s Legal Case Against Israel
Gomer left Hosea and became “ a wife of fornication , ” living adulterously with another man .
No wonder Jehovah had a legal case against the spiritually adulterous nation ! ​ — Hosea 1 : 2 ; 2 : 2 , 12 , 13 .
What happened to the Law covenant when Jehovah allowed Israel and Judah to go into exile ?
That relationship was done away with only after Jewish leaders rejected Jesus Christ and had him put to death in 33 C.E . ​ — Colossians 2 : 14 .
“ Therefore , ” said Jehovah , “ here I am hedging your way about with thorns ; and I will heap up a stone wall against her , so that her own roadways she will not find .
And she will have to say , ‘ I want to go and return to my husband , the first one , for I had it better at that time than now . ’
But she herself did not recognize that it was I who had given to her the grain and the sweet wine and the oil , and that I had made silver itself abound for her , and gold , which they made use of for Baal [ or , which “ they made into a Baal image , ” footnote ] . ” ​ — Hosea 2 : 6 - 8 .
Another Look at the Drama
While exiles from Israel and Judah were captives in Babylon , God used his prophets to ‘ speak to their heart . ’
Take the Lessons to Heart
17 - 19 . ( a ) What qualities of God are we here urged to imitate ?
If they do , Jehovah welcomes them .
He showed mercy to repentant members of the nation of Israel , with which he had entered a figurative marriage .
Give an example to show that we should have confidence in God - given hope .
For example , he promised : “ I will give her . . . the low plain of Achor as an entrance to hope . ”
Yet , some prized divine teaching highly , acted in harmony with it , and were greatly blessed .
Apostate leaders were a trap and a net for the Israelites , enticing them to practice idolatry .
By doing so , we will reap what is good and have the incomparable joy and peace experienced by all who faithfully walk with God . ​ — Psalm 100 : 2 ; Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
A symbolic drama is presented at Galatians 4 : 21 - 26 .
• Which lesson in Hosea chapters 1 to 5 impressed you ?
Joyful people return to their homeland
How can we walk with Jehovah ?
We are wise to walk with him rather than trying to direct our own steps .
Briefly relate the contents of Hosea chapters 6 through 9 .
In other words , adverse judgment was coming .
But Hosea’s prophecy also contains a heartwarming message .
He will make us alive after two days .
And we will know , we will pursue to know Jehovah . Like dawn , his going forth is firmly established .
And he will come in like a pouring rain to us ; like a spring rain that saturates the earth . ”
Some ascribe these statements to the unfaithful Israelites and say that the disobedient people were feigning repentance and presuming upon God’s mercy .
( Footnote ) The people were not willing to return to Jehovah’s exalted worship by making the changes that were needed to restore their relationship with him .
There was another problem with Israel’s repentance .
Genuine repentance is made apparent by actions .
Hosea 6 : 6 says : “ In loving - kindness I [ Jehovah ] have taken delight , and not in sacrifice ; and in the knowledge of God rather than in whole burnt offerings . ”
By their sinfulness they indicated that their hearts were devoid of loyal love .
Their sacrifices were offensive to Jehovah God .
It is true that we do not offer animal sacrifices to Jehovah .
Nevertheless , we do “ offer to God a sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name . ”
She later admitted : “ I increased my field ministry , thinking that this would somehow cover up the wrong . ”
That was similar to what the wayward Israelites tried to do .
However , our sacrifice of praise is acceptable to Jehovah only if it is accompanied by the proper heart motivation and godly conduct .
The situation is a personal one in which love has been violated . ”
What about us ?
God cares about whether we walk with him or not .
Hosea 8 : 13 states : “ He [ Jehovah ] will remember their error and hold an accounting for their sins . ”
Jehovah would hold the Israelites accountable for their sins .
The experience of the Israelites teaches us what ?
God’s Word warns us : “ Do not be misled : God is not one to be mocked .
For example , those who pursue an immoral way of life will reap bitter consequences .
If a farmer wants to harvest wheat , would he plant barley ?
Of course not !
Similarly , if we want to reap what is good , we must sow what is good .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Picture on page 23 ]
Israel’s evil desires burned like a furnace
This is evident from Hosea chapters 10 through 14 .
We will consider what principles from Hosea’s prophecy ?
These apostates had even put up pillars ​ — perhaps obelisks designed for use in unclean worship .
Yet , what had happened to the Israelites ?
Although they had once entered a covenant with Jehovah as a people dedicated to him , he found them guilty of hypocrisy .
7 , 8 . ( a ) Under what circumstances can we enjoy God’s loyal love ?
( b ) What should we do if we have sinned seriously ?
The wayward Israelites were told : “ Sow seed for yourselves in righteousness ; reap in accord with loving - kindness . Till for yourselves arable land , when there is time for searching for Jehovah until he comes and gives instruction in righteousness to you . ” ​ — Hosea 10 : 12 .
9 , 10 .
But as for me , I taught Ephraim [ the Israelites ] to walk , taking them upon my arms ; and they did not recognize that I had healed them .
Jehovah lovingly taught the Israelites to walk , taking them upon his arms .
What a touching picture !
Well , Jehovah’s love for you is just as tender .
To go on walking with God , we must hope in him constantly .
Hosea’s prophecy involving the Israelites gives us a special reason to hope in God .
“ From death I shall recover them .
Where is your destructiveness , O Sheol ? ”
‘ Death , where is your victory ?
But thanks to God , for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ ! ”
15 , 16 .
The inhabitants of Samaria did not walk in God’s righteous ways .
Consequently , they would have to pay a price for their sin and lack of faith in Jehovah .
It was foretold : “ Samaria will be held guilty , for she is actually rebellious against her God .
Their own children will be dashed to pieces , and their pregnant women themselves will be ripped up . ”
Samaria was the capital city of the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel .
Nevertheless , Sargon’s records refer to the deportation of 27,290 Israelites to places in the Upper Euphrates and Media .
Rather than treating God’s standards with contempt , what should we do ?
Balaam accepted payment from Moab’s king but tried in vain to curse Israel .
19 , 20 .
Repentant Israelites were able to offer God ‘ the young bulls of their lips . ’
Paul alluded to this prophecy when he urged Christians to “ offer to God a sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name . ”
21 , 22 .
They will again be dwellers in his shadow . They will grow grain , and will bud like the vine .
As long as Jehovah allows us to give a witness , we will keep on looking for those who will wisely accept his undeserved kindness .
Our consideration of Hosea’s prophecy should help us to do what ?
Our consideration of Hosea’s prophecy should help us to go on walking with God with everlasting life in his promised new world in view .
• Why should we hope in Jehovah constantly ?
• How can we continue to walk in Jehovah’s upright ways ?

The making of bulls for this purpose did not in any way violate the second commandment , which prohibited the making of objects for worship . ​ — Exodus 20 : 4 , 5 .
First Kings 7 : 26 states : “ Two thousand bath measures [ 11,600 gallons [ 44,000 L ] ] were what [ the sea ] would contain . ”

When Shaphan the secretary brought the newly discovered book of Jehovah’s Law to King Josiah , the king had it read aloud .
So touched was Josiah by what he heard that he zealously promoted pure worship throughout his life .
Weeks earlier , Jews and proselytes from at least 15 regions of the far - flung Roman Empire and beyond had packed Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover .
By the end of the day , the small group of disciples had grown to be a vast company of more than 3,000 ! ​ — Acts 2 : 37 - 42 .
How did the preaching work expand as the disciples moved out from Jerusalem , Judaea , and Galilee ?
Soon after that momentous event , a wave of persecution broke out in Jerusalem , and “ those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word . ”
He also preached to an Ethiopian official who responded to the message about Christ . ​ — Acts 6 : 1 - 5 ; 8 : 5 - 13 , 26 - 40 ; 21 : 8 , 9 .
An Impartial God ​ — A Message for All
After the apostle Peter was helped by Jehovah to adjust his view of people of the nations , he appreciatively noted : “ For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial , but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him . ”
6 , 7 .
What Bible prophecies foretold the international , multilingual spread of the good news ?
This international expansion was foretold centuries earlier .
According to Daniel’s prophecy , “ there were given [ to Jesus ] rulership and dignity and kingdom , that the peoples , national groups and languages should all serve even him . ”
The Bible foretold a time when people of diverse languages would hear its life - giving message .
Do we as Christian ministers view the presence of such people who speak different languages as an impediment to our ministry ?
For example , as of August 2004 , the preaching work in Germany was being carried out in about 40 languages .
In Greece , Jehovah’s Witnesses were reaching people in almost 20 different languages .
Eagerly embracing that commission , Jehovah’s Witnesses are active in 235 lands , distributing literature in more than 400 languages .
Learning a new language is a major undertaking .
Rather than imparting miraculous linguistic abilities , the spirit can heighten our desire to communicate with people who do not speak our language .
( b ) How is the spirit of self - sacrifice seen ?
Others feel invigorated when their service becomes more challenging and interesting .
In Norway , a couple studies with a family from Afghanistan .
Why not start by noting which foreign languages are commonly spoken in your territory ?
The booklet Good News for People of All Nations , released in 2004 , has already been instrumental in spreading the Kingdom hope by its simple , positive message in numerous languages . ​ — See the article “ Good News for People of All Nations , ” on page 32 .
For example , in one large city in North America , five congregations meet in the same Kingdom Hall .
Loving overseers commend qualified and skilled brothers and sisters who want to move to assist other language groups .
Those elders did not hold Timothy back from traveling with Paul , even though Timothy was an asset to their own congregations .

Many foreigners respond well to Bible truth
A Changed Man Met the Challenge
Not being content to pursue believers in Jerusalem only , he began spreading his hate campaign as far north as Damascus . ​ — Acts 9 : 1 , 2 .
At the root of Paul’s intense hatred of Christianity might well have been the conviction that the new faith would corrupt Judaism by mixing it with foreign , undesirable ideas .
Why , Pharisees refused even to eat with those whom they considered to be sinners !
This can instill in us views and attitudes that are biased , prejudiced , inflexible .
He accepted the challenge to expand his ministry .
A Progressive Minister in Action
How was Paul attentive to the background of his listeners , and with what result ?
Then Paul skillfully used his knowledge of Agrippa’s beliefs and discussed with him matters that the king understood very well .
Paul was also flexible .
In Athens , he was at first “ irritated at beholding that the city was full of idols . ”
How did Paul demonstrate resourcefulness when dealing with different audiences ?
In dealing with different audiences , Paul manifested remarkable resourcefulness .
He took into account the culture and environment that shaped the thinking of his audience .
For example , Paul knew that the people in Rome were acquainted with the system of slavery throughout the Roman Empire .
In fact , many of the people to whom he was writing were probably slaves .
“ Among the Romans , ” says one reference work , “ an owner could free a slave outright , or the slave could purchase his freedom by paying his owner .
We endeavor to discern their needs and concerns , their likes and dislikes , and their fears and prejudices .
Witnesses elsewhere endeavor to do the same .
Kingdom publishers there try to highlight these subjects instead of discussing such matters as deteriorating global conditions or complex social issues .
Help for New Ministers
He saw the need for training and preparing those of a younger generation , such as Timothy and Titus , to become effective ministers .
He first emphasized the need for the preaching work and encouraged a prayerful attitude .
Whether we are helping our own child , a new student , or someone who has not shared in the preaching activity for a while , it is appropriate to make an effort to provide training in this way .
New ones need considerable help to gain confidence in presenting the Kingdom message .
Warmly commend new ones for their efforts , and when appropriate , offer brief suggestions for improvement .
When we consider the importance of our goal ​ — to impart the very knowledge of God that leads to salvation — ​ we are convinced that it is worth all the effort it takes to become “ all things to people of all sorts , that [ we ] might by all means save some . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 4 : 5 ; 1 Corinthians 9 : 22 .
[ Footnotes ]
• In what ways can we imitate Paul in our ministry ?
• What changes in our thinking are likely needed ?
The apostle Paul was attentive , flexible , and resourceful in preaching and teaching
Whom Do You Obey ​ — God or Men ?
The prisoners were missing .
Now the court was ready to deal with his closest followers .
An angel had released the apostles from prison .
It was in order that the inhabitants of Jerusalem should hear the good news about Jesus Christ .
Two of those tenacious preachers , the apostles Peter and John , had been in court before , as the chief justice , Joseph Caiaphas , sternly reminded them .
When ordered to stop preaching the first time , the two apostles answered : “ Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves . But as for us , we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard . ”
Like the ancient prophet Jeremiah , Peter and John could not hold back from carrying out their commission to preach . ​ — Acts 4 : 18 - 20 ; Jeremiah 20 : 9 .
God as Ruler Versus Man as Ruler
However , no human , no matter how powerful , is authorized to order another to disobey one of God’s commands .
Not only is he “ the Judge of all the earth ” but he is also the Supreme Lawgiver , as well as the King of eternity .
Thus , the Sanhedrin crossed the line when it ordered the apostles to stop preaching .
Why did the preaching work anger the chief priests ?
The judges of the Sanhedrin were determined to have them put to death .
However , events took an unexpected turn .
Then , significantly , Gamaliel added : “ Otherwise , you may perhaps be found fighters actually against God . ” ​ — Acts 5 : 34 , 38 , 39 .
What proves that the apostles ’ work was from God ?
Far from being intimidated , however , the apostles were determined to obey the angelic command to preach .
Jehovah blessed their efforts .
From a human standpoint , why might Caiaphas have felt secure in his position , but why was his confidence misplaced ?
In the first century , the Jewish high priests were appointed by the Roman authorities .
Caiaphas likely attributed this accomplishment to his skill as a diplomat and his personal friendship with Pilate rather than to divine providence .
The order to strip Caiaphas of his office came from Pilate’s immediate superior , Lucius Vitellius , governor of Syria , and Caiaphas ’ close friend Pilate was unable to prevent it .
God also appointed Jesus as Judge of the living and the dead .
In our day , as in the first century , there has been no shortage of ‘ fighters against God . ’
They even managed to kill some Witnesses .
In the years since the Nazis ’ efforts , others have joined the losing battle against Jehovah and his people .
Opposers must know that .
How might Jehovah deliver us from persecution today ?
He might raise up a fair - minded judge like Gamaliel .
And no matter what God permits , we have no doubt as to the final outcome : Those who fight against God’s people are fighting against God , and fighters against God will not prevail .

Do you also believe that Bible prophecies point to our time as “ the last days ” of Satan’s wicked system ?
King Ahab , under the influence of his pagan wife , Jezebel , promoted Baal worship in the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel .
Baal was a fertility god who was supposed to provide rain and fruitful crops .
But it was apostasy for an Israelite to turn away from Jehovah and worship a false god .
Such religious support of worldly governments is identified in the Bible as spiritual fornication .
God’s Love for His Wayward People
How did Jehovah show loving concern for his wayward people ?
After a devastating drought , which was announced in advance , Elijah told King Ahab to gather the Israelites and Baal prophets together on Mount Carmel . ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 1 , 19 .
Sadly , the Israelites in attendance were not sure who ​ — Jehovah or Baal — ​ was in the best position to produce the much - needed rain .
Now came Elijah’s turn .
Then Elijah prayed : “ O Jehovah , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , today let it be known that you are God in Israel and I am your servant and it is by your word that I have done all these things .
“ They immediately fell upon their faces and said : ‘ Jehovah is the true God !
All 450 Baal prophets were then executed at the foot of Mount Carmel . ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 38 - 40 .
Jezebel continued her campaign of persecuting Jehovah’s servants .
Some of these occasionally come to Christian meetings , such as the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal or sessions of a district convention .
We urge all such ones to consider carefully Elijah’s words : “ How long will you sit on the fence ? ”
Instead of delaying , they need to take decisive action now and zealously work toward the goal of becoming dedicated , baptized worshippers of Jehovah .
Into what dangerous condition have some baptized Christians slipped , and what should they do ?
Jesus warned that these very things would stumble , choke , and ensnare some of his followers .
What commission did Jehu receive , and how did he respond ?
Jehu was a decisive man .
( a ) What situation did Jezebel’s court officials suddenly face ?
Ignoring her , Jehu called for support : “ Who is with me ?
Two or three court officials stuck their heads out of the window .
The officials let Jezebel drop to the street below , where she was trampled by Jehu’s horses and chariot .
After false religion’s end , Jehovah God will turn his attention to all humans who make up the secular parts of Satan’s world .
After Jezebel’s death , King Jehu wasted no time in executing all Ahab’s descendants and key supporters .
All Baal worshippers in Israel came to the festival .
What grand prospect awaits the “ great crowd ” of Jehovah’s loyal worshippers ?
Baal worship was eradicated from Israel .
Act decisively now , and you may be privileged to be included among the “ great crowd ” of human survivors of “ the great tribulation . ”

In Britain , for example , donations to charity reached a record $ 13 billion ( U.S . ) in 2002 .
“ These episodes , ” states the journal American Political Science Review , “ have cost the lives of at least 12 million and as many as 22 million noncombatants , more than all victims of internal and international wars since 1945 . ”
Ethnic hatred in Rwanda led to the deaths of more than 800,000 men , women , and children .
At the same time , we have seen Iraqi prisoners disgracefully abused .
In Darfur , we see whole populations displaced , and their homes destroyed , while rape is used as a deliberate strategy .
In northern Uganda , we see children mutilated and forced to take part in acts of unspeakable cruelty .
He had a deep love for God , a yearning for justice , and an affection for the lowly .
However , when Eve and then Adam chose to rebel against God , they lost the ability to produce sinless children .
The apostle Paul’s experience highlights a second reason why people do evil things .
He had expended himself unselfishly in the service of his Christian brothers and sisters .
For example , Jesus warned his followers : “ The hour is coming when everyone that kills you will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God . ”
Addressing the religious leaders who were intent on killing him , he said : “ You are from your father the Devil , and you wish to do the desires of your father .
That one was a manslayer when he began . ”
If evil is to be permanently eliminated from human society , man’s inborn inclination toward badness , his lack of accurate knowledge , and Satan’s influence must be addressed .
No human surgeon or man - made medicine can perform that task .
The apostle John wrote : “ The blood of Jesus . . . cleanses us from all sin . ”
When the perfect man Jesus voluntarily offered up his life , he “ bore our sins in his own body upon the stake , in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness . ”
Paul states that Christ Jesus became “ a corresponding ransom for all . ”
Yes , Christ’s death opened the way for all mankind to regain the perfection that Adam had lost .
You may ask , though , ‘ If Jesus ’ death some 2,000 years ago made it possible for mankind to regain perfection , why do evil and death still exist ? ’
In addition , Paul zealously preached “ this good news of the kingdom . ”
During the almost 2,000 years since Jesus ’ death and resurrection , Christ has selected from among mankind those who , like Paul , will rule with him in his Kingdom . ​ — Revelation 5 : 9 , 10 .
The Ultimate Conquest of Evil
Christ will also resurrect all those worthy of the opportunity to live on the restored earth .
“ Keep on , then , seeking first the kingdom . ” ​ — MATTHEW 6 : 33 .
1 , 2 .
What step as to employment did a young man take , and why ?
The problem was that his secular work interfered with his regular meeting attendance .
Today , one section of humanity lives in the deepest poverty while another enjoys the highest standard of living in history .
“ Stop Being Anxious ”
How did Jesus illustrate that it was reasonable for God’s people not to be overly anxious about everyday concerns ?
They knew that if they did not work hard , their families would suffer .
However , Jesus reminded them about the birds .
Still , those Christians did not look to secular work for security .
They trusted in Jehovah .
What balance do Christians maintain ?
Even if they have to spend long hours in secular work in order to care for Scriptural responsibilities , they never allow the need to earn money to blind them to the more important spiritual matters . ​ — Ecclesiastes 7 : 12 .
However much he loved Jehovah , he loved his possessions more .
That event led Jesus to say something unexpected : “ It will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens . . . .
No , for he went on to say : “ With God all things are possible . ”
Indeed , with Jehovah’s help some wealthy people back then did become anointed Christians .
As a result , he might not feel the same need for Jehovah’s support .
Cultivate the Right Viewpoint
Jesus said to them : “ You say : ‘ I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all , ’ but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked . ”
It was the fact that they trusted in wealth rather than in Jehovah .
In that country , such an offer is viewed as a way to a secure future .
She chose to seek first the Kingdom and remain in full - time service .
They have cultivated a number of fine qualities .
Our faith is renewed , and our hope confirmed . ​ — Ephesians 3 : 16 - 19 .
In this fast - moving world , it is difficult to be patient .
Everlasting life on a paradise earth ​ — surely that is worth waiting for !
However , Jesus also counseled us to keep on “ seeking first . . . [ God’s ] righteousness . ”
Many who heard Jesus ’ words were poor
Seeking Righteousness Will Protect Us
“ Keep on , then , seeking first . . .
This she flatly refused , even though it would mean the loss of her employment .
Was that young Christian woman unrealistic ?
The Importance of Righteousness
It is uprightness according to Jehovah’s standards .
Why is righteousness important ?
That is why the apostle Paul urged Timothy : “ Flee from the desires incidental to youth , but pursue righteousness , ” along with other vital qualities .
On that basis , as we learn Jehovah’s righteous standards and do our utmost to observe them ​ — praying for help to overcome our weaknesses — ​ Jehovah accepts our worship .
Righteous in an Unrighteous World
When Jesus ’ disciples received the commission to be his witnesses “ to the most distant part of the earth , ” they faced a difficult situation .
The world was infected with the wicked spirit that he promotes , and Christians would be exposed to its contaminating influence .
Toward the end of their 40 - year trek in the wilderness , a large number of Israelites turned from the path of righteousness .
The record says : “ The people started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Moab . ” ​ — Numbers 25 : 1 .
Now , it is routine .
Pictures of graphic sex are also easily accessible on the Internet .
In addition , how many parents know the contents of the video games their children play ?
In his letter to Christians in Colossae , Paul warned against the “ worship of the angels . ” ​ — Colossians 2 : 18 .
Today , true Christians likewise need to avoid popularly accepted customs based on false religious ideas that violate Christian principles .
In some lands , for example , many customary ceremonies surrounding birth and death are based on the lie that we have a spirit that survives death .
Do Not Forget Jehovah
Shortly before the Israelites entered the Promised Land , Jehovah warned them not to forget him .
Eve wanted to make her own decisions about right and wrong .
In the world today , many are “ headstrong , puffed up with pride , ” and some Christians have been influenced by that way of thinking .
Recognizing its vital role will help us to ‘ do nothing out of egotism ’ as we humbly submit to Jehovah’s righteous will . ​ — Philippians 2 : 2 - 4 ; Proverbs 3 : 4 - 6 .
We are encouraged to imitate Jesus in what ways ?
Of Jesus , the Bible prophetically says : “ You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness . ”
19 , 20 .
They belong to Jehovah and live to serve him , not to please themselves .
That is what governs their thoughts and actions .
Valuable suggestions for parents on protecting the family from immoral influences are found in the book The Secret of Family Happiness , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .

Like Jesus , Christians hate unrighteousness
TO SOME people the idea of meditating may be intimidating .
However , silently pondering truths we have learned about Jehovah , his beautiful qualities , his awesome accomplishments , his requirements , and his glorious purpose can and should be a very pleasurable way to spend time .
Jehovah God is the Supreme Ruler of the universe and is busy working toward the fulfillment of his great purpose .
Even so , he concerns himself with the silent thoughts of each individual worshipper .
The psalmist David knew this and wrote under divine inspiration : “ O Jehovah , you have searched through me , and you know me .
He most certainly does .
Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Its writer , Ezra the priest , begins the account with the issuing of a decree by King Cyrus of Persia that allows a remnant of the Jews exiled in Babylon to return to their homeland .
Hence , Ezra focuses only on the events that pertain to this purpose .
THE TEMPLE IS REBUILT
An official investigation brings to light Cyrus ’ order “ concerning the house of God in Jerusalem . ”
The work progresses well and comes to completion .
Some may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship , but this was not true in every case .
The claimants to priestly descent who failed to establish their genealogy could have given legitimacy to their claim by using the Urim and the Thummim .
The groundwork of the new temple that was before them was “ as nothing in [ their ] eyes ” in comparison .
Thus , the temple construction took about 20 years .
1 : 2 .
4 : 1 - 3 .
6 : 14 , 22 .
Zealously sharing in Jehovah’s work brings his approval and blessing .
Fifty years have elapsed since the rebuilt house of Jehovah was inaugurated .
The year is 468 B.C.E .
Even though more than 60 years had passed since the first group of Jews had returned to their homeland , Jerusalem was only sparsely settled .
Intermarriage with other inhabitants was a real threat to true worship .
7 : 10 .
He prayerfully prepared his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah .
7 : 27 , 28 ; 8 : 21 - 23 .
We must take seriously the admonition to marry “ only in the Lord . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 7 : 39 .
Bad associations can lead to Jehovah’s disapproval .
Jehovah Keeps His Promises
Right on time , Jehovah fulfilled his promise to free his people from Babylonian exile and restore true worship in Jerusalem .
Indeed , Ezra’s inspired words furnish clear proof that “ the word of God is alive and exerts power . ” ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 . [ Chart / Picture on page 18 ] PERSIAN KINGS FROM 537 TO 467 B.C.E . Cyrus the Great died in 530 B.C.E . Cambyses , or Ahasuerus 530 - 22 B.C.E . Artaxerxes ​ — Bardiya or Gaumata 522 B.C.E . ( Assassinated after reigning only seven months ) Darius I 522 - 486 B.C.E .

[ Picture ] Ahasuerus [ Picture on page 17 ] Cyrus [ Picture on page 17 ] The Cyrus Cylinder stated the policy of returning captives to their homelands [ Credit Line ] Cylinder : Photograph taken by courtesy of the British Museum [ Picture on page 20 ] Do you know what made Ezra an effective teacher ?
FOR centuries , many people thought of the Devil as a horned , cloven - hoofed creature clad in red and using a pitchfork to cast wicked humans into a fiery hell .
Undoubtedly , however , such misconceptions have caused millions to question the existence of the Devil or to think that the term applies only to a principle of evil .
He is also called Satan ( meaning “ Resister ” ) , since he resists Jehovah .
*
We must therefore heed the apostle Paul’s counsel : “ Do not give the Devil a chance . ”
What , then , are some of Satan’s traits that we must not imitate ?
“ The wicked one ” deserves to be called the Devil , for he is a slanderer .
Slander is a false , malicious , and defamatory statement about someone .
Eve had been informed of this , but through a serpent , the Devil told her : “ You positively will not die .
The Israelites were commanded : “ You must not go around among your people for the sake of slandering . ”
The apostle John stated concerning a slanderer in his day : “ I wrote something to the congregation , but Diotrephes , who likes to have the first place among them , does not receive anything from us with respect .
That is why , if I come , I will call to remembrance his works which he goes on doing , chattering about us with wicked words . ”
Paul was falsely accused by High Priest Ananias and others .
Yet , that could happen if we did not have all the facts before bearing witness against someone .
The Devil is a manslayer .
Beginning with his first act in turning Adam and Eve away from God , Satan has been a manslayer .
As indicated at 1 John 3 : 15 , how can we become manslayers ?
Addressing Christians , the apostle Peter wrote : “ Let none of you suffer as a murderer . ”
“ When he speaks the lie , ” said Jesus , “ he speaks according to his own disposition , because he is a liar and the father of the lie . ”
Satan lied to Eve , whereas Jesus came into the world to bear witness to the truth .
If we cherish our spiritual freedom from satanic lies , we will cling to Christianity , “ the way of the truth . ”
12 , 13 .
“ But , ” wrote Paul , “ shun empty speeches that violate what is holy ; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness , and their word will spread like gangrene . Hymenaeus and Philetus are of that number . These very men have deviated from the truth , saying that the resurrection has already occurred ; and they are subverting the faith of some . ”
Despite the wiles of the foremost apostate , why have we been loyal to God and his Word ?
Despite the wiles of the foremost apostate , the spiritual vigilance of the faithful and discreet slave class has helped these true Christians to remain loyal to Jehovah and his Word . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 .
No wonder the apostle John warned us not to love the world !
We must not love the world , for its way of life appeals to the sinful flesh and is diametrically opposed to Jehovah God’s standards .
This unrighteous world hates us because we keep separate from it and are ‘ preachers of righteousness . ’
Allow No Place for the Devil
21 , 22 .
How can you apply Paul’s counsel recorded at Ephesians 4 : 26 , 27 ?
Our anger could result in sin if we remained in a provoked state .
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
See the cover series “ Is the Devil Real ? ”
Oppose Satan , and He Will Flee !
“ Subject yourselves . . . to God ; but oppose the Devil , and he will flee from you . ” ​ — JAMES 4 : 7 .
The pride of “ the king of Babylon ” was similar to the spirit of Satan , “ the god of this system of things . ”
How can we avoid being overreached by the Devil ?
This lack of fear does not stem from inherent courage .
It exists because they have reverential fear of God and ‘ take refuge in the shadow of his wings . ’ ​ — Psalm 34 : 9 ; 36 : 7 .
They did not succumb to fear of what Satan the Devil could do , for they knew that Jehovah would never abandon those who proved loyal to Him .
However , the apostle Paul indicated that the Devil could cause death .
Nevertheless , we should not think that the Devil can cause the death of any individual whom he wants to kill .
Yet , the Scriptures hold out the wonderful hope of a resurrection for those in God’s “ book of remembrance ” ​ — and the Devil can do absolutely nothing to prevent such restoration of life ! ​ — Malachi 3 : 16 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
In Eden , Jehovah foretold that there would be enmity between his symbolic “ woman ” and the “ serpent ” and between their respective ‘ seeds . ’
Are you aware of the underlying reason for such satanic persecution ?
9 , 10 .
Our God is the Universal Sovereign , and he will help us to maintain our integrity .
Do Not Be Overreached by the Devil
When Paul urged Christians in Corinth to be forgiving , he wrote : “ Anything you kindly forgive anyone , I do too . In fact , as for me , whatever I have kindly forgiven , if I have kindly forgiven anything , it has been for your sakes in Christ’s sight ; that we may not be overreached by Satan , for we are not ignorant of his designs . ”
Protected by Armor From God
This armor includes “ the breastplate of righteousness . ”
We stand our ground in spiritual warfare , although Satan uses various crafty means in his efforts to disrupt our unity , corrupt our teachings , or break our integrity to God .
But the Devil’s assaults have not succeeded so far ​ — and they never will !
*
We can be successful in our spiritual warfare against the Devil and the wicked spirit forces under his direction .
With the support of Jehovah God and his beloved Son , nobody can do us permanent harm ​ — no , not even the Devil ! ​ — Psalm 91 : 9 - 11 .
The Devil cannot prevent the resurrection of those who are in Jehovah’s memory
* Their real goal was to establish a godly community where they and their descendants could prosper materially without having to compromise the Bible’s standards .
Shortly after landing at Salem , Massachusetts , they laid claim to a small plot of land down the coast .
They called their new home Boston .
Like other Puritan leaders , Winthrop believed that the pursuit of wealth was not wrong in itself .
All too soon , however , the entrepreneurial spirit of his fellow citizens tended to clash with his attempts to force them to practice godliness and to love one another .
Others simply voted with their feet by moving to neighboring Connecticut to pursue their own interests .
Frankly , the results have been disappointing .
Will there ever be a God - fearing society that is prosperous both materially and spiritually ? ” The Bible answers those questions , as the following article shows .
[ Footnote ]
It clearly shows how Jehovah maneuvers matters to have his will accomplished .
It is also the story of a strong and courageous leader .
Since the Babylonian scribes customarily counted the years of the Persian kings ’ reign from Nisan ( March / April ) to Nisan , Artaxerxes ’ first regnal year began in Nisan of 474 B.C.E .
For burden bearers this would not be a problem .
5 : 7 ​ — In what sense did Nehemiah begin “ finding fault with the nobles and the deputy rulers ” ?
Perhaps he hoped that this would anger Nehemiah so much that he would leave the building work and come to defend himself .
1 : 4 ; 4 : 19 , 20 ; 6 : 3 , 15 .
While Nehemiah was a man of tender feelings , he set a fine example as a man of action who was firm for righteousness .
Nehemiah’s main source of joy was not his prestigious position as a cupbearer .
2 : 4 - 8 .
“ A king’s heart is as streams of water in the hand of Jehovah , ” says Proverbs 21 : 1 .
Rather , we can imitate the common Tekoites who willingly expended themselves .
We can do so by participating in Kingdom Hall construction work and disaster relief efforts but primarily by sharing in the Kingdom - preaching work .
4 : 14 .
When faced with opposition , we too can overcome fear by keeping in our mind “ the great and the fear - inspiring One . ”
For Christian overseers , Governor Nehemiah is a splendid example of humility , unselfishness , and discretion .
Since Jerusalem is still underpopulated , lots are cast to have 1 of every 10 men living outside the city move into the city .
Next , the wall is inaugurated with such spirit that “ the rejoicing of Jerusalem [ can ] be heard far away . ”
7 : 6 - 67 ​ — Why does Nehemiah’s list of the remnant who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel differ from Ezra’s in individual figures for each household ?
10 : 34 ​ — Why were the people required to supply wood ?
The wood offering was not commanded in the Mosaic Law .
Hence , lots were cast to ensure a continuous supply of wood .
Many had taken foreign wives , and their offspring did not even speak the language of the Jews .
For conditions to deteriorate so much , Nehemiah must have been gone for a long time .
Nehemiah ‘ called down evil upon them ’ in that he recited against them the judgments found in God’s Law .
Lessons for Us :
11 : 2 .
12 : 31 , 38 , 40 - 42 .
We should sing wholeheartedly at Christian gatherings .
13 : 22 .
We too need to be aware of our accountability to Jehovah .
The lesson for us is clear .
Can we really expect Jehovah to bless us unless we give true worship the first place in our lives ?
Imitate the Patience of Jehovah
What he offers is the gift of everlasting life ​ — for most of us , endless life on a paradise earth .
( b ) What questions will we now consider ?
How do we know that Jehovah’s patience is not limitless ?
Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise , as some people consider slowness , but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance . ”
The first point is that Jehovah does not view time as we do .
It is , of course , not easy to wait for something that one yearns for .
How unwise it would be to think that of God !
If we mistake God’s patience for slowness , the passing of time can easily cause us to give way to doubt and discouragement , and we risk becoming spiritually drowsy .
How is Jehovah’s patience related to his desire that people repent ?
The patience of God is also seen in his dealings with the ancient nation of Israel .
Finally , Jehovah sent his Son , who tirelessly appealed to the Jews to become reconciled to God .
With full knowledge that he was soon to be put to death , Jesus lamented : “ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her , ​ — how often I wanted to gather your children together , the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings !
Jesus , like his Father in heaven , wanted the people to repent and escape adverse judgment .
In what way has the patience of God benefited us ?
Are we not grateful that Jehovah’s patience has opened the way to salvation for us ?
We too do not desire any to be destroyed but would like to see them repent and share our hope of everlasting life . ​ — 1 Timothy 2 : 3 , 4 .
We learn from God’s servants of old .
Despite the unresponsiveness of the people , Isaiah patiently declared Jehovah’s warning messages for no less than 46 years !
14 , 15 .
He suffered this abuse at the hands of the very people whom he wished to help .
He continued : “ In my heart [ the word of God ] proved to be like a burning fire shut up in my bones ; and I got tired of holding in , and I was unable to endure it . ”
Moreover , Jehovah was with Jeremiah “ like a terrible mighty one , ” strengthening him to proclaim the word of God with zeal and boldness . ​ — Jeremiah 20 : 11 .
Did the prophet Jeremiah find joy in his work ?
Absolutely !
We too can rejoice .
Job did not suffer in silence ; he lamented his situation and even implied that he was more righteous than God .
What do we learn from the patient endurance of Job ?
Yet , of this we may be sure : If we remain faithful , we will be blessed .
Jehovah without fail rewards those earnestly seeking him .
There are limits to his patience .
Wrote Peter : “ [ God ] did not hold back from punishing an ancient world . ”
How did Jehovah reward Jeremiah’s patience ?
JESUS ’ words recorded at Matthew 24 : 14 are so familiar that many of us know them by heart .
Though they delighted in the precious truths that Jesus had taught them , they were well - aware that not all shared their delight .
Jesus had powerful and influential enemies .
Still others , in fact “ the greater number , ” would allow their love for God and for his Word to cool off . ​ — Matthew 24 : 9 - 12 .
Why are Jesus ’ words found at Matthew 24 : 14 truly stunning ?
These are matters for Jehovah alone to determine .
Those early disciples could hardly have envisioned the magnitude of the witness that would be given in this time of the end .
On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , about 120 disciples were in an upper room in Jerusalem .
When the apostles and older men in Judaea discerned that the good news was also to be taken to those of the nations ​ — non - Jews — ​ they glorified God .
Some years later , possibly about 58 C.E . , there were in addition to Gentile believers “ many thousands of [ Jewish ] believers . ” ​ — Acts 21 : 20 .
It dramatically changed the lives of those embracing it .
The early Christians did not take credit for what was being accomplished .
Consequently , in harmony with Jesus ’ admonition , they exerted themselves vigorously in the work they were assigned to do . ​ — Luke 13 : 24 .
As “ an apostle to the nations , ” Paul journeyed thousands of miles on land and sea , establishing many congregations in the Roman province of Asia and in Greece .
Another woman , named Persis , is said to have “ performed many labors in the Lord . ” ​ — Romans 16 : 12 .
Yet , Jehovah had determined that a far greater witness would be given before he would bring an end to Satan’s global system of things .
By the year 1914 , there were about 5,100 who actively participated in the preaching activity , and the good news had reached some 68 lands .
That issue of The Watch Tower further stated : “ In 1920 , . . .
What was accomplished in the past service year ?
( See chart on pages 27 - 30 . )
Millions of return visits were made , and millions of Bible studies were conducted .
Though nearly 2,000 years have passed since Jesus said that the good news would be preached , the zeal that God’s people have for the work has not diminished .
Aglow with God’s spirit , Jehovah’s Witnesses zealously continue to proclaim the good news to the ends of the earth .
He progressed toward dedication and baptism and is now a regular pioneer and a ministerial servant .
There is no doubt that Jehovah is rocking the nations by means of the global witness being given , and the desirable things ​ — people — ​ are coming in .
Pedro , who lives in Portugal , entered a seminary when he was 13 years old .

Are You Like a Lagani Auna Tree ?
As they walked , they saw a beautiful tree .
Though it loses its flowers and leaves during the dry season , the tree stores a supply of water .
Its root system is strong and can grow around rocks that are deep underground .
Jehovah is a God of purpose .
Then , through this Son , Jehovah created a family of spirit sons and eventually the physical universe , including the earth and man upon it . ​ — Job 38 : 4 , 7 ; Psalm 103 : 19 - 21 ; John 1 : 2 , 3 ; Colossians 1 : 15 , 16 .
Jehovah did not create the earth as a testing ground to enlarge his family of spirit sons in heaven , as taught by many churches of Christendom .
He created it with a definite purpose in mind , for it “ to be inhabited . ”
Satan cast doubt on the motive of Jehovah’s creatures in submitting to Him and serving Him .
Jehovah’s “ good pleasure , ” or purpose , would be fulfilled by means of “ an administration . ”
The covenant with David showed that the Seed would be the Head of a Kingdom to time indefinite .
Once the Law covenant led the Jews to the Messiah , Jehovah revealed further aspects of the fulfillment of his purpose .
Jehovah sent the angel Gabriel to tell Mary that she would give birth to a son who was to be called Jesus .
The identity of the promised Seed thus became clear . ​ — Galatians 3 : 16 ; 4 : 4 .
Jehovah’s only - begotten Son was to come to earth and be tested to the limit .
The perfect answer to Satan’s challenge would be in Jesus ’ hands .
Yes , by his unflinching integrity until his death , Jesus provided the definitive answer to Satan’s challenge .
12 , 13 . ( a ) What is one aspect of “ the sacred secret of the kingdom of God ” ?
( a ) How were non - Jews involved in “ the sacred secret of the kingdom of God ” ?
Paul explained this facet of Jehovah’s “ administration , ” or way of managing the fulfillment of his purpose : “ In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit , namely , that people of the nations should be joint heirs and fellow members of the body and partakers with us of the promise in union with Christ Jesus through the good news . ”
“ The hundred and forty - four thousand ” seen standing with “ the Lamb ” on heavenly Mount Zion are said to have been “ bought from the earth , ” “ bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb , ” Christ Jesus .
By his incomparably wise “ administration , ” or way of managing things , Jehovah sent his firstborn Son to earth , where he was tested to the limit .
Furthermore , Jehovah determined that the Messianic Kingdom government of his Son would include humans who had also upheld His sovereignty until death . ​ — Ephesians 1 : 8 - 12 ; Revelation 2 : 10 , 11 .
Why can we be glad that Christ and his associate rulers once lived as humans ?
Jehovah showed his great love for Adam’s descendants by having his Son come to the earth and by selecting from among mankind those who would be the Son’s joint heirs in the Kingdom government .
How could that benefit others who have proved faithful to Jehovah , from Abel onward ?
We perceive that this fits into Jehovah’s marvelous “ administration ” of things for the fulfilling of his purpose .
This also helps us to understand why only a few Christians attending the Lord’s Evening Meal partake of the emblems .
In the following article , we will see what the Memorial of Christ’s death means to those Christians whose hope is heavenly .
• Why did Jehovah create the earth and put man upon it ?
Gathering Things in Heaven and Things on Earth
UNIVERSAL PEACE !
Bible scholar J .
Who are “ the things in the heavens ” that need to be gathered ?
“ The things in the heavens ” mentioned by Paul in his letter to the Ephesians are to be gathered “ in the Christ . ”
They are the limited number of humans chosen to rule with Christ in the heavens .
How can it be said that anointed ones are ‘ seated in the heavenly places ’ even while on earth ?
Anointed Christians are brought forth , or born again , by the holy spirit to become Jehovah’s spiritual sons .
As such , even while on earth , they are said to be ‘ raised up and seated together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus . ’
On the night that Jesus instituted the Memorial of his death , he told his faithful apostles : “ You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials ; and I make a covenant with you , just as my Father has made a covenant with me , for a kingdom , that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel . ”
Those of this limited group forgo all hopes of living forever on earth as humans of flesh and blood .
Yes , Paul was willing to submit himself “ to a death like his . ”
Many anointed Christians have endured in their fleshly bodies “ the death - dealing treatment given to Jesus . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 10 .
He was referring to his literal body , soon to be beaten and bloodied .
Because in the Bible , leaven can denote sin or wickedness .
His doing so would benefit all faithful Christians , whether they hoped for life in heaven or everlasting life on a paradise earth . ​ — John 6 : 51 .
Yes , it is with his shed blood that Christ “ bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation , and . . . made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God , and they are to rule as kings over the earth . ” ​ — Revelation 5 : 9 , 10 .
Partaking of the Emblems
Those with an earthly hope discern that they themselves are not anointed members of the body of Christ , nor are they in the new covenant that Jehovah made with those who will rule with Jesus Christ .
Those looking forward to everlasting life in human perfection on earth under the Kingdom are neither baptized into Jesus ’ death nor called to rule with him in heaven .
Thus , they do not partake , though they do attend the Memorial as respectful observers .
The final sealing of the 144,000 will clear the way for the unleashing of the “ winds ” of destruction against Satan’s wicked system of things on earth .
Those proving faithful will be adopted as earthly “ children of God . ” ​ — Ephesians 1 : 10 ; Romans 8 : 21 ; Revelation 20 : 7 , 8 .
Thus , by means of his infinitely wise “ administration , ” or way of managing things , Jehovah will have fulfilled his purpose “ to gather all things together again in the Christ , the things in the heavens and the things on the earth . ”
They will observe the Memorial of Christ’s death , even as Jesus commanded : “ Keep doing this in remembrance of me . ”

Enlightenment Leads to Organizational Refinements
Just as replacing an inferior material with a superior one denotes improvement , Jehovah’s Witnesses have experienced improvements in their organizational arrangements all through “ the conclusion of the system of things , ” or “ the last days . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 3 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 1 .
Because Sunday was the day when most people were off work .
Increased Light Means Further Improvements
What refinement came about in 1938 ?
In 1938 the use of elections was eliminated altogether .
In 1972 , what arrangement was instituted , and why was that an improvement ?
The arrangement of oversight by a body of elders was instituted in the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide , replacing oversight by just one congregation servant , or overseer .
What arrangement was implemented in 1976 ?
The year 1992 saw still another refinement , one that is comparable to what happened after the Israelites and others returned from exile in Babylon .
Back at that time , there were not a sufficient number of Levites to care for temple service .
They were appointed as helpers to the Governing Body committees . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
In the 1920 ’ s , how did Jehovah illuminate the path of his people doctrinally ?
Jehovah is also progressively illuminating the path of his people doctrinally .
For years , the Bible Students had known that the great multitude , or the “ great crowd , ” spoken of at Revelation 7 : 9 - 17 was different from the 144,000 , who would rule with Christ as kings and priests .
Later in the same year came a clarification that affected school - age children of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a number of countries .
In the following year , another doctrinal truth , that Christ died on a stake , not a cross , was explained . ​ — Acts 10 : 39 .
When was the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures released , and what are two outstanding features of it ?
In 1946 a need was seen for a fresh Bible translation that took advantage of the latest scholarship and was not tainted by dogmas based on traditions of Christendom .
In 1950 the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released in English .
In the years that followed , the path of the righteous ones continued to get brighter and brighter .
And in 2002 further discernment was gained regarding what it means to worship God “ with spirit and truth . ” ​ — John 4 : 24 .
Yet , divine light surely helps us to avoid them so that we can continue walking in the path of increasing light .
• Increased light has brought about what doctrinal refinements ?
• What adjustments have you personally witnessed , and what has helped you to accept them ?
The “ New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures ” released in 1950 , by N . H .
The massacre of the Jews will be thorough and efficient .
That is what the planner of the scheme thinks .
This dramatic narrative shows how Jehovah saves his people from the evil designs of their enemies , even though his servants are widely dispersed throughout a vast empire .
When they gladly attend , Esther petitions them to come for another banquet the next day .
However , he is infuriated by Mordecai’s refusal to honor him .
Perhaps the king used this lengthy event to show off the glory of his kingdom in order to impress the nobles and convince them of his ability to carry out his plans .
The account says that in the morning the other women brought to the king were returned to the second house under the charge of the king’s eunuch , “ the guardian of the concubines . ”
How did she gain Ahasuerus ’ “ favor and loving - kindness ” ?
Similarly , the king was impressed with what he saw in Esther and therefore came to love her .
However , in the case of Haman , more was involved .
Haman was an Agagite , probably an Amalekite , and Jehovah had marked Amalek for extermination .
Esther and Mordecai were good examples of “ subjection to the superior authorities . ” ​ — Romans 13 : 1 .
4 : 16 .
What about the planned massacre of the Jews ?
That too must undergo a dramatic reversal .
Faithful Esther speaks up again .
Ahasuerus knows what needs to be done .
Mordecai decrees that the Festival of Purim be held each year to commemorate this great deliverance .
“ Pride is before a crash , and a haughty spirit before stumbling . ” ​ — Proverbs 16 : 18 .
8 : 3 - 6 .
9 : 22 .
“ In the final part of the days , ” or in the final part of the time of the end , Gog of Magog ​ — Satan the Devil — ​ will make an all - out attack on Jehovah’s people .
But as in Esther’s day , Jehovah will provide “ relief and deliverance ” for his worshippers . ​ — Ezekiel 38 : 16 - 23 ; Esther 4 : 14 . [ Picture on page 10 ]
Wise King Solomon wrote : “ I have come to know that there is nothing better . . . than to rejoice . . . and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work .
Of course , the Creator’s providing so abundantly does not give us license to engage in unrestrained merriment .
Most of what the world offers is designed to appeal to “ fleshly desires . ”
From what do we receive our greatest refreshment ?
Paul said that “ mature people . . . through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ”
Jehovah hates those “ loving violence . ”
Be assured that satisfying recreation can be found , but it takes effort .
Picnics , appropriate games , camping trips , or hikes can be arranged .
11 , 12 . ( a ) What can you do to include others in your plans for occasional recreation ?
You might also include a few who are newly associated , being careful , of course , not to expose others to any harmful influence .
If infirm ones find it difficult to go out , perhaps arrangements can be made to bring a meal to share with them in their home . ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1 , 2 .
Gatherings at which guests enjoy a simple meal , hear how others became Christians , and learn what has helped them to stay faithful to God have proved unforgettable for many .
Such discussions can be profitable interchanges of encouragement without anyone having to feel uncomfortable or inadequate .
At a time that does not interfere with spiritual activities , a few families may decide to enjoy a picnic together or play a game that is not overly competitive .
When some of the elders , ministerial servants , or other mature ones are present at a social gathering , they provide an influence for good and the occasion can be even more refreshing .
Why should hosting an event include proper supervision ?
At social gatherings , those making the arrangements should not overlook the need for proper supervision .
Why ?
In a similar way , what you do ​ — without imposing unreasonable restrictions — ​ to protect your guests at a social gathering should be with their physical and spiritual interests at heart .
There is a need for being selective .
Be careful that you do not leave the choice of music to someone who has yet to appreciate the need for keeping the volume at a moderate level .
Jehovah does not deny us this pleasure , but realistically we know that such activities do not in themselves help us to store up any spiritual treasures in heaven .
Jesus helped his disciples to understand that “ seeking first the kingdom and [ God’s ] righteousness ” is the important thing in life , not what we may eat or drink or wear , “ things the nations are eagerly pursuing . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 31 - 34 .
Faithful servants of Jehovah can anticipate what good things from the Grand Provider ?
• What are some forms of recreation that have proved to be satisfying for Christian families ?
Choose recreation that produces good fruitage
Eventually , he and his daughters were reduced to living in a cave .
What had looked so good to him at the outset turned out to be just the opposite .
Why is there a need for caution if we are approached with a business opportunity ?
He is enthusiastic about the prospects for success and encourages you to act quickly so as not to miss out .
Such an examination often reveals hidden dangers .
The offer may sound tempting , but what are the risks ?
( a ) What wise step did Jeremiah take when he bought a field ?
( b ) Why is it beneficial to document all business arrangements in a formal written agreement ?
When the prophet Jeremiah bought a field from his cousin , who was a fellow worshipper of Jehovah , he made a written record of the transaction before witnesses .
We must also guard against greed .
God’s Word cautions us : “ Let your manner of life be free of the love of money , while you are content with the present things . ”
When contemplating a business opportunity , a Christian should consider , ‘ Is it really necessary to get involved ? ’
( a ) What challenges do many single Christians face ?
Many servants of Jehovah long to be married but have not yet found a suitable mate .
What pressure did a Shulammite girl come under , and how might Christian women today face a similar challenge ?
( See also the box on page 25 . )
Internet Web sites designed to help single individuals find a marriage partner are becoming popular .
Have you done that recently ?
By our sincere interest , may we show that we appreciate these loyal ones as Jehovah does . ​ — Psalm 37 : 28 .
What challenges do serious health problems present ?
How distressing it is when we or a loved one faces serious health problems !
What can help us to keep our senses completely ?
“ The shrewd one considers his steps ” by doing research in the Bible and Christian publications .
Is the treatment based on the belief that sickness and death are caused either by offended gods ( or ancestral spirits ) or by enemies who employ witchcraft ?
Are sacrifices , incantations , or other spiritistic rituals employed in the preparation or use of the medicine ?
13 , 14 . ( a ) How can we demonstrate reasonableness in caring for our physical health ?
( b ) Why is reasonableness needed when we discuss health and medical matters with others ?
We must guard against becoming so preoccupied with physical health that our more important spiritual needs get pushed aside . ​ — Matthew 5 : 3 ; Philippians 1 : 10 .
Furthermore , medical decisions often involve Bible principles , a person’s conscience , and his relationship with Jehovah .
What can help us to avoid acting rashly ?
Further , God’s Word admonishes us : “ Be agitated , but do not sin . Have your say in your heart , upon your bed , and keep silent . ”
In spite of our best efforts to avoid dangers and act wisely , all of us make mistakes .
We could be about to take a ruinous false step and be completely unaware of it .
More than that , as human creatures , we have neither the ability nor the right to direct our own step apart from Jehovah .

“ Tell Us More ! ”
IN Nezlobnaya , Russia , a high school literature class was studying the works of the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov .
In his essay , Andrey explained that while he respects the opinion of others , he has found that the best way to learn about Jesus is to read one of the four Gospel accounts .
Andrey added : “ Another concern is how Satan is portrayed .
Andrey’s teacher was so pleased with the essay that she invited him to prepare an oral report on Jesus Christ .
He explained why he felt that Jesus is the greatest man who ever lived .
Then he read a chapter about Jesus ’ death from the Bible book of Matthew .
“ I had prayed to Jehovah for wisdom , and he answered my prayer , ” says Andrey .
As a part of the inspired Word of God , the message of the book of Job is alive and exerts power even today . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
The seven sons of Job apparently held a seven - day family gathering once a year .
Lessons for Us :
Like Job , we should remain firm in faith even if family members do not value our spiritual pursuits or pressure us to compromise or give up our faith .
Eliphaz takes the lead .
Job does not accept the false reasoning of his visitors .
7 : 9 , 10 ; 10 : 21 ; 16 : 22 ​ — Do these statements indicate that Job did not believe in the resurrection ?
What , then , did he mean ?
That Job hoped in a future resurrection is clear from Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
10 : 10 ​ — How did Jehovah ‘ pour Job out as milk and curdle him like cheese ’ ?
This is a poetic description of how Job was formed in his mother’s womb .
19 : 20 ​ — What did Job mean by the expression “ I escape with the skin of my teeth ” ?
By saying that he escaped with the skin of something that apparently has no skin , Job might have been saying that he escaped with practically nothing .
We must not quickly assume that a person in distress is reaping what he has sown and does not have God’s approval .
4 : 18 , 19 ; 22 : 2 , 3 .
Our words should encourage and strengthen others , not irritate them . ​ — Proverbs 18 : 21 .
A young bystander named Elihu has patiently been listening to the debate .
Job admits that he has spoken without understanding and says : “ I make a retraction , and I do repent in dust and ashes . ”
In his distressed state , Job was inclined to take the ridicule of his three visitors as directed toward him , although they were really speaking against God .
Like Job , all those who love Jehovah will be tested .
What a grand hope is set before us ​ — everlasting life in Paradise on earth !

After putting forth some resistance , the governor proves reluctant to carry his load of responsibility and gives in to pressure .
Then he hands the man over to be impaled .
“ Each one will carry his own load , ” states the Bible .
Her action led Adam to join her .
Adam and Eve’s disobedience should teach us a vital lesson concerning man’s limitations : Unless he adheres to divine guidance , man is prone to make wrong decisions .
What guidance has Jehovah provided for us , and what must we do to benefit from it ?
We must study the Scriptures and acquire accurate knowledge of them .
To make correct choices , we should partake of “ solid food [ that ] belongs to mature people . ”
It can , in time , come to be marked “ as with a branding iron , ” becoming like seared flesh covered over with scar tissue ​ — insensitive and unresponsive .
On the other hand , a conscience trained by God’s Word is a safe guide .
What is a key requirement in making wise decisions ?
Explain .
Having our perceptive powers trained , however , we appreciate that it is one thing to have necessary limited contact with the world and quite another to cultivate close ties with it .
So true Christians do not accept jobs that may involve idolatry , stealing , misuse of blood , or other unscriptural practices .
What if the work itself does not specifically violate any divine requirement ?
In this case , we would need to consider such factors as the extent of our having authority over what is being done and the degree of our involvement .
And what about performing a legitimate service , such as delivering mail everywhere in a community , including places that promote wrong practices ?
In making decisions , what measures should we take ?
What about the decisions we make regarding other matters , such as pursuing secular education and accepting or rejecting certain medical treatment ?
What do we learn from the first - century Christians about making decisions ?
They could choose to eat certain foods that were considered unclean under the Law and were not objectionable in other ways .
How is prayer a help to us in making decisions ?
“ If any one of you is lacking in wisdom , ” says the disciple James , “ let him keep on asking God , for he gives generously to all and without reproaching ; and it will be given him . ”
What can be said about the outcome of a good decision ?
Adam and Eve’s disobedience teaches us a vital lesson

All members of the Governing Body are anointed Christians .
Ironically , it is religion ​ — specifically the religious organizations and leaders who have promoted ideas contrary to God’s thoughts .
What did God’s Law to ancient Israel say about false prophets ?
For instance , the Mosaic Law specifically warned God’s chosen people against false prophets .
Consider how the Bible book of Revelation describes false religion .
This figurative woman commits fornication with many kings and is drunk with the blood of God’s true worshippers .
How has false religion prostituted herself , and with what results ?
Resembling a woman not faithful to her marriage vows , false religion has prostituted herself by forming alliances with one political power after another .
African political analyst Dr . Xolela Mangcu observed that “ world history is littered with examples of mass killings caused by linking religion and politics . ”
How is Jehovah’s hatred for false worship expressed in the book of Revelation ?
Those who want to be spared must get out of false religion before it is too late .
What should we do to keep clear of false worship ?
Taking such measures protects us from being carried off by someone “ as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men , according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ . ” ​ — Colossians 2 : 8 .
It is especially important that the person take decisive action to avoid completely any kind of spiritual contamination from false worship .
Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever ?
The answer is no .
To be no part of the world is to remain “ without spot from the world . ”
“ Keep Holding the Pattern of Healthful Words ”
What deplorable spiritual condition is experienced by those who regress to false worship ?
Those who do not keep clear of false worship can be “ tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men , by means of cunning in contriving error . ” ​ — Ephesians 4 : 13 , 14 .
• What dangers to our spirituality should we avoid ?
Do you know why “ Babylon the Great ” is portrayed as an immoral woman ?
A Night to Remember
On the night before he died , Jesus Christ instituted the Memorial of his death .
Jesus said : “ Man must live , not on bread alone , but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth . ”
For example , you may need help with texts that refer to unfamiliar customs or that use figurative expressions .
Even so , you really can come to understand the Bible .
A Pleasure Open to All
In it God expresses his will to us .
Christ Jesus said : “ Which father is there among you who , if his son asks for a fish , will perhaps hand him a serpent instead of a fish ?
Or if he also asks for an egg , will hand him a scorpion ?
Understanding the Bible ​ — What Will Help You ?
How , then , can you acquire the attitude needed to understand the Bible ?
Preparing the Heart and the Mind
We must pray for such help .
Notice how this was the concern of the psalmist who wrote : “ Make me understand , that I may observe your law and that I may keep it with the whole heart . ”
We need to pray not only for the mental ability to comprehend what is written but also for the heart attitude that will allow us to accept it .
Thus , the Bible encourages us to assess carefully what we have been taught . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 21 .
She was brought up according to Jewish tradition .
Consequently , Mary accepted Jesus ’ teaching and was among the first members of the Christian congregation .
If we are to benefit from the Bible , like Mary we must place loyalty to God before loyalty to anyone else .
Some are content to follow religious traditions that are based on falsehood .
Nevertheless , the wise man wrote : “ Buy truth itself and do not sell it . ”
As the psalmist Asaph acknowledged , however , the Israelites “ did not keep the covenant of God , and in his law they refused to walk . ”
What steps must one take to enjoy a personal relationship with God ?
To be among those who enjoy that precious relationship with God , one must make a dedication to Jehovah and symbolize it publicly by water baptism .
The Israelites listened to a reading of “ the book of the covenant . ”
The apostle Paul explains : “ We all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh . ”
In other words , we say no to our selfish , imperfect inclinations and yes to God’s counsel and direction .
Interestingly , even some opposers recognize the dedication that Jehovah’s Witnesses have made to God to serve him unreservedly .
Surely this well expresses the attitude of all dedicated , faithful servants of God ! ​ — Acts 5 : 32 .
Identified as One of Jehovah’s Witnesses
After undergoing immersion , he becomes an ordained minister who bears Jehovah’s name .
Nevertheless , an obligation accompanies this honor .
( b ) What provisions are available to help us spiritually ?
We are not alone in serving God , and we need the help , support , and encouragement of “ the whole association of brothers . ”
We are drawn to Jehovah by his kind qualities and by the way he deals with us .
Jehovah gave his only - begotten Son for us and offers us the best possible future .
It expresses a resolve that takes priority over every other responsibility .
He himself will guide us until we die . ” ​ — Psalm 48 : 14 .
Might there be valid reasons for a person to hold back from getting baptized ?
• What does dedication to God involve ?
Meeting the Requirements for Christian Baptism
This devout man had journeyed all the way from Ethiopia to Jerusalem to worship Jehovah .
Hence , Philip was able to hear that he was reading from the scroll of Isaiah .
This led to a discussion of Isaiah 53 : 7 , 8 .
Finally , Philip “ declared to him the good news about Jesus . ” ​ — Acts 8 : 29 - 35 .
“ What prevents me from getting baptized ? ” he asked Philip upon sighting a convenient body of water .
Although the steps of dedication and baptism are not to be taken lightly or hastily , the example of the Ethiopian official shows that there have been occasions when individuals were baptized shortly after hearing the truth of God’s Word .
We are resolved to follow his ways and seek his guidance .
The apostle Peter urged those who heard him at Pentecost to “ be baptized . ”
( b ) What spiritual progress should young ones have made before baptism ?
Before getting baptized , however , a youngster should have a personal relationship with Jehovah , a sound understanding of the fundamentals of the Scriptures , and a clear comprehension of what dedication involves , as is the case with adults .
What steps must precede dedication and baptism ?
Jesus instructed his disciples to teach new ones all the things he had commanded .
Another important step in the progress toward baptism is that of sharing in preaching the Kingdom good news .
Sharing in this work also equips them for regular and zealous participation in the field ministry after baptism . ​ — Romans 10 : 9 , 10 , 14 , 15 .
Certain ones may hold back from baptism because they are reluctant to accept the responsibility it brings .
They realize that to meet Jehovah’s standards , they will have to make significant changes in their lives .
Or they may fear that they will find it difficult to live up to God’s requirements after baptism .
In Jesus ’ day , what held certain ones back from becoming Jesus ’ followers ?
Likely , he preferred to stay at home and wait until his father died rather than follow Jesus and care for that family responsibility when it came .
Finally , a third said that before following Jesus , he needed to “ say good - bye ” to his household .
For my yoke is kindly and my load is light . ”
While baptism does bring a yoke of responsibility , Jesus assures us that it is a kindly and bearable one that will refresh us immensely .
Love for God and trust in him can help us to overcome lingering doubts about whether we will be able to live up to our dedication .
Likewise , if we trust in Jehovah with all our heart , he promises to ‘ make our paths straight ’ as we walk alongside him . ​ — Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 .
The baptism itself is usually preceded by a Scriptural talk explaining the significance of Christian baptism .

The Bible shows that after getting baptized , Jesus “ came up from the water ” or “ out of the water . ”
And since the Bible urges us to dress with modesty in everyday life , how much more so should we heed this counsel on the day of our baptism !
What privileges and blessings does baptism bring ?
First of all , Jehovah becomes our Father and our Friend .
Furthermore , Jesus indicated that those who follow him “ will inherit everlasting life . ”
[ Footnotes ]
The three thousand Jews and proselytes who listened to Peter’s speech at Pentecost likewise got baptized without delay .
Can You Explain ?
• Why should we not allow fear of failure or reluctance to accept responsibility to hold us back from baptism ?
“ What prevents me from getting baptized ? ”
As evidenced by the fulfillment of Bible prophecy , since 1914 we have been in “ the Lord’s day . ”
You may well have studied this subject , so you know that Jesus compared “ the days of the Son of man ” in Kingdom power to “ the days of Noah ” and “ the days of Lot . ”
Yet , there is another parallel that deserves our serious consideration .
Haggai and Zechariah were ‘ messengers of Jehovah ’ to the Jews after their return from captivity in Babylon .
Why , though , can we be sure that these two books should be of concern to us today ?
There still is on earth today a remnant of anointed Christians , who are heirs of the Messianic Kingdom with Jesus .
5 , 6 .
After the Jews returned from captivity in Babylon in 537 B.C.E . , Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua ( or Jeshua ) supervised the laying of the foundation of the new temple in 536 B.C.E .
These opposers induced the king of Persia to ban the temple construction work . ​ — Ezra 4 : 10 - 21 .
Do you know the significance of all of this for us ?
We have work to do in connection with the preaching of the “ good news of the kingdom . ”
Just as the ancient Jews were released from literal captivity in Babylon , so Jehovah’s modern - day people were freed from captivity to Babylon the Great , the world empire of false religion .
God’s anointed ones applied themselves to the work of preaching , teaching , and directing people to true worship .
This God - ordained work must continue until Jehovah intervenes in human affairs at the “ great tribulation . ”
Why can we be confident of God’s backing on our work ?
There is still , though , much to do .
As noted , the Jews who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon did not persevere in their work on the temple .
What mistaken viewpoint had developed among them ?
How does Haggai 1 : 6 describe the situation of the Jews , and what does that verse mean ?
The Jews were in the land that God had given them , yet it was not producing as they would have liked .
14 , 15 .
The fancy houses and decorated furniture did not last .
It would be fitting for each of us to ask : ‘ Frankly , how much emphasis do I put on my home and its decoration ?
What about arranging for extra education to advance a career , though doing that would take up considerable time for a number of years , crowding out important aspects of my spiritual life ? ’ ​ — Luke 12 : 20 , 21 ; 1 Timothy 6 : 17 - 19 .
In its ancient context , what does Zechariah 4 : 6 mean ?
And this shows how he will bless you too .
You may often have heard this verse quoted , but what meaning did it have for the Jews in the days of Haggai and Zechariah , and thus what is its import for you ?
Through a series of eight visions , Zechariah was assured that Jehovah would be with his people , who would faithfully carry the temple work to a finish .
Did God’s spirit play a role in this ?
In the days of Haggai and Zechariah , Jehovah was going to cause another shake - up , as described in the figurative language of verses 6 and 7 .
That will be in order to overthrow and annihilate the strength of the kingdoms of the nations . ​ — Haggai 2 : 22 .
For one thing , Satan the Devil and his demons were hurled down to the vicinity of the earth .
Despite that , “ a great crowd ” of the desirable things of all the nations have joined spiritual Israel in serving Jehovah .
Jehovah’s people share in reaching ‘ desirable ones of the nations ’
“ Let the hands of you people be strong , you who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets . ” ​ — ZECHARIAH 8 : 9 .
THE prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah were written some 2,500 years ago , yet they certainly are relevant to your life .
On what do Haggai and Zechariah focus ?
The Jews laid the foundation of the temple in 536 B.C.E .
Soon after World War I , Jehovah’s anointed ones were released from captivity to Babylon the Great .
To what grand accomplishment does Zechariah 4 : 7 point ?
At Zechariah 4 : 7 , we read : “ He will certainly bring forth the headstone . There will be shoutings to it : ‘ How charming ! How charming ! ’ ”
Zechariah 4 : 7 is pointing to the time when true worship of the Sovereign Lord will be brought to its perfected state in the earthly courtyards of his spiritual temple .
At the end of the thousand years , only true worshippers of God will be left on the cleansed earth .
Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua were on hand to witness the temple’s completion in 515 B.C.E .
Unlike the Jews who said , “ The time has not come , ” we must remember that we are living in “ the last days . ”
Jesus foretold that his loyal followers would preach the good news of the Kingdom and make disciples .
The preaching and teaching work that was temporarily halted by the world’s opposition was resumed in 1919 , but it has not been completed .
You can be sure , though , that it certainly will be !
On what does Jehovah’s blessing depend , meaning what to us ?
Jehovah withdrew his blessing .
However , do you not see that from the standpoint of everlasting life , those really are “ dead works ” ?
You may know of some who were gradually distracted from Christian activities and from the congregation ; now they show no inclination to return to Jehovah’s service .
And imagine what a loss it would be not to share in the warm Christian brotherhood ! ​ — Galatians 1 : 6 ; 5 : 7 , 13 , 22 - 24 .
This is a very serious matter .
Obedient Jews who worked at rebuilding God’s temple were assured of divine backing , as God indicated through a series of eight visions that Zechariah received .
The first guaranteed the completion of the temple and prosperity for Jerusalem and Judah as long as the Jews obediently carried out the work at hand .
Ask yourself : ‘ If I believe that now is the time to do the work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom and making disciples , do my goals and lifestyle harmonize with my conviction ?
Am I spending an appropriate amount of time studying God’s prophetic Word , making it my concern , and conversing about it with fellow Christians as well as with others whom I meet ? ’
But it will mean continuous light and favor for Jehovah’s faithful worshippers .
Zechariah also described how everything in the new world will proclaim Jehovah’s holiness .
What a guarantee !
Following that stupendous accomplishment , Satan and his demons will be confined to an abyss of inactivity .
Zechariah 14 : 8 , 9 says : “ It must occur in that day that living waters will go forth from Jerusalem , half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea . In summer and in winter it will occur .
Thus will begin a new phase of Jehovah’s rulership over the earth .
Until true worship is brought to its perfected state , may we all strive to keep Kingdom interests in first place .
When it begins to get dark , he places a layer of cardboard under his cart and lies down to sleep .
He seems oblivious to the noise of cars and buses on the busy street where he spends the night .
Beggars ​ — the lame , the blind , women nursing their babies — ​ are a common sight .
The British magazine The Economist commented : “ The human race has never been richer , or better armed with the medical knowledge , technological prowess and intellectual firepower needed to beat poverty . ”
Shopping malls are full of the latest gadgets , and there is no lack of people to buy them .

If the majority of countries are reluctant to contribute , it is because the funds rarely reach the people for whom they are intended . ”
Unfortunately , because of corruption and bureaucratic red tape , a large part of the funds provided by governments , international agencies , and individuals never reaches the people who really need it .
The situation was no different when Jesus was on earth .
The religious leaders showed a complete lack of concern for the poor and needy .
The Gospel accounts of Jesus ’ life show that he fully comprehended the difficulties of the poor and was extremely sensitive to their needs .
Although Jesus had lived in heaven , he emptied himself , took up human life , and ‘ became poor for our sakes . ’
The account of the needy widow shows that Jesus was impressed , not by the large gifts of the rich , who gave “ out of their surplus , ” but by the poor widow’s tiny contribution .
What she did touched his heart because she “ out of her want dropped in all the means of living she had . ” ​ — Luke 21 : 4 .
They agreed that Paul and Barnabas should go to “ the nations , ” concentrating on the Gentiles in their preaching .
In response , Christians in Antioch “ determined , each of them according as anyone could afford it , to send a relief ministration to the brothers dwelling in Judea ; and this they did , dispatching it to the older men by the hand of Barnabas and Saul . ” ​ — Acts 11 : 28 - 30 .
In 1998 , for example , a severe drought ravaged much of northeastern Brazil .
The drought destroyed the rice , bean , and maize crops , leading to widespread famine ​ — the worst in 15 years .
In some places , even drinking water came to be in short supply .
I do not know what would have happened to me if I had not received help from my fellow Witnesses . ”
Why did Jesus interrupt his work in behalf of the sick and needy in order to resume his preaching activity ?
However , also like Jesus , they make the work of teaching the Bible’s message about the good news of God’s Kingdom their top priority .
What hope is that ?
When the Bible speaks of “ the earth , ” it is at times referring to the people who live on the earth .
So the righteous “ new earth ” that is promised to come is a society of people who have God’s approval .
PEACE : “ In his days the righteous one will sprout , and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more . ”
Much of the poverty in the world results from human conflicts and war .
[ Picture on page 6 ]
The Bible’s message brings real hope
SOME time before Pentecost 33 C.E . , Peter and six other disciples were eating a breakfast that Jesus had prepared on the shores of the Sea of Galilee .
Jehovah has deep affection for these men , considering them “ worthy of double honor . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 5 : 17 .
How do spiritual shepherds maintain a willing and eager spirit ?
He surrendered his soul in its behalf , and he knows each sheep personally , “ by name . ” ​ — John 10 : 3 , 14 - 16 .
Their Bible - based talks help feed and protect the flock , and their hard work in this regard is visible to all .
It is truly a labor of love . ​ — Galatians 5 : 13 .
One way shepherds become better acquainted with individual sheep is by working side by side with them in the public preaching work .
Hearing of your joy will encourage them .
Learning about your trials will enable them to strengthen and comfort you . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 1 : 6 ; 3 : 1 - 3 .
She says : “ My husband was always very busy caring for the congregation .
But he made me feel that I was part of a team .
( b ) What issue threatened the peace of the first - century congregation , and how was that issue resolved ?
After praying for holy spirit , they base their decisions on Bible principles and on guidelines published by “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
Jesus was long - suffering and kind in his dealings with the apostles , despite their repeated failings .
Is it not the one reclining at the table ?
However , keeping in mind his own failings as he ‘ admonishes the disorderly , ’ he is able to show long - suffering and kindness toward his brother . That way he imitates Jesus and Jehovah , who show these qualities toward all Christians ​ — including shepherds . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 14 ; James 2 : 13 .
A kind manner on the part of the shepherds may make it easier for a straying sheep eventually to return to the fold . ​ — Luke 15 : 11 - 24 .
Good Acts Are Motivated by Faith
In doing so , wise shepherds imitate the apostle Paul .
When he was betrayed and arrested , Jesus displayed mildness and great self - control .
( b ) What questions will we consider next ?
Without a doubt , Jehovah and Jesus appreciate the hard work of the thousands of shepherds who willingly tend the worldwide flock .
. . and in the ministry
Good communication among the elders promotes joy and peace in the congregation
The apostle Paul reminded the elders from Ephesus of one reason when , quoting Jesus , he said : “ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ”
Why may some hesitate to reach out for congregation privileges ?
As a baptized brother , are you among those who feel this way ?
Such concerns are not groundless .
How does Jehovah assist those whom he appoints to care for his sheep ?
How does he do this ?
How did these ordinary men become such extraordinary teachers ?
After listening to Peter and John , the court “ began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus . ”
Paul did not seek to make Timothy or any other person a disciple of himself .
Rather , he encouraged fellow believers to become ‘ imitators of him , even as he was of Christ . ’ ​ — 1 Corinthians 11 : 1 .
In imitation of Jesus and Paul , experienced shepherds take the initiative to train baptized brothers , with similar good results .
Because my father was an unbeliever , those elders showed a particular interest in me and became like spiritual fathers to me .
They must be “ tested as to fitness first . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 3 : 1 - 10 .
How can shepherds train others for further privileges ?
How , specifically , can experienced shepherds train others to care for congregational privileges ?
Mature shepherds discuss with those brothers the joys to be derived from serving others and the satisfaction they themselves receive from setting and attaining spiritual goals .
They also kindly offer specific suggestions on how a brother can improve in becoming an ‘ example to the flock . ’ ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 3 , 5 .
Learning how to use the Scriptures in such a way that they touch the heart is essential if a servant is to become an effective shepherd . ” ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 ; 5 : 14 .
I learned a lot from observing the humble and respectful way they dealt with the brothers and sisters in the congregation .
These elders impressed upon me the need to use the Bible skillfully when handling problems or when giving encouragement . ”
Trained by God’s Word
He was the most knowledgeable , the most discerning , and the wisest spiritual shepherd ever to walk the earth ; yet , even he did not rely on his own wisdom when teaching Jehovah’s sheep .
How do shepherds avoid seeking their own glory ?
During these last days of this system , the number of Christ’s brothers left on earth has inevitably declined .
How does the slave class provide this training ?
[ Footnote ]
Christian elders train younger men in the congregation
From our vantage point in history , we can review the overwhelming evidence confirming that Christ began to rule as Messianic King in heaven in 1914 .
( a ) The good news of the Kingdom has taken on what new aspect since 1914 ?
( b ) What questions can we ask ourselves ?
Christ has actively been ruling as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom , although “ in the midst of [ his ] enemies . ”
Spirit - anointed Christians , “ sons of the kingdom , ” serve as “ ambassadors substituting for Christ . ”
Additionally , having knowledge of Jesus ’ life on earth enables us to get to know his qualities as earth’s future Ruler ​ — most notably his self - sacrificing love .
Jesus Christ alone founded his kingdom upon love , and at this day millions of men would die for him . ”
Because Jesus was mild - tempered and lowly in heart , those who were weighed down with pressures and burdens were refreshed by his upbuilding teachings and kind personality .
What tender emotions did Jesus reveal when Lazarus died ?
He “ became troubled ” ​ — agitated by great heartache and sorrow — ​ even though he knew that he was shortly going to bring Lazarus back to life .
( See also box on page 31 . )
But what is required to be a subject of Christ the King ?
How can we show that we are loyal to Christ ?
Just as prospective citizens of a country abide by the laws of their new land , Christ’s subjects submit themselves to “ the law of the Christ ” by harmonizing their lives with all that Jesus taught and commanded .
If we love only those who love us , we would not be doing any “ extraordinary thing . ”
Jesus urged us to imitate his Father’s love by having principled love even for enemies who hate and persecute us .
This love also moves subjects of the Kingdom to persevere loyally in their main work .
What is that ?
Subjects of God’s Kingdom now have the crucial work of “ bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God . ”
When we preach the good news , hearers have the opportunity to become subjects of God’s Kingdom .
Of course , Satan resists the preaching work in any way he can , and human rulers do not acknowledge Christ’s God - given authority .
Christ’s followers , therefore , find themselves in a spiritual warfare that puts their loyalty to the test . ​ — 2 Corinthians 10 : 3 - 5 ; Ephesians 6 : 10 - 12 .
Christ’s subjects , therefore , obey governmental laws that do not conflict with God’s laws .
However , when the Jewish high court went against God’s laws by ordering Jesus ’ disciples to stop preaching , they firmly but respectfully said that they had to “ obey God as ruler rather than men . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 8 ; 5 : 27 - 32 .
Naturally , it takes much courage for Christ’s subjects to remain loyal to their King in the face of persecution .
Nevertheless , Jesus said : “ Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake .
Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens . ”
When he was still King - Designate , Jesus explained to the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate : “ My kingdom is no part of this world .
Subjects of the heavenly Kingdom , therefore , neither take up arms against anyone nor take sides in any human conflict .
Everlasting Rewards for Loyal Subjects
They eagerly anticipate his imminent demonstration of supernatural kingly power .
The remnant of loyal , spirit - anointed “ sons of the kingdom ” look forward to their priceless inheritance as kings with Christ in heaven .

2 : 7 ​ — What is “ the decree of Jehovah ” ?
In Bible times , kissing was an expression of friendship and faithfulness .
This term is generally thought to represent a pause for silent meditation , either in the singing alone or in the singing and instrumental music .
There is no need to read the word aloud during public reading of the Psalms .
These are the very foundations on which human society rests ​ — law , order , and justice .

David was under such intense pressure from his enemies that his ‘ heart became like wax and melted deep in his inward parts . ’

When angry or wrathful , we are wise to hold our tongue so as not to say something we will regret later . ​ — Ephesians 4 : 26 .
True worshippers must speak the truth and avoid false oaths and slander .
As Jehovah’s worshippers , we need to guard against misuse of money .
17 : 14 , 15 .
David’s main concern in life was to make a good name with God so as to ‘ behold his face , ’ or to experience Jehovah’s favor .
How valuable the advice given in Psalm 37 was to the Israelites and is to us , living as we do in “ the last days ” of this system of things !
The final psalm of the collection is about David’s request for Jehovah’s help during the turbulent years following his sin with Bath - sheba .
We march around Jehovah’s altar by exercising faith in that sacrifice .
Since a haughty person does not turn back from his wrong course , he is rewarded exceedingly with severe punishment . ​ — Proverbs 11 : 31 ; 1 Peter 4 : 18 .
We are wise to avoid association with those who hide their identity in Internet chat rooms , those at school or at our place of work who pretend to be our friends for devious reasons , apostates who put on a mask of sincerity , and those who live a double life .
We must praise Jehovah publicly at Christian gatherings .
Do we love to attend Christian meetings ?
While expressing his determination to keep his integrity , David also made a request for redemption .

“ Go , you and all your household , into the ark , because you are the one I have seen to be righteous before me among this generation . ” ​ — GENESIS 7 : 1 .
( b ) With what confidence did Noah enter the ark ?
Building the ark was no small task .
Finally , God’s patience with that wicked world ran out . ​ — Genesis 6 : 3 ; 1 Peter 3 : 20 .
With faith and confidence in Jehovah’s word , “ Noah went in , and his sons and his wife and his sons ’ wives with him . ”
Jehovah shut the door in order to protect his worshippers .
Modern Parallels to Noah’s Day
4 , 5 . ( a ) To what did Jesus compare the time of his presence ?
“ Just as the days of Noah were , so the presence of the Son of man will be . ”
Here , too , we see a parallel to our day .
( b ) What examples show that Jehovah’s Witnesses are generally recognized as being different ?
Noah’s contemporaries failed to appreciate that Noah had divine backing and was acting at God’s direction .
What these observers overlook is that the Witnesses manifest such qualities as love , peace , kindness , goodness , mildness , and self - control because they are led by God’s holy spirit .
This should add credibility to their message .
The worker asked him , “ If I said no , would you believe me ? ”
The man quickly replied , “ Not really . ”
They also exercised faith in the Universal Sovereign , Jehovah God .
“ Without faith it is impossible to please [ Jehovah ] well , ” wrote the apostle Paul , “ for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ”
Similarly , the cities of refuge in ancient Israel provided protection for the unintentional manslayer only if he first fled to such a city and then remained inside it until the death of the high priest .
In the tenth plague upon Egypt in Moses ’ day , the firstborn of the Egyptians were killed , but those of the Israelites were spared .
Jehovah had instructed Moses : “ They [ the Israelites ] must take some of the blood [ of the Passover lamb ] and splash it upon the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway belonging to the houses in which they will eat it . . . .
We therefore have reason to think carefully about our personal situation .
( a ) What purpose have organizational adjustments served ?
In 1932 the elective elders were replaced with a service committee elected by the congregation to assist an appointed service director .
Under the direction of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses , since 1972 , recommendations are made and if these are approved , the congregations receive letters theocratically appointing overseers and ministerial servants .
What is the spiritual condition of Jehovah’s people ?
Look ! My own servants will drink , but you yourselves will go thirsty . Look !
What will help us to prepare for survival ?
We will have the support of fellow believers as we strive to manifest “ the new personality ” and put forth wholehearted efforts to help others learn of Jehovah’s provision for salvation . ​ — Ephesians 4 : 22 - 24 ; Colossians 3 : 9 , 10 ; 1 Timothy 4 : 16 .
Satan and his evil world are keenly desirous of luring us away from the Christian congregation .
May love for Jehovah and gratitude for his loving provisions move us to be more determined than ever to thwart Satan’s efforts .
• How do our times parallel Noah’s day ?
• What quality is essential for survival ?

“ The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich , and he adds no pain with it . ” ​ — PROVERBS 10 : 22 .
This is true of children who are so preoccupied with the privileges of adulthood that they overlook the benefits of childhood until it is long gone .
All of this can be avoided by appreciatively meditating on our present blessings .
“ The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich , and he adds no pain with it , ” states Proverbs 10 : 22 .
Let us consider some aspects of our spiritual prosperity and see what they mean to us personally .

And we are assured that “ he adds no pain with it . ”
What Did You Learn ?
• Why is it unwise to be overly preoccupied with the future ?
Through the prophet Haggai , Jehovah foretold : “ I will rock all the nations , and the desirable things of all the nations must come in ; and I will fill this house with glory . ”
The answer is no .
Quoting from this verse , the apostle Paul wrote : “ He has promised , saying : ‘ Yet once more I will set in commotion not only the earth but also the heaven . ’
A note found in the husband’s pocket stated : “ We are ending our lives because of constant abuses and harassment from our son and daughter - in - law . ”
The details of this story may be unusual , but the underlying issue is disturbingly common .
Consider the following :
However , many seniors are too ashamed or too afraid to talk about their plight .
He adds : “ I see the problem magnifying over the next few years . ”
The number of reported cases of elder abuse in Canterbury rose dramatically from 65 in 2002 to 107 in 2003 .
God Cares for the Elderly
TODAY’S rampant mistreatment of the elderly is not surprising .
Jehovah God’s concern for the elderly is evident in the Hebrew Scriptures .
At Psalm 68 : 5 , for example , David calls God “ a judge of widows , ” who are often elderly .
Widows ​ — and all faithful elderly ones — ​ are highly valued by God and by his servants .
The disciple James provides further reason for us to care for the elderly .
It calls to our attention how important these dear ones are to Jehovah .
There is another point to be drawn from James ’ words .
There is no doubt that many among the elderly experience such distress .
Consider John , * a faithful proclaimer of God’s Kingdom for more than four decades , the last three of which he has spent in special full - time service .
I continually think to myself that I could have done better . ”
Such ones can be comforted in knowing that Jehovah , while perfect , is not a perfectionist .
Though he is aware of our mistakes , the Bible says of him : “ If errors were what you watch , O Jah , O Jehovah , who could stand ? ”
You have considered my thought from far off .
Under divine inspiration , David assures us that Jehovah knows how to sift out and preserve in his memory our good works .
As already noted , many of the bad conditions we are experiencing today ​ — including the mistreatment of the elderly — ​ constitute evidence that we are living in “ the last days ” of this system of things .
Among Jehovah’s Witnesses , congregation elders take the lead in showing regard for the elderly .
It may be that the elderly one needs assistance in determining if he or she is eligible for any provisions that the government makes available .

For us to keep peace , it may sometimes be wise to “ give back ” by apologizing , even if we are not convinced that we are in the wrong .
70 : 1 - 5 .
Young ones do well to lean on Jehovah in all that they do .
What wonderful blessings are described there ​ — abundant peace , the end of oppression and violence , plenty of grain on the earth !
Amen and Amen . ”
Do you know who is pictured by “ the king’s daughter ” ?
1 , 2 .
Thousands of exiles return home to restore the worship of Jehovah in Jerusalem . ​ — 2 Chronicles 36 : 22 , 23 ; Ezra 1 : 1 - 4 .
“ The first things ​ — here they have come , but new things I am telling out , ” Jehovah declares .
“ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has spoken ! Who will not prophesy ? ” ​ — Amos 3 : 7 , 8 .
In what way did Jehovah’s “ counsel ” prevail in connection with Babylon’s downfall ?
God’s “ counsel , ” that is , his will or purpose as far as Babylon was concerned , involved calling Cyrus out of Persia to conquer Babylon and bring about its downfall .
As already noted , it unfailingly came to pass in the year 539 B.C.E .
Isaiah expressed similar confidence when he stated : “ Jehovah of armies himself has counseled , and who can break it up ?
And his hand is the one stretched out , and who can turn it back ? ”
Later , when restored to his senses following a period of insanity , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon humbly acknowledged : “ There exists no one that can check [ God’s ] hand or that can say to him , ‘ What have you been doing ? ’ ”
The promise at Genesis 3 : 15 indicates that immediately after Adam and Eve sinned , Jehovah determined that his symbolic woman was to bring forth a seed , or son .
In the meantime , Jehovah’s purpose unfailingly advanced through the chosen genealogical line down to Jesus ’ appearing as the promised Messiah . ​ — Luke 3 : 15 , 23 - 38 ; Galatians 4 : 4 .
Did Jehovah predetermine from the beginning that Adam and Eve would sin ?
The apostle Peter refers to these as “ a holy nation . ”
How do we know that the 144,000 are not predestined as individuals ?
Consider how all of this relates to the events in the garden of Eden .
As a loving Father , Jehovah provided everything human creatures needed .
Unlike the animal creation , which is largely guided by instinct , Adam had the ability to make choices .
The result of this was that God looked down from his heavenly throne and saw “ everything he had made and , look ! it was very good . ” ​ — Genesis 1 : 26 - 31 ; 2 Peter 2 : 12 .
When Jehovah chose to lay a command upon Adam not to eat of “ the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , ” He provided adequate instruction so that Adam could decide what to do .
Jehovah apparently chose not to foresee what Adam ​ — and Eve — ​ would do , even though He has the ability to know everything in advance .
The apostle Paul clearly reasoned that “ through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ” ​ — Deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 ; Romans 5 : 12 ; Jeremiah 10 : 23 .
See the brochure A Book for All People , page 28 , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
• In what way does Jehovah exercise his foreknowledge ?
Jehoshaphat had confidence in Jehovah
[ Picture on page 23 ]
God foretold Jesus ’ death and resurrection
Observing the makeup of his earthly son , Jehovah made this assessment of his handiwork : “ Look ! it [ is ] very good . ” ​ — Genesis 1 : 31 ; Psalm 95 : 6 .
Although Jehovah has the ability to know in advance what will happen , he does not predetermine our individual actions and destiny .
What was the first of the Ten Commandments , and how did faithful Israelites choose to obey it ?
5 , 6 .
Then , referring to his family , he continued : “ As for me and my household , we shall serve Jehovah . ” ​ — Joshua 24 : 15 .
In Isaiah’s day , what choice did some Israelites make , and with what consequences ?
The prophet Isaiah recorded God’s view of this unfaithfulness : “ You men are those leaving Jehovah , those forgetting my holy mountain , those setting in order a table for the god of Good Luck and those filling up mixed wine for the god of Destiny . ”
“ The flood came and swept them all away . ”
Centuries after Israel’s deliverance from Pharaoh’s control , the prophet Isaiah declared : “ O Jehovah , you are our Father . We are the clay , and you are our Potter ; and all of us are the work of your hand . ”
“ You Must Make Them Known ”
According to Deuteronomy 4 : 9 , Moses reminded Israel of what twofold responsibility ?
16 , 17 . ( a ) What have Gilead - trained missionaries been able to accomplish in the Kingdom - preaching work ?
One fine example is Mary Olson , who graduated from Gilead in 1944 .
Although somewhat restricted by physical problems brought on by old age , Sister Olson maintains her enthusiasm for preaching .
* “ It provides an orderly spiritual routine that has given structure and stability to my life . ”
When Sister Porter and other faithful servants look back , they do not forget what Jehovah has done .
What about us ?
Moses reminded the Israelites that they were not to forget all the things Jehovah had done for them and that these things should not depart from their heart all the days of their life .
He then added a further step : “ You must make them known to your sons and to your grandsons . ”
Single sisters can learn lessons from the faithful example of older sisters whose life stories are related in The Watchtower .
How , then , can each of us “ choose life ” ?
• What twofold responsibility are we urged to fulfill ?

In the face of this trial , the psalmist sang : “ How I do love your law !
All day long it is my concern . ” ​ — Psalm 119 : 97 .
Obeying the law gave him peace and a good conscience . ​ — Psalm 119 : 1 , 9 , 65 , 93 , 98 , 165 .
In such an environment , it can be difficult to maintain our love for Jehovah and for what is right .
What helped the psalmist to withstand the pressures he experienced was his dedicating time to pore over God’s law with appreciation .
“ The sabbath came into existence for the sake of man , ” said Jesus .
It not only allowed the Israelites to rest but also gave them the opportunity to draw close to and show love for their Creator .
It was a day dedicated exclusively to spiritual interests .
What lesson does the Sabbath arrangement provide for Christians ?
God’s people are no longer required to observe a literal 24 - hour sabbath rest , but the Sabbath arrangement remains much more than a historical curiosity .
Sacred interests must not be overshadowed by material preoccupations or recreational pursuits .
Or are other interests crowding out such activities ? ”
It is really overwhelming to see how much Jehovah loves his servants , how he cares for me personally , and how he has acted in my behalf . ”
What great joy we too can have from regularly attending to our spiritual needs !
How did the gleaning arrangement work ?
Sheaves of grain inadvertently left in the fields should not be retrieved .
This was a loving arrangement in behalf of the poor , the alien residents , the orphans , and the widows .
The more generous we are , the greater our blessings will be .
While caring for one another is a Christian obligation , doing so also helps the caregiver .
It also safeguarded them from the temptation to commit theft or immorality .
The Bible calls covetousness a manifestation of “ a disapproved mental state . ”
This is exactly the kind of spirit that Jehovah’s Law condemned .
The apostle Paul warned : “ Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires , which plunge men into destruction and ruin .
The principles behind the Law that Jehovah gave to the ancient nation of Israel are as valuable in our difficult times as they were when Jehovah gave that Law to Moses .
The more we apply these principles in our lives , the more we will appreciate them , the more we will come to love them , and the happier we will be .
• How does the commandment against covetousness protect us ?
How does Jehovah give us reminders , and why do we need them ?
Much of what we read or hear on these occasions is not new to us .
They renew our spirit by helping us to keep in focus the reasons that motivated us to adopt a godly life course .
( b ) Which episodes from the Scriptures will be considered in this article ?
Though penned many centuries ago , God’s Word is dynamic .
It presents us with true accounts of the lives of Bible characters .
While customs and points of view have changed much since Bible times , the challenges we have to face are often similar to those faced back then .
It is unthinkable , on my part , from Jehovah’s standpoint , to thrust my hand out against the anointed of Jehovah ! ” ​ — 1 Samuel 24 : 3 - 15 ; 26 : 7 - 20 .
Why is the story of David and Saul of interest to us ?
It could be that an individual is acting in a way that is not appropriate .
Or you might be facing problems of social injustice or religious prejudice .
We too should remain faithful to Jehovah and to his organization regardless of injustices we suffer and regardless of what others do .
There seemed little that these true Christians could do to defend themselves .
9 , 10 . ( a ) How can we benefit from certain Scriptural examples ?
Indeed , the Bible contains many accounts of people , even among God’s servants , who did wrong and suffered the consequences .
They wanted to make a good impression and appear to be doing more than they actually were .
The apostle Peter , under the inspiration of holy spirit , unmasked their dishonesty and hypocrisy , and Jehovah struck them dead . ​ — Acts 5 : 1 - 10 .
If we are ever tempted to distort the truth in an attempt to make people think well of us , may the story of Ananias and Sapphira stand as a sober reminder .
The most important benefit , though , is that honesty wins us the friendship of Almighty God . ​ — Psalm 15 : 1 , 2 .
( b ) Why was one Christian woman grateful that she heeded God’s reminders ?
Hence , Joseph’s story is a timely reminder for us .
At work , a handsome colleague made overtures to her .
When she felt herself weakening in her resolve to resist , she supplicated Jehovah to help her remain faithful to Him .
We can all increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s standards by striving to understand why he had certain accounts preserved in the Scriptures for us .
If we do so , we will be able to sing with the psalmist : “ Happy are those observing [ Jehovah’s ] reminders ; with all the heart they keep searching for him .
• What can we learn from David’s attitude toward Saul ?
[ Picture on page 28 ]
AN INCIDENT in the life of King David highlights the difference between true humility and wicked pride .
Why did Michal feel this way ?
Interestingly , the expression David used when he said to Michal , “ I will become low ” is from a Hebrew root verb that is also used to describe God’s own view of mankind .
That is why thinking people search for enlightenment .
Gautama ultimately chose a process of intense personal meditation as the way to true enlightenment .
Others have used mind - altering drugs in their search for enlightenment .
How ?
Through the Power of Reason ?
Its followers returned to the ideas of the ancient Greeks ​ — namely , that human reason and scientific investigation are the keys to true enlightenment .
Another member of the rationalist movement , Bernard de Fontenelle , felt that human reason on its own would lead mankind to “ a century which will become more enlightened day by day , so that all previous centuries will be lost in darkness by comparison . ” ​ — Encyclopædia Britannica .
IT WAS December 18 , 1810 .
What can you do to protect yourself ?
Make sure that your source of enlightenment is genuine and trustworthy .
There was nothing evil in God’s human creation .
Evil came about only when some of God’s creations ​ — both human and spirit — ​ misused their freedom of choice and rebelled against God .
Rather , he said : “ The Father is greater than I am . ” ​ — John 14 : 28 .
Jesus Christ gave his life as a ransom sacrifice to redeem mankind from the sin that our original parents , Adam and Eve , introduced into the human family .
God has set up a heavenly Kingdom , or government , made up of Jesus Christ and those chosen from among mankind .
God has entrusted this government with the task of making sure that his will is done on earth as in heaven .
Their home was to be the earth .
He arranged to choose people “ out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation . . . to rule as kings ” with Christ in a heavenly government .
That Kingdom government will soon “ crush and put an end ” to all forms of human rulership , which have brought so much misery and pain to the human family . ​ — Daniel 2 : 44 .
The very first book of the Bible tells us : “ Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life , and the man came to be a living soul . ”
The soul is not immortal .
When the time that God has temporarily permitted wickedness is over , “ all those in the memorial tombs will hear [ Jesus ’ ] voice and come out , those who did good things to a resurrection of life , those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment . ”
If you received a message that could have a profound effect on your life , would you accept it at face value simply because it appeared to come from a good source ?
You can do the same .
Is Jesus Almighty God ?
That year , he humiliated a world power and delivered the Israelites from slavery .
In so doing , he became their Savior and Owner .
He provided his people with laws that governed their social order and , more important , their worship .
Isaiah said : “ This is what Jehovah has said , your Creator , O Jacob , and your Former , O Israel : ‘ Do not be afraid , for I have repurchased you . I have called you by your name .
You are my witnesses , ’ is the utterance of Jehovah , ‘ even my servant whom I have chosen , . . . the people whom I have formed for myself , that they should recount the praise of me . ’ ” ​ — Isaiah 43 : 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 21 .
In short , they were to be a nation of witnesses for Jehovah .
For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God . ”
Free to Choose
Hence , the Israelites individually had to choose to love Jehovah , to listen to his voice , and to stick to him .
Living Up to Their Dedication
Jehovah provided his people with opportunities to live up to the national dedication .
While all Israelites were dedicated to Jehovah by reason of birth , those who made their dedication meaningful by making voluntary offerings ‘ gained approval for themselves ’ and were richly blessed . ​ — Malachi 3 : 10 .
Jehovah has said . ” ​ — Malachi 1 : 10 , 13 ; Amos 5 : 22 .
But the great majority of the Israelite nation proved false to their dedication .
They rejected the Messiah and eventually killed him . ​ — Acts 7 : 51 - 53 .
A few days before his death , Jesus told the Jewish religious leaders : “ Did you never read in the Scriptures , ‘ The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone .
What prophetic statement did Jehovah make in the days of Jeremiah ?
When and on what basis did Jehovah’s new dedicated nation come into being ?
Identify that new nation .
For you were once not a people , but are now God’s people . ” The special relationship between Jehovah and fleshly Israel had ended .
In 33 C.E . , Jehovah’s favor had been transferred from earthly Israel to spiritual Israel , the Christian congregation , ‘ a nation producing the fruits ’ of the Messianic Kingdom . ​ — Matthew 21 : 43 .
Such Jews and proselytes had to signify by their baptism not only that they had dedicated their lives to Jehovah but also that they had accepted Jesus as the means whereby Jehovah would forgive their sins .
In Paul’s day , how did rightly disposed ones ​ — Jews and Gentiles — ​ become part of spiritual Israel ?
After convincing people ​ — Jews and Gentiles — ​ that Jesus was Christ , the Messiah , Paul helped them to dedication and baptism .
What sealing work is nearing its end , and what other work is going on apace ?
When it is completed , the “ four angels ” holding back the winds of destruction of “ the great tribulation ” will be authorized to release them .

Young Israelites were born as members of God’s chosen nation
Many mainstream churches of Christendom still baptize newborn babies .
3 , 4 .
What if a young person resists parental training because of peer pressure , the desire to go along with the crowd ?
Who can be said to exert harmful pressure ​ — the parents or the young person’s peers ?
Instead , he dignified them with free will .
The finest example of loving submission to God’s will is his only - begotten Son , of whom Jehovah stated : “ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . ”
What is the basis for serving Jehovah acceptably ?
Jehovah’s entire organization , both the heavenly and the earthly parts , functions on the basis of loving submission to God’s will .
Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve . ”
Similarly , it must be of your own accord that you choose to dedicate yourselves to Jehovah and devote your lives to doing his will .
The disciple James wrote : “ If one knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it , it is a sin for him . ”
Are you old enough to understand what you have learned and to begin to have a personal relationship with him ? Would it not then be reasonable to think that God considers you capable of deciding to serve him ?
Are you an unbaptized young person who is being raised by godly parents , attending Christian meetings , and even sharing in the preaching of the Kingdom good news ?
Likewise , the jailer in Philippi listened to Paul and Silas as they “ spoke the word of Jehovah to him , ” and “ he and his were baptized without delay . ”
Neither should you hesitate to get baptized if you qualify .
Numerous Witnesses around the world feel that their decision to get baptized when they were young helped them greatly .
Today , he serves happily at a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
In what areas is it necessary to go on perceiving what “ the will of Jehovah ” is ?
Dedication and baptism mark the beginning of a life wherein we take Jehovah’s will into account in every sphere of activity .
Fulfilling our dedication involves ‘ buying out time . ’
• Why should baptism not be unduly postponed ?

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Books Three and Four of Psalms , consisting of Psalm 73 to 106 , give us plenty of reasons for praising the Creator and blessing his name .
“ THE DRAWING NEAR TO GOD IS GOOD FOR ME ”
Psalm 78 reviews Israel’s past from the time of Moses to that of David .
The 79th Psalm laments the destruction of the temple .
Psalms 82 and 83 are prayers for the execution of divine judgment upon corrupt judges and God’s enemies respectively .
“ My soul has yearned and also pined away for the courtyards of Jehovah , ” states a melody of the sons of Korah .
In Psalm 86 , David asks God to guard him and instruct him .
Since the wicked have no regard for anyone in heaven or on earth , they do not hesitate to blaspheme God with their mouth .
76 : 10 ​ — How can “ the very rage of man ” laud Jehovah ?
Any hardship we may experience can discipline us in some way .
Jehovah may also have used angels to provide the manna for the Israelites .
83 : 2 ​ — What does the ‘ raising of one’s head ’ denote ?
The gesture signifies readiness to exercise power or to take action , usually to oppose , fight , or oppress .
73 : 2 - 5 , 18 - 20 , 25 , 28 .
This is the case even though adopting such traits may seem advantageous .
We ought to meditate peacefully about our concerns and resolve them in association with fellow believers . ​ — Proverbs 18 : 1 .
Becoming ‘ sour at heart ’ because of the seeming well - being of the wicked is likened to reacting like unreasoning animals .
Showing heartfelt concern for spiritual truths and carefully searching for them requires time for study and meditation .
81 : 13 , 16 .
82 : 2 , 5 .
86 : 5 .
The next few psalms speak of God’s beautiful qualities , superior thoughts , and wonderful works .
How should a ruler who fears Jehovah administer his affairs ?
The final two songs of Book Four laud Jehovah for his wonderful works . ​ — Psalm 105 : 2 , 5 ; 106 : 7 , 22 .
We make Jehovah our dwelling by looking to him as our refuge and stronghold , by lauding him as the Sovereign Ruler of the universe , and by preaching the good news of the Kingdom .
This requires that we set spiritual priorities and use our time wisely . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 15 , 16 ; Philippians 1 : 10 .
It is proper to pray that Jehovah “ firmly establish . . . the work of our hands ” and bless our efforts in the ministry .
Whatever the cause of our “ disquieting thoughts ” may be , reading and meditating on the “ consolations ” found in the Bible will comfort us .
The Bible urges us : “ Guard yourselves from idols . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 21 .
[ Picture on page 13 ]
1 , 2 .
Nevertheless , Paul reminded them to “ keep doing all things free from murmurings . ”
Why did the apostle give this admonition ?
Paul knew what murmuring can lead to .
A few years earlier , he had reminded the congregation in Corinth that it can be dangerous to murmur .
We are zealous for fine works , and we have love among ourselves .
In view of the injury that murmuring caused among God’s people in the past , however , we have good reason to take to heart the counsel : “ Keep doing all things free from murmurings . ”
Then we will discuss some things we can do to prevent murmuring from causing injury today .
An Evil Assembly Murmurs Against Jehovah
On occasion , the Israelites were discontented with their lot in life and expressed this by murmuring .
The Israelites complained about food , saying : “ If only we had died by Jehovah’s hand in the land of Egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat , while we were eating bread to satisfaction , because you have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine . ” ​ — Exodus 16 : 1 - 3 .
Actually , Jehovah sustained the Israelites with what they needed in the wilderness , lovingly providing them with food and water .
There was never a threat that the people of Israel would die of famine in the wilderness .
Your murmurings are not against us , but against Jehovah . ” ​ — Exodus 16 : 4 - 8 .
No wonder he said : “ How long will this evil assembly have this murmuring that they are carrying on against me ? ” ​ — Numbers 14 : 27 ; 21 : 5 .
Cite examples of murmuring recorded in the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Even some of Jesus ’ followers took offense at what he said and began to murmur . ​ — John 6 : 41 , 60 , 61 .
10 , 11 .
Why did the Greek - speaking Jews murmur , and how can Christian elders benefit from the way that the complaint was handled ?
The outcome was more positive in a case of murmuring that occurred shortly after Pentecost 33 C.E .
Many newly converted disciples from outside Israel were then enjoying the hospitality of fellow believers in Judaea , but problems arose in connection with sharing what was available .
They directed their complaint to the apostles , who arranged for prompt action to be taken because the complaint was justified .
Beware of the Corrosive Influence of Murmuring
12 , 13 . ( a ) Illustrate the effects of murmuring . ( b ) What might prompt an individual to murmur ?
An illustration might help .
Many types of metal have a natural tendency to rust .
The tendency of metal to rust can be reduced by coating it with rustproof paint and quickly treating isolated spots of corrosion .
Look at Things From Jehovah’s Point of View
This could be in order to help us develop fine qualities , such as patience , endurance , faith , and long - suffering . ​ — James 1 : 2 - 4 .
Our putting up with inconveniences without complaining not only helps us to improve our personality but may also impress those observing our conduct .
In 2003 a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses traveled by bus from Germany to attend a convention in Hungary .
Forgiveness Promotes Unity
The Hebrew term meaning “ to murmur ” can also mean “ to growl . ”
Very likely , we feel uncomfortable around a constant murmurer and try to distance ourselves from him .
If we were to murmur , or growl , those listening might feel the same way .
What will we discuss in the next article ?
Do You Recall ?
• How can willingness to forgive help us to refrain from murmuring ?
Forgiveness promotes Christian unity
This shepherd , musician , prophet , and king placed implicit trust in Jehovah God .
Such a house , or temple , would become the center of true worship in Israel .
Instead , that privilege was reserved for his son Solomon .
He wholeheartedly supported the project by passing on to Solomon the architectural plans that he had received from Jehovah .
Faithful Israelites supported the arrangements made for true worship at the house of God .
There certainly is no reason to murmur about it .
These publications include those designed for people with special needs , such as individuals with impaired vision or hearing .
( b ) What has been said about the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization ?
Men who meet the Biblical requirements are appointed as elders and ministerial servants in these congregations .
All of them make mistakes , and some have persistent weaknesses that they are working hard to control .
While David was still a young person , for instance , he was called upon to serve as musician to calm troubled King Saul .
For instance , David’s military commander Joab murdered Saul’s relative Abner .
Yet , David did not become a bitter complainer ; nor did he turn his back on true worship .
Adversity moved David to cling to Jehovah and maintain the fine attitude he had when he ran away because of Saul .
Neither Jehovah nor his angels nor the spiritual shepherds tolerate the presence of treacherous , wicked ones in the Christian congregation .
How did she react ?
According to the disciple Jude , false teachers of that day were “ disregarding lordship and speaking abusively of glorious ones . ”
Moreover , those wrongdoers were “ murmurers , complainers about their lot in life . ”
Moreover , “ owing to this many of [ them ] went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him . ”
The apostle Peter answered : “ Lord , whom shall we go away to ?
The Creator progressively reveals the truth to his people .
Hence , our understanding of the Scriptures is bound to be refined from time to time .
He contacted the Witnesses , admitted his mistake , and was reinstated as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
The ‘ faithful slave ’ may eventually publish something that answers our questions and clears up our doubts .
Prayer , personal study , and association with spiritually - minded fellow believers can also help to remove doubts and can deepen our appreciation for the faith - strengthening Bible truths we have learned through Jehovah’s channel of communication .
Instead of murmuring , what attitude should we have , and why ?
Instead of murmuring about things in the congregation , we do well to maintain a positive attitude and follow a routine that keeps us busy , joyful , reverent , balanced , and healthy in faith .
Jehovah is in control of everything within his organization , and Jesus is aware of developments in each congregation , just as he was in the first century .
A positive spirit will also enable us to bear in mind the many blessings we enjoy because of being associated with the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization .
This is the only organization in the world that is loyal to the Sovereign of the universe .
May your attitude be like that of David , who sang : “ O Hearer of prayer , even to you people of all flesh will come .
Do You Recall ?
Jehovah Delivers the Afflicted One
1 , 2 .
“ All I could do was cry , ” she says .
“ Still , I could not turn my condition around , ” she says .
To one degree or another , all of us experience the effects of that reality . ​ — Ephesians 6 : 12 .
Consider the upright man Job .
Job was not the only servant of God to experience intense anguish .
Why is it not surprising that there are “ depressed souls ” among Christians today ?
Our Sinful Nature Can Distress Us
It is not wrong for you to be keenly aware of your imperfections , for this can impress upon you the gravity of sin and can strengthen your resolve to shun badness .
To his words of distress just quoted , Paul added : “ Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! ”
Why should we reject self - condemning thoughts ?
Furthermore , he does not want you to feel hopelessly condemned .
The Devil will be destroyed because that is what he deserves , but he would like to have you feel that you deserve the same judgment .
Do not let Satan succeed in this scheme to destroy your faith .
At Revelation 12 : 10 , Satan is called “ the accuser of our brothers ” ​ — anointed Christians .
Do not let Satan destroy your relationship with God .
However , we will not benefit if we compare ourselves unfavorably with others and conclude that nothing we do is good enough .
Why can we exult in the service we render to Jehovah ?
For example , what if you are unemployed ?
Or perhaps you have become the victim of discrimination or some other form of injustice .
Even scanning newspaper headlines can make you feel as did the righteous man Lot , who was “ greatly distressed ” ( “ worn down , ” Young’s Literal Translation of the Holy Bible ) by the loose conduct of those around him . ​ — 2 Peter 2 : 7 .
The Bible foretold that many would have “ no natural affection . ”
How is Jehovah’s love superior to that of any human ?
As painful as rejection , mistreatment , or abandonment by a parent may be , it has no bearing on how much Jehovah cares for you .
What practical steps might a depressed one take ?
What does Jehovah promise those who are afflicted ?
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Humble yourselves . . . under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time ; while you throw all your anxiety upon him , because he cares for you . ”
As we serve Jehovah , he gives us strength to endure .
May we , therefore , maintain integrity to Jehovah so that we can enjoy everlasting life in his promised new world and see the day when he will indeed have delivered the afflicted one permanently !
• How does Jehovah help us to cope with our anxieties ?
It is closely related to faith and love .
Fear of God includes the deep conviction that our heavenly Father personally cares for us and is ready to forgive our transgressions .
From his early years , David was often out pasturing his father’s sheep .
Rightly , David was impressed when he compared his smallness with the vast starry heavens .
If he wins , we will serve you . ’
Saul and his entire army were terrified ​ — but not David .
With his sling and a single stone ​ — and with Jehovah’s help — ​ David struck down the giant . ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 45 - 47 .
God’s faithful servant Nehemiah urged his fellow Israelites , who were under pressure from opposers : “ Do not be afraid on their account . Jehovah the great and the fear - inspiring One keep in your mind . ”
Facing Problems With Godly Fear
Under what circumstances did David display fear of God ?
Although Jehovah had assured David that he would be king , for years David had to flee , to fight , and to wait for Jehovah’s time to make him king .
The king’s servants denounced David as an enemy of their nation .
This does not mean that we simply hand our problems over to Jehovah without doing what we can about them and expect him to act in our behalf .
Why do we need to take our prayers seriously , and what attitude should we never have ?
Proper fear of God should immediately have moved David to turn his eyes and his thoughts elsewhere .
Shortly afterward , Jehovah sent his prophet Nathan to expose David’s sin .
What a price to pay for a lapse in the fear of God ! ​ — 2 Samuel 12 : 10 - 14 ; 13 : 10 - 14 ; 15 : 14 .
Such tragic consequences can be avoided by truly fearing God . ​ — 1 Corinthians 6 : 18 .
How will you react when you unexpectedly encounter immoral images , words , or people ?
20 , 21 . ( a ) How can fear of God help us to avoid sinning ?
On the other hand , if we fear Jehovah , we will stay away ​ — even walk away — ​ from people , places , activities , and entertainment that could cause us to lower our moral guard .
Whatever embarrassment or sacrifice may be involved , it is minor compared to losing God’s favor .
It is also the source of true happiness .
[ Footnotes ]
Can You Explain ?
• How does fear of God counteract fear of man ?
Indeed , God’s Word assures us : “ Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah . ” ​ — Psalm 112 : 1 .
Regaining Lost Happiness
What helped David to recover from his sins ?
As considered in the preceding article , David on three notable occasions failed to show proper godly fear and sinned .
However , his response to Jehovah’s discipline showed that he was essentially a God - fearing person .
His reverence and respect for God moved him to admit his guilt , correct his course , and reestablish a good relationship with Jehovah .
David’s example can surely instill courage in Christians today who may fall into serious sin .
Coming to her senses , Sonja did everything necessary to repair her relationship with Jehovah .
Though Sonja regrets having temporarily strayed from the Christian path , she is happy that her fear of God helped her to come back .
5 , 6 .
It is much better , of course , when the fear of God helps one to avoid sinning in the first place .
Was not Jehovah giving David’s mortal enemy into his hand ?
Silently , David crept up to Saul and cut off the skirt of his garment .
David and his bold nephew Abishai slipped into the very middle of the camp and stood right over the sleeping Saul .
David restrained Abishai , asking : “ Who is it that has thrust his hand out against the anointed of Jehovah and has remained innocent ? ” ​ — 1 Samuel 26 : 9 , 12 .
What held David back from sinning ?
Out of proper fear of God , David was prepared to suffer , if necessary , rather than sin .
David knew that obeying and trusting in God would bring happiness and many blessings , while ignoring God would earn him God’s disfavor .
Fearing God Brings Happiness
In the end , this brings happiness .
“ I think about a certain mother and her teenage daughter who because of their Christian neutrality refused to buy political party cards , ” relates a longtime missionary in Africa .

Finally the baby came .
It strengthened him to act decisively and wisely under difficult circumstances .
How did fear of God help one Christian to make good decisions ?
But she wanted to become a concert pianist , and she made considerable advancement to that end .
Moreover , she felt self - conscious about preaching and was therefore afraid to accept the responsibilities that would come with baptism .
As a father , David was intent on passing on to his children a precious heritage ​ — the genuine , balanced , wholesome fear of Jehovah .
16 , 17 .
“ Our parents raised us in a way that made being in the truth enjoyable , ” says Ralph , who along with his brother serves at a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
They brought us up to believe that we could do good things in Jehovah’s service .
Most of the time , they sat us down and just talked to us , Mom sometimes with tears in her eyes , trying to reach our heart .
We learned through our parents ’ words and deeds that the fear of Jehovah is a beautiful thing and that to be one of his Witnesses is a joy and a pleasure , not a burden . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 3 .
What will we gain by fearing the true God ?
What will enable us to understand “ the fear of Jehovah ” ?
From Biblical examples and modern - day experiences , we see that the proper fear of God plays a positive role in the life of true servants of Jehovah .
Not only can such fear prevent us from doing what is displeasing to our heavenly Father but it can also give us the courage to face our adversaries and the strength to endure the trials and hardships that come our way .

• be a precious heritage for our children ?
During his prehuman existence , Jesus was God’s Word , or Spokesman .
What a beautiful description of the Son of God , whose fondness for mankind moved him to give his life as a ransom in their behalf ! ​ — John 3 : 16 .
Job ​ — A Man of Endurance and Integrity
1 , 2 . ( a ) What unexpected tragedies did Job experience ?
THERE was a man who seemed to have everything ​ — wealth , prestige , good health , and a happy family life .
Soon thereafter , he contracted a debilitating disease that left his whole body covered with painful boils .
Job led a blameless life because he worshipped God .
Why will it be helpful to consider Job’s ordeal ?
The issue was an important one .
Thus , Satan himself brought on the calamities that befell Job in rapid succession .
In what ways are God’s servants today subject to trials similar to those of Job ?
Actually , some problems could even be caused by our own mistakes or by an inherited physical condition .
The Bible makes clear that at the present time , Jehovah does not miraculously shield his servants from these afflictions . ​ — Ecclesiastes 9 : 11 .
Possibly , Satan deliberately sought to give Job the impression that it was God who had caused his affliction .
Job became profoundly discouraged , although he refused to curse God , as his wife urged him to do .
They assumed that Job had brought his suffering upon himself by committing some serious sin .
“ Who that is innocent has ever perished ? ”
“ According to what I have seen , those devising what is hurtful and those sowing trouble will themselves reap it . ” ​ — Job 4 : 7 , 8 .
Yet , in this present system , trouble can arise regardless of our conduct .
Tragedies , illness , or persecution may seem so unfair .
We must never allow the thoughtless comments of others to make us doubt our heavenly Father .
What divine provisions can help us to endure ?
“ For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me , ” he wrote . ​ — Philippians 4 : 13 .
So help is available , and you should never hesitate to seek it .
While journeying toward Rome as a prisoner , Paul “ thanked God and took courage ” when he met the brothers at the Marketplace of Appius and Three Taverns .
Despite feeling discouraged and not understanding why he suffered , Job never wavered on the vital issue of loyalty .
Job refused to deny everything for which he had lived .
In this system ruled by Satan , our endurance and integrity will be put to the test .
The important thing is to prove ourselves faithful .
Still , there may be moments in our lives when our trials seem unending and our suffering seems almost unbearable .
Doing research , talking with mature Christians , and pouring out our heart in prayer can help us to endure
“ You Have Heard of the Endurance of Job ”
She has been indeed !
Suffering evil is by no means easy , as many Witnesses can testify .
Grasping the Complete Picture
To maintain spiritual balance in the face of adversity , we need to comprehend the overall picture .
The book of Job clearly identifies Satan as the one who taunts Jehovah .
As illustrated in Job’s case , Satan essentially accuses all of Jehovah’s servants of selfish motives and seeks to prove that their love for God can cool off .
He has taunted God for thousands of years .
In addition , negative emotions can tend to damage one spiritually .
Having the “ mental disposition ” of Jesus can be a major defense against Satan’s attacks . ​ — 1 Peter 4 : 1 .
Such a misunderstanding hurt Job at a time when he was being assailed by the harsh words of his would - be comforters .
On the contrary , Jehovah promises to help us bear whatever burden falls upon us and to provide escape from any temptation that besets us .
Without doubt , the fundamental reason for his success was his faithfulness to Jehovah .
‘ He feared God and turned aside from bad . ’
That was his way of life .
Job listened respectfully to Elihu’s wise counsel , and he responded positively to Jehovah’s correction .
Finally , Job provides an outstanding example of mercy .
( b ) Explain why Elihu was successful in helping Job .
Unlike the three false comforters , Elihu did not consider himself superior to Job .
He encouraged Job to wait on Jehovah , rather than to strive to demonstrate his own righteousness .
Even if they claimed that they had had good intentions , they acted as tools of Satan rather than as faithful companions .
What should we bear in mind when under trial ?
Our loving God observes our situation and is both willing and able to help us in various ways .
It really happens that way .
Yet it really happened to me .
Jehovah helps . ”
Happy Is the Man Who Endures
Similarly , any pain , suffering , or heartache we may endure during the end of this system of things will be wiped away and forgotten in God’s new world .
The Bible promises : “ Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial , because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life , which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him . ” ​ — James 1 : 12 .
• How can we imitate Elihu in fortifying fellow believers ?

* Even in Latin America , a mere 15 to 20 percent of Catholics go to church regularly .
Like many others , perhaps you feel that religion is irrelevant to a better life .
In addition , as technology advanced , dramatic achievements in medicine , transportation , and communications gave people the impression that any problem can be solved by science .
The churches , for their part , failed to demonstrate clearly that living by God’s law is the best way of life . ​ — James 1 : 25 .
They naturally wondered : ‘ If the churches doubt the power of God to create and the wisdom of God to make laws , how does going to church benefit me ?
Why should I bother teaching religion to my children ? ’
They left the churches , and religion was no longer important to them .
Religion Used for Evil Ends
He said : “ Oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness , and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves . ”
Augustine used religion to control people .
Satan , a rebellious angel , is behind the misuse and corruption of religion .
He provoked religious men in the first century to try to corrupt Christian congregations .
The Bible also says : “ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
He was not interested in their rituals and prayers .
God is pleased when individuals express appreciation for all that they receive from him .
Reasonably , we should take an active interest in the true God , with whom life itself originated .
In the following article , we will see how true worship not only honors God but also benefits us .

Is true worship good for you today ?
Millions of people from all walks of life have found that worshipping God by doing as he asks is deeply satisfying . ​ — 1 John 5 : 3 .
But by contemplating the record of his dealings with people and by considering what he has created , you really can discern facets of his personality .
As we saw in the preceding article , however , the problem with most religions is not that they are organized but that they are not organized in the right way and for the right reasons .
Many organized religions serve unchristian ends .
But few if any of these things provide a solid basis for looking forward to a happy future .
On the other hand , the apostle Paul wrote : “ We have rested our hope on a living God . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 4 : 10 .
They invite you to discover for yourself what they have experienced .

( Psalm 107 : 1 – 119 : 176 )
“ O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving - kindness and for his wonderful works to the sons of men , ” sing the exiled Jews returning from Babylonian captivity .
Praising God , David sings : “ Your trueness [ is ] up to the skies . ”
In the following melody , he prays : “ Help me , O Jehovah my God ; save me according to your loving - kindness . ”
According to the Mishnah ​ — a third - century work that put into writing the earlier oral tradition — ​ these songs were sung at the Passover and the three annual festivals of the Jews .
110 : 1 , 2 ​ — What did “ [ David’s ] Lord , ” Jesus Christ , do while sitting at God’s right hand ?
110 : 4 ​ — To what has Jehovah ‘ sworn without feeling regret ’ ?
This involves more than a group of individuals worshipping God every day .
The number seven often denotes completeness .
107 : 27 - 31 .
109 : 30 , 31 ; 110 : 5 .
Jehovah is so high that he has to condescend even “ to look on heaven . ”
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah is humble and wants his worshippers to be that way too . ​ — James 4 : 6 .
114 : 3 - 7 .
This suggests the spiritual unity of the 12 tribes of Israel when they came together for worship .
131 : 1 - 3 ​ — How did David ‘ soothe and quiet his soul like a weanling upon his mother ’ ?
As a weaned child learns to find solace and satisfaction in his mother’s arms , David learned to soothe and calm his soul “ like a weanling upon his mother . ”
How ?
Rather than seeking prominence , David usually recognized his limitations and manifested humility .
120 : 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 .
Slanderous and cutting speech can cause unbearable distress to others .
133 : 1 - 3 .
Exiled worshippers of Jehovah felt attached to Zion , which had represented God’s organization .
Truly , grand prospects lie ahead of us .
Jehovah knows our activities , our thoughts , and our words even before we speak them .
He knows us from when the embryo was formed , before each body part became distinct .
Has knowledge of Jehovah become pleasurable to us ?
Jehovah’s thoughts “ are more than even the grains of sand . ”
139 : 23 , 24 .
How can we endure even severe hardships ?
Each of the first four collections of psalms ends with an expression of praise to Jehovah .
The final collection is no exception .
Jehovah’s thoughts “ are more than even the grains of sand ”
However , that grand privilege was taken away by sin .
Adam and Eve disobeyed God and lost their close relationship with him .
Requirements for Approaching God
How should sinful humans approach God , and what example illustrates this ?
What a fine attitude to imitate !
Later , when he was about to meet his brother , Jacob implored Jehovah for protection , saying : “ Deliver me , I pray you , from my brother’s hand , from Esau’s hand , because I am afraid of him . ”
After Jehovah delivered the nation of Israel from Egypt , he gave them the Law covenant .
Some Levites were assigned to act as priests on behalf of the people .
What was required for proper approach to Jehovah at the sanctuary ?
If the priests did not render such respectful homage , Jehovah would not be pleased with their ministry . ​ — Exodus 30 : 7 , 8 ; 2 Chronicles 13 : 11 .
In Solomon’s prayer of dedication at the temple , he entreated Jehovah , saying : “ Whatever prayer , whatever request for favor there may occur on the part of any man or of all your people Israel , . . . when he actually spreads out his palms toward this house , then may you yourself hear from the heavens . ”
Evidently , it had become the custom for people to gather in prayer outside the sanctuary while incense was being presented to Jehovah on the golden altar . ​ — Luke 1 : 8 - 10 .
Thus , when Jehovah was approached in the proper manner , he was glad to accept petitions from those who represented the nation as a whole and from individuals who sought to approach him personally .
Nevertheless , Jehovah still has an arrangement in place for us to approach him .
What is it ?
Thus , in the Christian arrangement , the sweet - smelling incense appropriately represents acceptable prayers and praise to Jehovah . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 3 : 10 .
What can be said about approach to Jehovah by ( a ) anointed Christians ? ( b ) the “ other sheep ” ?
Anointed Christians with the heavenly hope enjoy a unique spiritual condition foreshadowed by the inner courtyard and the Holy , which enables them to render prayers and praise to God .
What Prayers Are Accepted ?
God does not accept all prayers .
How , then , can we pray with the assurance that our prayers will be accepted ?
For their prayers to be heard , what requirement must Christians meet ?
There is an additional requirement .
( a ) When did the offering of incense in Israel become offensive to Jehovah ?
However , at times , the incense offerings of the Israelites were disgusting to Jehovah .
Likewise today , the prayers of those who profess to serve Jehovah but at the same time practice works that conflict with his laws become like an offensive odor to him .
[ Footnote ]
• In our prayers , how can we imitate the patriarchs ?
“ In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God . ” ​ — PHILIPPIANS 4 : 6 .
IF YOU were to request an audience with the ruler of your country , what kind of response would you get ?
However , someone may ask , ‘ What prayers are acceptable to God ? ’
Yes , as explained in the preceding article , a key factor in approaching God is faith .
Among such ones are Hannah , Elijah , Hezekiah , and Daniel .
We should follow their example .
This may be accompanied by praise .
Our heavenly Father is happy to accept our approach to him in any of these ways .
However , to receive this gift , the customers must come to the owner and claim it .
Hence , we are required to pray in Jesus ’ name , recognizing Jesus as the sole channel through which God’s blessings are extended to all mankind .
In the Bible , no particular position is specified for our prayers to be heard .
The Hebrew word ʼa·menʹ has the basic meaning of “ surely . ”
Or some circumstances may require that we become like Abraham , who repeatedly appealed to Jehovah in behalf of Lot and any other righteous people who might be in Sodom .
What May We Ask For ?
Remember that Paul said : “ In everything . . . let your petitions be made known to God . ”
Daniel set a fine example in this .
For example , like the psalmist , we may pray for deeper spiritual comprehension .
He prayed : “ Make me understand , that I may observe your law and that I may keep it with the whole heart . ”
Jesus “ offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death . ”
In so doing , he demonstrated the appropriateness of seeking strength when one faces danger or trials .
He later counseled : “ Keep on the watch and pray continually , that you may not enter into temptation . ”
We may be tempted to ignore Bible principles at work or at school .
We may be asked to do something that violates upright principles .
( a ) What personal matters are fitting subjects for prayer ?
( b ) Relate an example of such a prayer .
Out of the blue , the girl said : ‘ You should go to my school first thing Monday morning . ’
I asked , ‘ Why ? ’
She explained that there was a job vacancy that needed to be filled as soon as possible .
It all happened so quickly . ”
How can prayer help if someone has sinned ?
To illustrate : Airplane pilots know that if they get lost , they can communicate with air traffic controllers to get help .
What , though , if a lost pilot hesitates to contact the controllers because he is embarrassed that he got lost ?
Yes , an individual should personally confess his sin to Jehovah in prayer , but he can also ask the older men to pray in his behalf .
Answers to Prayers
For example , two Christian sisters in the Philippines were distributing Bible literature in a remote area of the country .
Jehovah is ready to listen and to respond .
Moreover , always remember the apostle Paul’s admonition : “ In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God . ”
In that way , you will continue to experience the truthfulness of what Paul states regarding those whose prayers are answered : “ The peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers . ” ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
Can You Answer ?
• How should we pray ?
KING SOLOMON of ancient Israel “ could speak three thousand proverbs . ”
The inspired sayings collected in the book of Proverbs have a twofold purpose ​ — “ for one to know wisdom and discipline . ”
“ True wisdom itself keeps crying aloud in the very street , ” says Solomon .
Solomon then says : “ Wisdom is the prime thing . Acquire wisdom ; and with all that you acquire , acquire understanding .
What will help us to resist the immoral ways of the world ?
Consider , too , the high price of committing immorality .
In chapter 8 , the value and appeal of wisdom is presented in a fascinating way .
The 9th chapter , a stimulating conclusion to the proverbs discussed up to that point , is presented as an exciting illustration that motivates us to pursue wisdom .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
1 : 7 ; 9 : 10 ​ — In what way is the fear of Jehovah “ the beginning of knowledge ” and “ the start of wisdom ” ?
Without the fear of Jehovah , there can be no knowledge , for he is the Creator of all things and the Author of the Scriptures .
Godly fear is also the start of wisdom because there can be no wisdom without knowledge .
More than serving as a literary device to explain the characteristics of wisdom , this personification figuratively refers to God’s firstborn Son , Jesus Christ , in his prehuman existence .
As “ a master worker , ” he actively worked with his Father during the creation of all things . ​ — Colossians 1 : 15 - 17 .
Since the Bible likens enjoying sexual intimacy within marriage to drinking refreshing water drawn out of a well , stolen waters represent secretive immoral sexual relations .
The idea of getting away with something gives such waters their apparent sweetness .
Lessons for Us :
4 : 18 .
If , upon closer scrutiny , the action we have taken seems unwise , without delay we should ‘ storm our fellowman ’ with persistent requests and do all we can to set matters straight .
We should develop an affection for wisdom and understanding .
Chapters 10 through 24 emphasize the value of the reverential fear of Jehovah .
These proverbs teach dependence on Jehovah and other vital lessons .
“ A good - for - nothing man ” may not only resort to “ crookedness of speech ” but also try to hide his motives with body language , such as “ winking his eye . ”
God’s dealings with humans spell security for the blameless but ruin for the wicked .
Covering knowledge does not mean that one does not display it at all .
The Hebrew expression translated “ thinking abilities ” can mean either discernment or malicious thinking .
13 : 4 .
13 : 24 ; 29 : 15 , 21 .
We may have to endure some difficulties by relying solely on Jehovah .
A lack of humility is disclosed when praise fosters a feeling of superiority .
Using a pastoral setting , these proverbs emphasize the value of finding contentment in a simple life resulting from diligent work .
The description of a good wife ends with the statement : “ Give her of the fruitage of her hands , and let her works praise her . ” ​ — Proverbs 31 : 31 .
What valuable lessons the inspired proverbs teach !
See The Watchtower of August 1 , 1991 , page 31 .
Concerning a good wife , the Bible says : “ The inheritance from fathers is a house and wealth , but a discreet wife is from Jehovah . ”
Indeed , words can have a powerful effect .
What effect do your words have on your marriage mate ?
If you asked your spouse this , how would he or she answer ?
Inherited sin exerts a negative influence on the way we think about and speak to one another .
Often , children who grow up in such an environment display similar traits when they become adults .
Of course , neither imperfection nor deficient upbringing provides an excuse for harmful speech .
It conveys the idea of ‘ shooting people with words . ’
What can result from using insulting speech , and why should marriage mates avoid doing so ?
They are bound to elicit a defensive response . That , in turn , may trigger a heated argument . ​ — James 3 : 5 .
Of course , the same can be said of a contentious husband .
Why is it important to control the tongue ?
“ The tongue , ” states James 3 : 8 , “ not one of mankind can get it tamed . ”
How might it be possible to prevent a disagreement from escalating into a heated argument ?
Consider a situation that arose in the life of Isaac and his wife , Rebekah , as recorded at Genesis 27 : 46 – 28 : 4 .
“ Rebekah kept saying to Isaac : ‘ I have come to abhor this life of mine because of the daughters of Heth . If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these from the daughters of the land , of what good is life to me ? ’ ”
Put Away ‘ Malicious Bitterness , Anger , and Wrath ’
Hence , to control your tongue , you may need to pray as did David : “ Create in me even a pure heart , O God , and put within me a new spirit , a steadfast one . ” ​ — Psalm 51 : 10 .
Momentarily step away from the situation until the danger passes .
What will help those accustomed to using harsh words to change their manner of speaking ?
When marital tension persists , there is no shortcut .
Proverbs 15 : 22 states : “ There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk , but in the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment . ”
If it seems impossible to do so , why not take advantage of the provision of elders in the Christian congregation ?
They have knowledge of the Scriptures and are experienced in applying Bible principles .
Bridling our tongue is a struggle .
Because of “ sin’s law that is in [ our ] members , ” we are inclined to misuse our tongue and other parts of the body .
However , the battle must be fought ​ — and it can be won with God’s help .
She “ should have deep respect for her husband . ”
Would a wife who respects her husband scream at him , using abusive speech ?
Although no imperfect human can perfectly imitate Jesus , striving to “ follow his steps closely ” will help husbands and wives to win the battle against misuse of the tongue . ​ — 1 Peter 2 : 21 .

What will help us to ‘ keep marriage honorable , and the marriage bed without defilement ’ ? ​ — Hebrews 13 : 4 .
Beware of a Treacherous Heart
What are some ways that a married Christian could unwittingly get involved in a romantic relationship outside of marriage ?
In some lands a large number of women have entered the workforce , and the gender mix has created fertile soil for improper office romances to develop .
5 , 6 .
Consider how a Christian whom we will call Mary got caught in a situation that brought her dangerously close to committing sexual immorality .
“ He was so nice , so different from my husband , ” she says .
And Proverbs 22 : 3 states : “ Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself . ”
The elders in congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses set a fine example in this regard .
When an elder needs to speak privately with a Christian sister , he does so in a public setting ​ — such as at the Kingdom Hall .
Think of the good times you have enjoyed together .
Successfully coping with day - to - day problems requires wisdom , the ability to apply Scriptural knowledge .
“ To my discernment incline your ears . ” ​ — Proverbs 5 : 1 .
For instance , it may be that a pattern of unkind speech has crept into their marriage and now characterizes it .
Yet , the fact that such a tragedy could happen is good reason to discuss problems openly .
Seeking solace in a romance outside of marriage is not the answer to marital problems .
Wrongdoing would adversely affect everyone involved and stumble others ! ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 6 : 3 .
What are some aftereffects of moral uncleanness ?
The Bible warns : “ As a honeycomb the lips of a strange woman keep dripping , and her palate is smoother than oil . But the aftereffect from her is as bitter as wormwood ; it is as sharp as a two - edged sword . ”
The aftereffects of moral uncleanness are painful and can be deadly .
Joseph was also “ beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance , ” a fact that did not escape the notice of Potiphar’s wife .
What caused Joseph to resist all her advances ?
“ Drink water out of your own cistern , ” says Proverbs 5 : 15 to married men , “ and tricklings out of the midst of your own well . ”
• What precautions can help one to keep from forming a romantic attachment outside the marriage ?
• What is the strongest incentive for maintaining marital fidelity ?
Sadly , the workplace can become fertile soil for an improper office romance
You Can Live Forever
The Scriptures show that the Creator planted the desire for everlasting life deep within the human consciousness right from the very start , from the time he created the first human couple .
To fulfill that desire to live forever , however , the first human pair had to accept God’s authority to decide what is right and what is wrong .
Had they done so , Jehovah would have judged them to be worthy of life “ to time indefinite ” in the home that he had prepared for them , the garden of Eden . ​ — Genesis 2 : 8 ; 3 : 22 .
Eating from the tree , on the other hand , would indicate their rejection of God’s authority .
Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah’s instructions and sided with Satan , a spirit creature who had rebelled against God’s authority .
The apostle Paul illustrated the condition of Adam’s offspring by likening it to that of a first - century slave .
That is why scientists will never find the key to endless life in man’s genetic code . The key lies elsewhere .
According to the Bible , the root cause of mankind’s death is moral and legal , not biological .
Jehovah God is “ from time indefinite to time indefinite . ”
Indeed , contrasting the resurrected Jesus with earthly rulers , Paul describes him as the only one among them having immortality .
Spirit - anointed Christians chosen to rule as kings in heavenly glory receive the same kind of resurrection that Jesus did .
For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption , and this which is mortal must put on immortality . ”
Death has no hold on those who receive such a resurrection . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 50 - 53 ; Revelation 20 : 6 .
Everlasting Life on a Paradise Earth
Righteous and true are your ways , King of eternity .
Who will not really fear you , Jehovah , and glorify your name , because you alone are loyal ? ” ​ — Revelation 15 : 3 , 4 .
If so , you must prove yourself loyal and obedient to the “ King of eternity . ”
You need to learn about Jehovah and the one through whom such life is made possible , Jesus Christ .

Some of their mixtures contained salts of arsenic , mercury , and sulfur .
Also widespread at one time were legends about a so - called Fountain of Youth ​ — a spring said to restore vigor to all who drank from it .
Just as I proved to be with Moses I shall prove to be with you . ” ​ — Joshua 1 : 2 , 5 .
A Faithless People Lacking Courage
Of course not !
Two of the spies , Joshua and Caleb , however , were eager to enter the Promised Land .
The Canaanites “ are bread to us , ” they said .
said Jehovah , expressing his deep hurt . ​ — Numbers 14 : 11 .
Jehovah went right to the heart of the problem ​ — the cowardly attitude of the people betrayed their lack of faith .
Jehovah’s servants today courageously preach the good news because they are of the same mind as the apostle Paul , who wrote : “ We are not the sort that shrink back to destruction , but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How did Jehovah strengthen the early Christians ’ faith ?
In order to build our faith and to press on in our ministry , we too must study and meditate on the Scriptures and pray for holy spirit .
Only by impressing God’s truth on our mind and heart ​ — as Joshua , Caleb , and the early Christian disciples did — ​ will we have faith that gives us the courage needed to endure in our spiritual warfare and to come off victorious . ​ — Romans 10 : 17 .
As demonstrated by integrity - keepers of old , faith that leads to courage and endurance embraces more than mere belief in God .
We can be certain that the faith of Joshua and Caleb deepened as they tasted God’s goodness .
How Jehovah rewards those who faithfully and courageously serve him ! ​ — Joshua 14 : 6 , 9 - 14 ; 19 : 49 , 50 ; 24 : 29 .
How does Jehovah ‘ magnify his saying ’ ?
When Jehovah attaches his name to a promise , the fulfillment of that promise is “ magnified ” in that it exceeds all expectations .
Immediately after mentioning Enoch’s transference , Paul again stressed the importance of faith , saying : “ Moreover , without faith it is impossible to please [ God ] well . ”
In this , Enoch set a fine example for us .
We have a similar work to do in a world that is opposed to true worship and that is filled with every form of badness . ​ — Psalm 92 : 7 ; Matthew 24 : 14 ; Revelation 12 : 17 .
Besides faith , there is another quality that contributes to courage , namely the reverential fear of God .
In fact , 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the sacred pole , were “ eating at the table of Jezebel , ” Ahab’s wife . ​ — 1 Kings 16 : 30 - 33 ; 18 : 19 .
That was the situation in which God - fearing Obadiah , * Ahab’s household steward , found himself . ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 3 .
What made Obadiah exceptional as a worshipper of Jehovah ?
In fact , 1 Kings 18 : 3 tells us : “ Obadiah himself had proved to be one greatly fearing Jehovah . ”
What did Obadiah do that demonstrated his courage ?
How did Obadiah’s godly fear help him , and how does his example help you ?
In the following article , we will see how love can help us to serve Jehovah courageously during these critical last days . ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 .
• What does true faith include ?
• How does godly fear contribute to courage ?
Enoch boldly spoke God’s word
1 , 2 . ( a ) What can love impel a person to do ?
“ He gave his own life for me , ” said the widow at the funeral service .
Godlike love , therefore , can develop in a person only when he draws close to Jehovah through accurate knowledge and acts on that knowledge in heartfelt obedience . ​ — Philippians 1 : 9 ; James 4 : 8 ; 1 John 5 : 3 .
5 , 6 .
In his final prayer with his 11 faithful apostles , Jesus showed the connection between knowing God and growing in love , saying : “ I have made your name known to them and will make it known , in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them . ”
When the early Christians received the promised holy spirit at Pentecost 33 C.E . , they not only recalled the many things Jesus had taught them but also grasped more fully the meaning of the Scriptures .
Courage and Love in Action
They preached in a number of cities , including Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra .
How did the courage shown by Paul and Barnabas reflect their deep love for people ?
Why ?
Clearly , their courage came from their deep love for Christ’s “ little sheep . ”
Recall what took place at a meeting that Paul held with the elders from Ephesus , where he had spent three years and experienced much opposition .
After encouraging them to shepherd the flock of God entrusted to them , Paul kneeled down with them and prayed .
Then , “ quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all , and they fell upon Paul’s neck and tenderly kissed him , because they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they were going to behold his face no more . ”
Likewise , many Witnesses have suffered at the hands of hostile rulers and their minions because of not betraying their fellow Witnesses nor revealing from where they obtained spiritual food .
Thousands of others have been persecuted , tortured , and even killed because they would not stop preaching the good news or cease associating with fellow believers at Christian meetings .
One of the Devil’s tactics is persecution .
How may our moral courage be put to the test ?
To resist and repudiate the evil spirit of the world , however , takes moral courage .
If it has ​ — even slightly — ​ then pray to Jehovah for the courage to root it out and keep it out .
Facing Personal Trials With Courage
How can Christlike love help us to cope with personal trials ?
“ I was self - conscious , ” she says , “ thinking that people would be appalled by my appearance .
Although Namangolwa owns a wheelchair , she often has to walk on her hands and knees when on a sandy dirt road .
One householder wept when Namangolwa witnessed to her .
As evidence of Jehovah’s rich blessing , five of Namangolwa’s Bible students have been baptized , and one serves as a congregation elder .
“ My legs often ache terribly , ” she says , “ but I do not let that stop me . ”
“ In the book study group I attend , ” says a congregation elder , “ one sister suffers from diabetes and kidney failure , one has cancer , two have severe arthritis , and one has both lupus and fibromyalgia .
Consider Mario , * who lives in the United States .
“ In time , I came to appreciate Jehovah’s qualities , especially his mercy , for which I often prayed .
In my body , I am reaping what I sowed , but now I at least have a wonderful hope .
I cannot thank Jehovah enough for his compassion and forgiveness . ” ​ — Psalm 103 : 9 - 13 ; 130 : 3 , 4 ; Galatians 6 : 7 , 8 .
Yes , along with love , faith , and godly fear , hope can be a powerful force for good in our life .
• How did love contribute to Jesus ’ outstanding courage ?
• By what means does Satan try to erode Christian love ?
[ Picture on page 24 ]

In fact , the words “ hope , ” “ hoped , ” and “ hoping ” appear over 160 times in the Bible and refer both to the eager and sure expectation of something good and to the object of that expectation .
What role does hope play in the life of servants of God ?
Do I pray often for God’s spirit ? ’ ​ — Luke 11 : 13 .
In that frame of mind , we may even experience “ shipwreck concerning [ our ] faith . ”
On the other hand , true hope strengthens our faith .
Why , Abraham and Sarah even had the courage to leave their home and their relatives and live the rest of their lives in tents in a foreign land !
Abraham kept his hope sure by obeying Jehovah implicitly , even when doing so was difficult .
That is why Paul also wrote : “ We desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end . ”
Other things may then capture our attention .
In fact , Jehovah expects us to do so !
Because when we do , we show that we know our heavenly Father well .
He is generous , and he loves his children .
If so , then like Moses and Paul , you will rest your hope , “ not on uncertain riches , but on God , who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment . ”
After all , why settle for anything less than “ the real life , ” which awaits those who hope in and love Jehovah ? ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 17 , 19 .
What assurance does Jehovah provide his loyal servants ?
People who rest their hope on the present system of things must think about tomorrow with a deep sense of foreboding as the world suffers ever increasing “ pangs of distress . ”
Because their hope is not in the present system , they joyfully heed Paul’s counsel : “ Let your manner of life be free of the love of money , while you are content with the present things . For he has said : ‘ I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you . ’ ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 5 .
Jesus also assured us of God’s loving concern , saying : “ Keep on , then , seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness , and all these other things [ the material necessities of life ] will be added to you .
Rather , it means showing “ soundness of mind ” as we keep Jehovah’s service in first place . ​ — 2 Timothy 1 : 7 .
If a person has doubts that Jehovah will fulfill His promise to care for His servants , then Satan simply needs to keep up the pressure and such a person might stop attending meetings altogether .
Yes , a lack of faith on our part can give Satan a hold on us so that he , not Jehovah , sets our priorities .
( b ) How do we keep Jehovah at our “ right hand ” ?
When a little boy walks hand in hand with his father , he feels safe and secure .
• In what way did Jesus ’ hope contribute to his courage ?

Weddings That Are Honorable in the Sight of God and Man
You may have attended and enjoyed weddings of Christians who want to serve Jehovah as happily married people .
Christians have found that the advice in God’s inspired Word is very helpful when a man and a woman plan to get married .
That is understandable because customs and even legal requirements vary according to location and era .
The Israelites recognized that step as constituting the marriage or wedding .
Many Bible versions render that verse something like this : “ There was a wedding in Cana . ”
In many countries today , Christians who want to marry must meet certain legal requirements .
Similarly , other Christians may choose not to hold a sizable wedding feast or reception that would require considerable planning and cost .
* They recognize that Jehovah originated marriage and provides in his Word wise advice on how marriage can succeed and bring happiness .
And most couples want Christian friends and relatives to share in the happy occasion .
Nevertheless , you can note certain common principles or aspects that are important to God’s servants .
This is appropriate .
When Caesar Augustus required a “ registration , ” Mary and Joseph complied , traveling to Bethlehem “ to get registered . ” ​ — Luke 2 : 1 - 5 .
Hence , Jehovah’s Witnesses do not repeat a marriage by having multiple legal ceremonies , nor do they renew marriage vows , such as on a couple’s 25th or 50th wedding anniversary .
In many lands , the government authorizes a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses to solemnize marriages .
( b ) How might the elders be involved in the wedding plans ?
In other countries , the law requires that a couple marry at a government office , such as city hall , or before a designated civil agent .
If a couple who will have a civil marriage desire to have a talk at a certain Kingdom Hall , they should beforehand seek the permission of the elders forming the Congregation Service Committee .
They will also review any preparations of the hall that the couple may request and decide whether there will be an announcement made about its use .
In certain places , how does a couple get married , and with what impact on the wedding talk ?
In certain places , the law may not require a couple to get married in any ceremony , even before a government agent .
The spiritually mature brother selected to give the talk will inform all attending that the couple are married by reason of the registration that just took place .
This does not refer to two individuals just living together , nor does it refer to a common - law situation that may have a degree of status in some locales but is not a full legal marriage .
The congregation would urge any who enter such a customary marriage to register it as soon as possible .
After a customary marriage , what is appropriate as to a wedding talk ?
As noted above , Christians entering such a legal marriage may desire to have a marriage talk , with wedding vows , at the Kingdom Hall .
There is one marriage , in this case the legally valid customary ( tribal ) marriage , and one Scriptural talk .
15 , 16 .
How should honor be involved in a marriage ?
Comparably , Christian husbands assign their mates honor and praise them .
The talk should be addressed to the couple .
Yes , the elder’s dignified wedding discourse will contribute to a marriage that brings honor to Jehovah God .
Paul urged us : “ Render to all their dues , to him who calls for the tax , the tax ; to him who calls for the tribute , the tribute ; . . . to him who calls for honor , such honor . ”
Yes , it is fitting that Christians , right from the wedding day , honor the arrangement that God has in place for the present .
An outline for a 30 - minute marriage discourse entitled “ Honorable Marriage in God’s Sight ” is used by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
For the groom : “ I [ name of groom ] take you [ name of bride ] to be my wedded wife , to love and to cherish in accordance with the divine law as set forth in the Holy Scriptures for Christian husbands , for as long as we both shall live together on earth according to God’s marital arrangement . ”
Do You Recall ?
Prove Your Faith by Your Life Course
Why did the early Christians give attention to both faith and works ?
But sadly , some were not .
Accordingly , Jesus encouraged those in Sardis ​ — and by extension all who would later read his words — ​ to prove their first love for Christian truth and to be awake spiritually .
Each of us can ask himself : ‘ How about my deeds ?
What is the Biblical position about sharing in gatherings ?
He had Solomon include in the Bible this reality : “ I myself commended rejoicing , because mankind have nothing better under the sun than to eat and drink and rejoice , and that it should accompany them in their hard work for the days of their life . ”
If you are arranging such a gathering and are responsible for it , you should think through what is planned , even if you are inviting just a few believers for a meal and friendly conversation .
If you decide to serve alcoholic beverages at a gathering , be moderate as to how much there will be , and make sure that there are appealing alternatives for those who prefer them .
Definitely refrain from making anyone feel pressured to drink something that might bite “ just like a serpent . ”
How can a host show that his is a living faith when it comes to conversation or other activities ?
At a social gathering , Christians may talk about various subjects , read some material aloud , or relate interesting experiences .
Weddings and Wedding Receptions
Why does planning weddings and related gatherings merit consideration ?
In one European magazine , a new wife said this about her “ royal ” wedding : ‘ We rode in a four - horse parade carriage followed by 12 horse - drawn cabs and a coach containing a band playing music .
They are not obligated to have a large wedding feast .
There was wine at the wedding Jesus attended in Cana , and he supplied wine of fine quality .
Interestingly , the director of that feast commented : “ Every other man puts out the fine wine first , and when people are intoxicated , the inferior . You have reserved the fine wine until now . ”
When the guests go home after a wedding feast ( or , reception ) , will they remember the music as reflecting that the couple were doing everything in the name of Jesus ?
If you choose to do so , what might you bear in mind ?
Thus , wise Christian newlyweds will refrain from publicly announcing the names of gift givers .
Proving our faith certainly involves more than living morally , attending Christian meetings , and sharing in the preaching work .
As we have considered in this article , however , there are other aspects of life in which we can manifest our faith by loving , considerate actions , including those associated with social gatherings and Christian weddings .
• when giving or receiving wedding gifts ?
Even when inviting just a few people , be guided by “ the wisdom from above ”
Reliable Advice for Raising Children
But it didn’t take me long to realize that I was lacking in practical knowledge . ”
Spend Time With Them
With many families needing two incomes to make ends meet , how can busy parents spend more time with their children ?
This sometimes happens as the children get older .
Ken believes , however , that the reason this approach worked is that communication in their home was not something new .
So why not follow the Bible’s advice ?
However , it is not just a matter of stimulating your children’s mental faculties .
You need to teach them how to discern right from wrong .
Both their children are now serving as full - time evangelizers .
When a parent’s patience wears thin , it is easy to get angry or demanding .
Jeff , mentioned earlier , makes this practical observation : “ As our children grew older , a good friend mentioned to us that he realized how often he had to say no to his children’s requests .
That frustrated them , leaving them feeling oppressed .
When Ruth , mentioned at the outset , became a parent , she and her husband sometimes felt all alone .
“ Never let them sit on your lap . ”
In a 1969 New York Times Magazine article , Dr . Bruno Bettelheim stressed that a child has the “ right to form his own inner opinions , influenced not by [ his parents ’ ] authoritative [ preaching ] , but only by his own direct experience with life . ”
Benjamin Spock said : “ Spanking teaches children that the larger , stronger person has the power to get his way , whether or not he is in the right . ”
“ MAN , born of woman , is short - lived and glutted with agitation , ” observed the patriarch Job .
How vital that we do not waste our short life on worthless concerns and endeavors !
Since Solomon refers to some of the building projects he had undertaken , he must have written Ecclesiastes after their completion and before his deflection from true worship .
1 : 4 - 10 ​ — What is there about the natural cycles that is “ wearisome ” ?
The congregator mentions only three of the basic operations that make life on earth possible ​ — the sun , the wind pattern , and the water cycle .
That can indeed be “ wearisome . ”
Laughter may help us to forget our troubles momentarily , and merrymaking can cause us to view our problems lightly .
However , laughter does not make our difficulties disappear .
3 : 11 ​ — What has God made “ pretty in its time ” ?
A king is no exception .
To receive the produce of his field , the king has to be served by the hard work of his servants who cultivate the land .
It is futile to spend time and energy trying to correct the oppression and injustice that we see today .
2 : 12 - 16 .
Wisdom has the advantage over folly in that it can help solve certain problems .
4 : 4 .
4 : 7 - 12 .
5 : 2 .
And “ better is the seeing by the eyes , ” or facing realities , than “ the walking about of the soul [ “ soulful desire , ” footnote ] , ” that is , striving to gratify desires that are impossible to satisfy .
The best way to live , then , is to be content with “ having sustenance and covering ” while enjoying wholesome things in life and focusing on maintaining a close relationship with Jehovah . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
Since the dead are conscious of nothing , how should we use our life now ?
7 : 19 ​ — How is wisdom stronger than “ ten men in power ” ?
Such tireless striving only makes him weary .
The light and the sun are for the enjoyment of the living .
11 : 10 ​ — Why are “ youth and the prime of life ” vanity ?
7 : 21 , 22 .
8 : 2 , 3 ; 10 : 4 .
This is better than to ‘ hurry and go out from before him , ’ that is , to resign hastily .
Hence , we should not idly waste time .
Wisdom is to be valued even when there is a general lack of appreciation for it .
10 : 1 .
Rather , cultivating the ability to ‘ use wisdom to succeed ’ is advantageous .
Moreover , we are assured : “ It will turn out well with those fearing the true God . ”
God’s gifts include food , drink , and seeing good for all our hard work
Do You Share Jehovah’s View of Sacred Things ?
“ Carefully watching . . . that there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things . ” ​ — HEBREWS 12 : 15 , 16 .
2 , 3 . ( a ) How do the Scriptures highlight Jehovah’s holiness ?
Jesus taught us to pray : “ Our Father in the heavens , let your name be sanctified [ or , “ be held sacred ; be treated as holy , ” footnote ] . ”
Jesus had a sacred mission to fulfill while on earth .
In addition , he was to die a sacrificial death .
Why can it be said that the Christian congregation of anointed ones is sacred , and what effect does this have on the “ other sheep ” ?
In fact , the entire group of anointed Christians on earth at any one time is likened to a holy temple , although they do not constitute Jehovah’s great spiritual temple .
The temple of God is holy , which temple you people are . ”
Our relationship with Jehovah is something sacred .
“ The prayers of the holy ones , ” or anointed Christians , are likened to incense used in temple worship .
What a privilege it is to be able to communicate with the Sovereign of the universe !
No wonder prayer is held sacred in our lives !
There is a force in the lives of anointed Christians and their companions that they by all means hold sacred ​ — holy spirit .
Jehovah gives his spirit to “ those obeying him as ruler , ” to those who “ keep walking by spirit , ” not according to fleshly desires .
What privilege do the anointed hold as sacred , and how is this privilege shared by the other sheep ?
In that way , the other sheep greatly assist the anointed ones in accomplishing their ministry on a worldwide scale . ​ — Isaiah 61 : 5 , 6 .
What activity did the apostle Paul hold sacred , and why do we have the same view ?
“ Perfecting Holiness in God’s Fear ”
What of the members of the “ great crowd , ” who will survive “ the great tribulation ” ?
• What things should we hold sacred in our lives ?
In ancient Israel , the priesthood , the tabernacle , and its furnishings were to be held sacred
Showing Respect for Our Sacred Gatherings
The tabernacle and its furnishings and utensils were to be anointed and sanctified ‘ that they might indeed become most holy . ’
The tabernacle was later replaced by the temple in Jerusalem .
At a public assembly in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah , the Levites “ were explaining the law to the people . ”
Nevertheless , we should not lose sight of the fact that meetings for the worship of Jehovah are sacred gatherings .
Jehovah’s Word is “ expounded , ” and as in Nehemiah’s time , there is “ a putting of meaning into it . ”
When the time comes to attend a meeting , we can be sure that it is there that ‘ Jehovah commands the blessing to be . ’
If Christ , by means of holy spirit , is present when Christians meet together in his name , should not such gatherings be considered sacred ?
That is also true of our Assembly Halls .
These occasions for worship , large and small , deserve our respect , and that should be reflected in our attitude and behavior .
Many of these are worded as prayers and should therefore be sung reverentially .
Quoting Psalm 22 , the apostle Paul wrote of Jesus : “ I will declare your name to my brothers ; in the middle of the congregation I will praise you with song . ”
Can we imagine any of those present letting their mind wander during that prayer ?
Our appearance with respect to both our clothing and our hairstyle can do much to add to the dignity of our meetings .
Proper dress and behavior at our gatherings honor Jehovah God , his worship , and our fellow worshippers .
Children , in particular , need to be taught how to behave at our meetings .
These can be either cold and sanctimonious or boisterous like rock concerts .
We want the meetings at our Kingdom Halls to be warm and inviting but not to the point of resembling a neighborhood social club .
Are you one of those who regularly ‘ come and bow down before Jehovah ’ ?
As the end draws near , we should be more determined than ever to attend our Christian gatherings for worship .
Out of respect for the sacred nature of our meetings , we do not allow secular work , school homework , or evening schooling to cause us to miss out on meeting regularly with our fellow believers .
We need the strength that comes through association .
We need to do this “ all the more so as [ we ] behold the day drawing near . ”
• What shows that the gatherings of Jehovah’s people should be held sacred ?
Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
It is challenging for a Bible reader to identify all the speakers in the Song of Solomon , but it is possible by considering what they say or what is said to them .
Second , the song illustrates the type of love that exists between Jesus Christ and the congregation of anointed Christians . ​ — 2 Corinthians 11 : 2 ; Ephesians 5 : 25 - 31 .
DO NOT TRY TO “ AROUSE LOVE IN ME ”
( Song of Solomon 1 : 1 – 3 : 5 )
“ They appointed me the keeper of the vineyards . ”
Her brothers are angry with her because the shepherd boy whom she loves has invited her to go for a walk with him on a lovely spring day .
1 : 2 , 3 ​ — Why is the remembrance of the shepherd boy’s expressions of endearment like wine and his name like oil ?
Just as wine makes the heart of a man rejoice and the pouring of oil on the head is soothing , the memory of the boy’s love and his name strengthened and comforted the maiden .
In effect , the Shulammite maiden is obligating the court ladies by everything that is graceful and beautiful to refrain from trying to awaken love in her .
Clean expressions of endearment may be appropriate during courtship .
Though beautiful , the Shulammite maiden modestly viewed herself as “ a mere saffron [ a common flower ] of the coastal plain . ”
And what can be said about him ?
He must also have been spiritually inclined and devoted to Jehovah .
Something “ is coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke . ”
And the king has brought the Shulammite maiden with him .
As he assures her of his love , she expresses her desire to leave the city , saying : “ Until the day breathes and the shadows have fled , I shall go my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense . ”
She invites the shepherd to “ come into his garden and eat its choicest fruits . ”
He answers : “ I have come into my garden , O my sister , my bride . ”
They ask : “ How is your dear one more than any other dear one ? ”
Solomon finally lets her go home .
4 : 11 ​ — What is significant about the Shulammite’s ‘ lips dripping with comb honey ’ and ‘ honey and milk being under her tongue ’ ?
5 : 14 , 15 ​ — Why are the shepherd’s hands and legs described in this way ?
Her moral strength thus enhanced her physical beauty .
( Song of Solomon 8 : 5 - 14 )
ask the Shulammite’s brothers when they see her return home .
The members of the bride class are unyielding in their devotion .
JEHOVAH loves the world of mankind so much that he gave his only - begotten Son in order that those exercising faith in him might have everlasting life .
How grand it is to experience such love !
and that I may not come to poverty and I actually steal and assail the name of my God . ”
Show Love for God’s Son
Paying attention to Jesus ’ words can help you to maintain moral integrity .
But Jesus revealed a principle behind that command by saying : “ Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart . ”
Let Jehovah’s Spirit Lead You
Why should you reject the very thought of practicing sin ?
We need to suppress sinful thoughts so that we do not cause our loved ones pain .
What lesson regarding wrongdoing can be learned from Proverbs 6 : 30 - 35 ?
He is “ bringing his own soul [ or , life ] to ruin . ”
Under the Mosaic Law , he would have been put to death .
What is the condition of a conscience marked “ as with a branding iron ” ?
Obviously , we must not accept the world’s low moral standards , and we need to exercise care in such matters as our choice of associates , reading material , and entertainment .
Paul warned : “ In later periods of time some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons , by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies , marked in their conscience as with a branding iron . ”
Through our faith in Jesus ’ shed blood , our conscience has been cleansed from dead works , “ that we may render sacred service to the living God . ”
How will fear of Jehovah affect your conduct ?
Be determined to “ render God sacred service with godly fear and awe . ”
It will help you to conduct yourself in harmony with Peter’s counsel to fellow anointed ones : “ If you are calling upon the Father who judges impartially according to each one’s work , conduct yourselves with fear during the time of your alien residence . ” ​ — 1 Peter 1 : 17 .
Why should you constantly put into practice the things you are learning from God’s Word ?
Flirtation and the entertaining of immoral ideas can result in fornication or adultery .
What comfort can be drawn from 2 Chronicles 6 : 29 , 30 and Proverbs 28 : 13 ?
But if you have sinned seriously , you can draw comfort from King Solomon’s prayer at the inauguration of Jehovah’s temple .
How Would You Answer ?
• What are some ways to avoid wrong conduct ?
[ Picture on page 21 ]
KING SOLOMON of ancient Israel gives each one of us a good reason to accept discipline from God .
Yes , your heavenly Father disciplines you because he loves you .

God’s servants study the Bible and Christian publications .
Jehovah’s standards are discussed at their meetings , assemblies , and conventions .
4 , 5 .
Consider a Scriptural example of disfellowshipping .
The congregation in Corinth tolerated “ such fornication as [ was ] not even among the nations , that a wife a certain man [ had ] of his father . ”
When disfellowshipped and thus handed over to Satan , the sinner was again part of the Devil’s world .
Before a very long time had passed , Paul urged the Christians in Corinth to reinstate the wrongdoer .
The sinner had evidently repented and cleaned up his life .
Disfellowshipping can accomplish what ?
Removing an unrepentant wrongdoer from the congregation upholds God’s standards and preserves the congregation’s spiritual cleanness .
Before he can be reinstated , his heart condition must undergo a great change .
What are these ?
Remember that your sin is not just against another human or the congregation .
Otherwise , you will have a guilty conscience , especially when you read or hear counsel regarding such serious matters .
What if Jehovah were to withdraw his spirit from you , as he did in the case of King Saul ?
Approaching the elders is one way for a person to “ produce fruit that befits repentance . ”
These faithful and warmhearted men will ‘ pray over him and grease him with oil in Jehovah’s name . ’
What a loving example was set by our Shepherd , Jehovah , when he freed the Jews from Babylonian captivity in 537 B.C.E . and when he liberated spiritual Israel from “ Babylon the Great ” in 1919 C.E . !
The elders search for sheep who wander away from the congregation .
The elders gladly comply with this counsel : “ Continue showing mercy . . . , doing so with fear . ”
Because they are primarily shepherds of God’s flock .
Christian shepherds are appointed by holy spirit and seek to be led by it .
With mildness yet firmness for divine standards , the elders try to readjust his thinking , just as a considerate doctor sets a broken limb carefully , to avoid causing needless pain and yet care for the problem .
An elder or two might handle the situation .
So take to heart any correction received when you study the Scriptures and Christian publications or when you hear counsel presented at meetings , assemblies , and conventions of Jehovah’s people .
What does true repentance involve ?
Hence , the antichrist’s activities must be understood in the light of how they affect Jesus ’ loyal followers on earth . ​ — Matthew 25 : 40 , 45 .
The “ false prophets , ” some of whom were once Christians , are also in that category .
These “ many antichrists , ” wrote John , “ went out from us , but they were not of our sort ; for if they had been of our sort , they would have remained with us . ” ​ — 1 John 2 : 18 , 19 .
What are some of their devices ?
Believing that knowledge ( gnoʹsis in Greek ) could be derived in a mystical way , Gnostics combined apostate Christianity with Greek philosophy and Oriental mysticism .
In his book The Church of the First Three Centuries , Dr . Alvan Lamson states that the doctrine of the Trinity “ had its origin in a source entirely foreign from that of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures ; that it grew up , and was ingrafted on Christianity , through the hands of the Platonizing Fathers . ”
They were apostate clerics who were infatuated with the teachings of pagan Greek philosopher Plato .
Furthermore , replacing the divine name with such titles as Lord and God is a violation of Jesus ’ model prayer , which says in part : “ Thy name be hallowed [ or , made holy ] . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 9 , The New English Bible .
Indeed , Satan , not Christ , is “ the ruler of the world ” and “ the god of this system of things . ”
Thy will be done in earth . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 10 , King James Version .
Because they support the political systems of the world , many religious leaders have opposed , even persecuted , those who proclaim the truth about God’s Kingdom .
The Bible goes on to say : “ Their end shall be according to their works . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 11 : 13 - 15 .
“ Do not believe every inspired expression , ” he warns , “ but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God , because many false prophets have gone forth into the world . ” ​ — 1 John 4 : 1 .
Yes , while eager to learn , the Beroeans made sure that what they heard and accepted was firmly rooted in the Scriptures .
This is the deceiver and the antichrist . ” ​ — 2 John 7 .
[ Box / ​ Pictures on page 5 ]
“ WHOM shall I send , and who will go for us ? ”
To this invitation from Jehovah God , Isaiah the son of Amoz replies : “ Here I am ! Send me . ”
Written by the prophet himself , the book of Isaiah covers a period of 46 years , from about 778 B.C.E . to sometime after 732 B.C.E .
While the book contains pronouncements against Judah , Israel , and surrounding nations , its basic theme is not judgment .
( Isaiah 1 : 1 – 12 : 6 )
Using Isaiah and his children “ as signs and as miracles , ” Jehovah assures Judah that the Syro - Israelite alliance will not succeed .
True justice is to become a reality under the rule of a figurative “ twig out of the stump of Jesse . ” ​ — Isaiah 11 : 1 .
Instead , the verse refers to establishing a forum of justice in which the righteous Judge , Jehovah , gives Israel an opportunity to change and cleanse herself .
The plural pronoun “ us ” indicates that there is another person with Jehovah .
This , of course , is his “ only - begotten Son . ” ​ — John 1 : 14 ; 3 : 16 .
Rather , he wanted to know how long the spiritually sick condition of the people would continue to bring dishonor to God’s name .
This diabolical scheme would have the effect of interrupting the operation of the Kingdom covenant with David .
This ongoing Assyrian transplantation of people to and from Samaria allows for the period of 65 years mentioned at Isaiah 7 : 8 .
( Romans 15 : 12 ) Jesus was “ out of the stump of Jesse ” in a fleshly way .
He was a descendant of Jesse through Jesse’s son David .
On the other hand , building appreciation for all that Jehovah has done for us will deter us from behaving without understanding and leaving him .
2 : 2 - 4 .
Our having a zealous share in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work helps individuals from many nations to learn the ways of peace and to pursue peace with one another .
4 : 4 .
To shed restraint and moderation in one’s choice of recreation is to refuse to act according to knowledge . ​ — Romans 13 : 13 .
Christian elders , or overseers , must avoid being “ wise in their own eyes . ”
Still , salvation is foretold for individuals who exercise faith in Jehovah .
There is also a promise : “ Look ! A king will reign for righteousness itself . ”
Judah will not remain desolate .
20 : 2 - 5 ​ — Did Isaiah really walk about completely naked for three years ?
24 : 13 - 16 ​ — How would the Jews become “ in among the peoples , like the beating off of the olive tree , like the gleaning when the grape gathering has come to an end ” ?
24 : 21 ​ — Who are “ the army of the height ” and “ the kings of the ground ” ?
“ The kings of the ground , ” then , are the earthly rulers , over whom the demons have powerful influence . ​ — 1 John 5 : 19 .
25 : 7 ​ — What is “ the envelopment that is enveloping over all the peoples , and the woven work that is interwoven upon all the nations ” ?
17 : 7 , 8 .
28 : 1 - 6 .
Jerusalem was to become “ like a booth in a vineyard ”
Love the God Who Loves You
THE question was evidently hotly disputed among the Pharisees of Jesus ’ day .
Of the more than 600 laws that made up the Mosaic Law , which was the most important ?
Was it a law that had to do with sacrifice ?
That too was important , since circumcision was a sign of the covenant that Jehovah had made with Abraham . ​ — Genesis 17 : 9 - 13 .
The answer Jesus gave has tremendous importance for us today .
Quoting from Deuteronomy 6 : 5 , Jesus said : “ ‘ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ’
Quoting from Leviticus 19 : 18 , he said : “ The second , like it , is this , ‘ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ’ ”
Forestalling any attempt to get him to list in order of importance the other laws , he concluded : “ On these two commandments the whole Law hangs , and the Prophets . ”
In this article , we will consider the greatest of these two commandments .
And how can we develop such love ?
( b ) What is worth more to God than sacrifices and offerings ?
The two small coins she placed in the treasury chest could not buy even a single sparrow .
And if I give all my belongings to feed others , and if I hand over my body , that I may boast , but do not have love , I am not profited at all . ”
Yet , real love is not just something we feel .
Love moved him to leave his heavenly home and to dwell on earth as a man .
“ This is what love means , ” writes Jesus ’ beloved apostle John , “ that we go on walking according to his commandments . ”
Those who truly love Jehovah long for his guidance .
Such love emanates from the heart , involving our feelings , desires , and inmost thoughts , and we fervently desire to please Jehovah .
We also love with our mind .
Why We Should Love Jehovah
Why does God require that we love him ?
One reason we should love Jehovah is that he requires us to reflect his qualities .
“ God is love , ” wrote the inspired apostle John .
Another reason for loving Jehovah is that we appreciate what he has done for us .
He was the One who brought them out of Egypt into the Promised Land , the One who protected , sustained , and cherished them , the One who disciplined them in love .
And today , Jehovah is our God , the one who gave his Son as a ransom that we might have everlasting life .
What is the first step in cultivating love for God ?
Yet , he invites us to enter into a loving relationship with him .
How can we do that ?
The first step toward loving anyone is to take in knowledge of that one ; it is hard to feel deep affection for someone we do not know .
That is why Jehovah , through his organization , encourages us to read the Bible regularly .
How does reflecting on Jesus ’ ministry enhance our love for God ?
A primary way that we can grow in our love for Jehovah is to reflect on the life and ministry of Jesus .
After all , Jesus mirrored his Father so perfectly that he could say : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father also . ”
Is it not appealing to know that he ​ — the Son of God and the greatest man who ever lived — ​ humbly washed the feet of his disciples ?
Does it not move you to know that though he was greater and wiser than any other man , he made himself approachable to all , including children ?
Another way that we can grow in our love for God is to meditate on the abundant loving provisions he has made to let us enjoy life ​ — the beauty of creation , the endless variety of delicious things to eat , the warm companionship of good friends , as well as countless other delights that give us pleasure and satisfaction .
Among the many gifts from God is the opportunity we have to approach him in prayer at any time , knowing that the “ Hearer of prayer ” listens to us .
The earth will be transformed into a paradise .
Do You Recall ?
• Why is it essential that we love Jehovah ?
• How can we show our love for God ?
“ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ” ​ — MATTHEW 22 : 39 .
It is to this commandment that we now give attention , and for good reason .
In his inspired description of “ the last days , ” the apostle Paul wrote that people would love , not one another , but themselves , money , and pleasures .
Notice , however , that Jesus did not say that the love of everyone would cool off .
How should we show love toward our neighbor ?
It is recorded at Leviticus 19 : 18 .
Verse 34 states : “ The alien resident who resides as an alien with you should become to you like a native of yours ; and you must love him as yourself , for you became alien residents in the land of Egypt . ”
Some taught that the terms “ friend ” and “ neighbor ” applied only to Jews .
Non - Jews were to be hated .
Jesus responded by relating a parable that described a Samaritan who came across a man , a Jew , who had been assaulted by robbers and stripped of his possessions .
It is helpful to consider further the context of the command recorded in Leviticus 19 that exhorts God’s people to love their neighbor as themselves .
For example , concerning the nations that the Israelites were to dispossess , Jehovah commanded : “ You must form no marriage alliance with them . Your daughter you must not give to his son , and his daughter you must not take for your son .
For he will turn your son from following me , and they will certainly serve other gods ; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you . ” ​ — Deuteronomy 7 : 3 , 4 .
Against what do we need to be on guard ?
Similarly , Christians guard against forming relationships with those who might weaken their faith .
We are admonished : “ Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers , ” those who are no part of the Christian congregation .
Christ died for sinners , and many who once practiced vile things changed their ways and became reconciled to God . ​ — Romans 5 : 8 ; 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 .
By our participation in this work , we show love for both God and neighbor , yes , including even our enemies !
Making this powerful point , the apostle John wrote : “ Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer . . .
Love moves us to be kind , compassionate , forgiving , long - suffering and not jealous , boastful , arrogant , or selfish .
It impels us to “ slave for one another . ”
How can we manifest love within the family ?
He will cherish her .
Our love for one another draws people to the God whom we love and represent .
The strong winds destroyed our reed house , and the zinc roofing sheets blew away .
What is the difference between loving a group and loving individuals ?
Though he came to earth to take away the sin of the world , he showed love for individuals ​ — a sickly woman , a leper , a child .
Similarly , we show love for our neighbor by the way we deal with the individuals with whom we come in contact day by day .
What does it mean to love our neighbor as ourselves ?
This proper love of self is not to be confused with the egocentric love of self mentioned by the apostle Paul at 2 Timothy 3 : 2 .
By loving fellow humans , we demonstrate that we also love the one who created man in His image , Jehovah God . ​ — Genesis 1 : 26 .
How Would You Answer ?
• How does the Bible describe the love we should have for our brothers ?
“ The great day of Jehovah is near . It is near , and there is a hurrying of it very much . ” ​ — ZEPHANIAH 1 : 14 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What special day do Christians await ?
( b ) What questions do we need to ask , and why ?
They all wait for a special day ​ — a day that will have an impact on their lives .
The day they await will eventually arrive , and when it does , they hope to be ready for it .
What is “ the great day of Jehovah ” ?
Throughout the Scriptures , the expression “ the day of Jehovah ” refers to special times when Jehovah executed judgment on his enemies and glorified his great name .
It will start with the destruction of “ Babylon the Great , ” the world empire of false religion , and culminate in the annihilation of the rest of the wicked system of things at the war of Armageddon . ​ — Revelation 16 : 14 , 16 ; 17 : 5 , 15 - 17 ; 19 : 11 - 21 .
How do you view the approach of that day ?
Does the fact that Jehovah’s day is on the horizon affect your day - to - day life right now ?
Perhaps we have heard these reminders repeatedly , but it is vital that we now , more than ever , continue to pay attention to these warnings . ​ — Isaiah 34 : 1 - 4 ; Luke 21 : 34 - 36 .
What attitude was displayed by people in the days of Noah and of Lot ?
It is no different today .
“ Keep in Expectation of It ”
What admonition should we keep in mind ?
Even if that day may appear to delay from our imperfect viewpoint , we must remember that Jehovah is not slow .
His day will come exactly on time , at an hour that humans do not expect . ​ — Mark 13 : 33 ; 2 Peter 3 : 9 , 10 .
In contrast , the faithful and discreet slave class loyally keeps its sense of urgency .
The Need for Urgency
That happened in the year 66 C.E .
Those years were filled with violence and bloodshed .
One historian describes the situation in Jerusalem during that time as “ a fearfully bloody civil war , accompanied by acts of horrid cruelty . ”
This resulted in great misery throughout the countryside .
With all these factors in mind , we can understand why Jesus emphasized the urgency of the situation .
Christians had to be willing to make sacrifices , not allowing themselves to become sidetracked by material possessions .
The same is true spiritually .
One way is by being involved “ in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion . ”
Keeping busy in such activities will help us to anticipate eagerly the arrival of “ the day of Jehovah . ”
Seek righteousness , seek meekness . Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger . ” ​ — Zephaniah 2 : 2 , 3 .
What will be the determination of God’s people during 2007 ?
So as we await that day , may we be ever alert to the times in which we live , realizing that the final fulfillment of these prophecies is near at hand !
• What is “ the great day of Jehovah ” ?
[ Picture on page 18 ]
When do we especially need the help of the holy spirit ?
Perhaps you did so after you learned that you had contracted a serious illness .
Or it may have been when your once - sunny disposition was overshadowed by the dark clouds of depression .
In addition , followers of Christ are attacked by Satan the Devil himself , who is waging a vicious war against those who “ observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus . ”
It is no wonder , therefore , that we need the support of God’s spirit now more than ever .
We find the answers to these questions in two of Jesus ’ illustrations .
3 , 4 .
Let us consider each of these two illustrations .
Jesus said : “ Who of you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , loan me three loaves , because a friend of mine has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to set before him ’ ? And that one from inside says in reply , ‘ Quit making me trouble . The door is already locked , and my young children are with me in bed ; I cannot rise up and give you anything . ’
In response , he will “ give holy spirit to those asking him . ”
Jesus shows us not only how we should pray ​ — with bold persistence — ​ but also why we should do so .
This , in his view , is an emergency !
9 , 10 . ( a ) Illustrate why we need to be persistent in asking God for his spirit . ( b ) What question should we ask ourselves , and why ?
Hence , with bold persistence we ask God for his holy spirit .
What Moves Us to Pray With Confidence ?
How the Holy Spirit Is Our Helper
( a ) What promise did Jesus make regarding the holy spirit ?
What is one significant way that we today experience such support ?
The holy spirit helps us to endure various trials .
Perhaps you face a similar situation today .
Note what the apostle Paul said next .
How did Jehovah answer Paul’s prayers ?
In response to Paul’s prayers , God told him : “ My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you ; for my power is being made perfect in weakness . ”
Hence , Paul experienced that through Christ , God’s powerful protection was spread over him like a tent .
Even so , for servants of God , these times are not impossible to deal with .
The depth of faith shown by such loyal servants of Jehovah is truly a source of encouragement for the entire congregation . ​ — Psalm 147 : 11 .
At times , though , we may observe the opposite .
It saddens us that former companions have left Jehovah , and it is our heartfelt desire to keep on helping each “ lost sheep ” to return to the flock .
A Warning for Those Living “ When the Son of Man Arrives ”
*
They lost their lives because they were so absorbed in those common activities that they did not pay attention to God’s will .
Today , people in general are likewise so caught up in daily affairs that they fail to see the evidence that the end of this ungodly world is near . ​ — Luke 17 : 30 .
( b ) What has caused some to lose their faith ?
And , indeed , this has happened to some Christians .
The Need “ Always to Pray ”
“ See That I Get Justice ”
( b ) Why can we be certain that Jehovah will hear our prayers and cause justice to be done ?
Jesus ’ illustration of the widow and the judge highlights still other important truths .
In applying the illustration , Jesus said : “ Hear what the judge , although unrighteous , said !
The judge had no interest whatsoever in the widow as a person , but Jehovah is interested in each individual .
But no one can rightfully question God’s faithfulness .
A valid question is , Will we personally remain faithful ?
Or did they have the sort of faith exemplified by the widow ?
Indeed , if a Christian were to stop praying for justice to be done , he would show that he had lost confidence that Jehovah is going to act in behalf of his servants .
The particular circumstances of that widow show us that we have additional reasons for persevering in prayer .
The widow kept approaching the judge even though no one gave her any encouragement to do so , but God’s Word gives us much encouragement to “ persevere in prayer . ”
By means of his prophet , Jehovah stated : “ Even if it should delay , keep in expectation of it ; for it will without fail come true . It will not be late . ”
Of course , this does not mean that a mere outward show of offering prayers is a remedy against loss of faith .
But whether we will personally receive justice and survive God’s war or not definitely does depend on the faith we have and the prayerful course we pursue .

How You Can Be Successful
JUST as parents care for their children and want them to succeed , so our heavenly Father cares for us and wants us to succeed .
In fact , when speaking about a person who pays attention to what God says , the Bible makes the bold statement : “ Everything he does will succeed . ” ​ — Psalm 1 : 3 .
If that is the case , though , why has a successful , happy , and fulfilling life eluded many ?
Their counsel , which ignores or disrespects God , is all around us .
As a result , even though many possess things that years ago could only be dreamed about , they still have an unquenchable thirst for more material things .
This thinking is a lie and “ does not originate with the Father , but originates with the world . ” ​ — 1 John 2 : 16 .
Remember that Satan selfishly deceived the first woman , Eve , to serve his own interests .
Understanding that such sacrifices are needed in order to obtain worldly success , sincere friends , family members , and workmates urged David : “ Do it for your family . ”
Although I was not with my family , my friends convinced me that I was actually giving more to my family . ”
“ I was on the phone with my daughter Angelica , who said : ‘ Daddy , why don’t you want to stay home with us ? ’
Of course , Bible reading in itself will not magically make you successful .
No matter how many times they have read it before , they treasure such precious moments .
By following Jehovah’s counsel and guidance , such a person becomes “ like a tree planted by streams of water , that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither , and everything he does will succeed . ” ​ — Psalm 1 : 3 .
It is carefully placed by a water source and cared for by the farmer .
True , it may appear that they prosper for a time , but ultimately they have a bad outcome .
Instead , “ the very way of wicked ones will perish . ” ​ — Psalm 1 : 4 - 6 .
Fruitless , materialistic pursuits can cause a person to “ wither . ”
Why is it that when a person follows God’s counsel , everything he does will succeed ?
The success of a godly person is linked to his doing God’s will ​ — and God’s will is always successful .
We have the mental and emotional capacity to love and be loved .
Best of all , by applying Bible principles , we can “ draw close to God ” and , like Abraham , even be called “ Jehovah’s friend . ” ​ — James 2 : 23 ; 4 : 8 .
[ Chart on page 6 ]
FIVE STEPS TO SUCCESS
Psalm 1 : 2 , 3
Second , Satan implied that humans would serve God only out of self - interest .
Nevertheless , Jehovah acted quickly to handle the situation .
For example , God told Abraham that the “ seed ” would appear among his descendants .
Who was the promised Seed , and how was his heel bruised ?
Jesus died on Nisan 14 , 33 C.E .
Like the blood of the Passover lamb , Jesus ’ shed blood provides salvation for many . ​ — John 3 : 16 , 36 .
( b ) How did the resurrection of Jesus make the fulfillment of Genesis 3 : 15 possible ?
His resurrection was foreshadowed during another festival .
On the next day , Nisan 16 , Israelites brought a sheaf of the firstfruits of the barley harvest , the earliest harvest in Israel , for the priest to wave before Jehovah .
The Law about this states : “ To the day after the seventh sabbath you should count , fifty days , and you must present a new grain offering to Jehovah .
What outstanding event took place at Pentecost 33 C.E . ?
When Jesus was on earth , the Festival of Weeks was known as Pentecost ( from a Greek word meaning “ fiftieth ” ) .
They became a new nation , “ the Israel of God . ”
9 , 10 .
The two loaves offered at Pentecost came from the firstfruits of the wheat harvest .
The apostle John said : “ These are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes .
First , the value of his blood is applied to the “ spiritual house ” of 144,000 anointed Christians , enabling these to be declared righteous and enjoy a clean standing before Jehovah .
That festival took place from the 15th to the 21st of Ethanim and concluded with a solemn assembly on the 22nd of the month .
They were thus reminded that at one time they had dwelled in booths in the wilderness .
The festival gave them ample opportunity to reflect on Jehovah’s fatherly care .
And since all , wealthy and poor alike , dwelled in booths that were similar , the Israelites were reminded that in relation to the festival , they were all equal . ​ — Nehemiah 8 : 14 - 16 .
It is noteworthy that during this ancient festival , 70 bulls were offered .
They too are now mere temporary residents in this old system of things , and they look forward with confidence to the time when “ the Lamb . . . will shepherd them , and will guide them to fountains of waters of life . ”
At that time , “ God will wipe out every tear from their eyes . ”
It is thrilling to consider that Jehovah provided foregleams of how his prophecy given back in Eden would be fulfilled , and it is exciting to see its actual fulfillment taking place step - by - step .
Further , most of the 144,000 have already proved their faithfulness to the death .
This motion symbolized the presenting of the sacrificial things to Jehovah . ​ — See Insight on the Scriptures , Volume 2 , page 528 , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
• In what way is the ingathering of Christians foreshadowed by the Festival of Booths ?

The two loaves offered at Pentecost foreshadowed the congregation of anointed Christians
“ The First Resurrection ” ​ — Now Under Way !
Yes .
Over the centuries , loyal servants of God have exercised faith in Jehovah’s promise about a Seed who would destroy Satan and undo the harm he did .
If they are to see the fulfillment of that promise and of others that Jehovah has made , they need to be raised from the dead .
Yes , it is .
This is the last of nine resurrections recorded in the Bible . ​ — Acts 20 : 7 - 12 .
They strengthen our confidence in Jesus ’ assurance : “ The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear [ Jesus ’ ] voice and come out . ”
4 , 5 .
What different resurrections does the Bible mention , and which will be discussed in this article ?
When does it occur ?
6 , 7 . ( a ) Before anointed Christians can go to heaven , what must occur ?
Yes , with what sort of body are they coming ? ”
That is not something they possess from birth , as if a so - called immortal soul were breathed into them .
When they are resurrected , they receive an assignment of work in the heavens .
For example , compare two chapters of Revelation .
Now look at chapter 17 of Revelation .
Reasonably , then , anointed ones who die before Armageddon are resurrected sometime between 1914 and Armageddon .
Why is that important ?
Can we be more precise ?
At this point , it may be helpful to consider what might be viewed as a Bible parallel .
Three and a half years later , in the spring of 33 C.E . , he was resurrected as a mighty spirit person .
Although this cannot be directly confirmed in the Bible , it is not out of harmony with other scriptures that indicate that the first resurrection got under way soon after Christ’s presence began .
Afterward we the living who are surviving will , together with them , be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and thus we shall always be with the Lord . ”
“ A White Robe Was Given to Each of Them ”
( a ) When are the visions recorded in Revelation chapter 6 fulfilled ?
But something else happens .
Since “ the soul [ or , life ] of the flesh is in the blood , ” what is really represented as being at the foot of the altar is the blood of faithful servants of Jesus who were slaughtered because of their bold and zealous witnessing . ​ — Leviticus 17 : 11 .
When the time for divine judgment arrives , the “ rest ” will be over .
( b ) How does your understanding of the first resurrection make you feel ?
God’s Word does not disclose a precise date for the first resurrection , but it does reveal that it occurs over a period of time , during Christ’s presence .
We do know , however , that in God’s due time , all the 144,000 will be found standing on the heavenly Mount Zion .
Soon , Satan’s entire world system will be destroyed .
• 1 Corinthians 15 : 23 ; 1 Thessalonians 4 : 15 - 17
• Revelation 6 : 2 , 9 - 11
* We stand to benefit from considering what is stated in these chapters because many of the prophecies in this section are having their major , or final , fulfillment in our day or will be fulfilled in the near future .
36 : 2 , 3 , 22 .
Like Hezekiah , we consider the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the outworking of his purpose more important than our own salvation .
This song of Hezekiah teaches us that nothing is more important in life than to be able to praise Jehovah .
( Isaiah 40 : 1 – 59 : 21 )
“ She [ Jerusalem ] will be rebuilt , ” states Isaiah 44 : 28 .
Babylon will be destroyed .
All of this comes true two centuries later .
It must have pained Jehovah , the compassionate and empathetic God , to see his beloved Son suffer .
53 : 11 ​ — What is the knowledge by means of which the Messiah “ will bring a righteous standing to many people ” ?
56 : 6 ​ — Who are “ the foreigners , ” and in what ways are they “ laying hold of [ Jehovah’s ] covenant ” ?
40 : 10 - 14 , 26 , 28 .
To close our eyes to God’s written Word and to shut our ears to his instruction through “ the faithful and discreet slave ” is to become spiritually blind and deaf . ​ — Matthew 24 : 45 .
We have the backing of Jehovah , who is as stable and firm as a rock .
We should never be afraid to bear witness about his Godship ! ​ — 2 Samuel 22 : 31 , 32 .
44 : 18 - 20 .
46 : 10 , 11 .
They have no peace .
52 : 7 - 9 ; 55 : 12 , 13 .
True worshippers should abound in genuine expressions of godly devotion and acts of brotherly love . ​ — John 13 : 35 ; 2 Peter 3 : 11 .
59 : 15b - 19 .
Isaiah prays to Jehovah in behalf of his countrymen who will be repentant during their exile in Babylon .
63 : 5 ​ — How does God’s rage support him ?
“ Exult , you people , ” said Jehovah , “ and be joyful forever in what I am creating . For here I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation . ” ​ — Isaiah 65 : 18 .
We too live at a time when darkness envelops the earth and the nations are in thick gloom .
[ Footnote ]
“ How comely upon the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news ! ”
Some have read it from cover to cover many times .
Adding to the confusion are the strong disagreements between members of the same religion .
Many view it as a sacred book merely for ceremonial use in making vows or in swearing to tell the truth in court .
In each case , we will take note of what religious leaders mistakenly say , and then we will review what the Bible really teaches .
Another reason why people think that God does not care about us is that religious leaders have made them feel that way .
What do clergymen often say when tragedy strikes ?
Jehovah God never causes what is bad .
Who is behind the wickedness and suffering in this world ?
Humans have unwittingly submitted to God’s Adversary , Satan , for “ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
So we should expect the world to reflect the personality of its ruler .
No wonder there is so much wickedness !
A further reason for suffering is “ time and unforeseen occurrence . ”
Yet , he tells us because he cares about us .
Consider further evidence that God cares about us .
Religious leaders misrepresent God when they say that the tragedies we experience are his will .
They see our globe as little more than a stopover , or stepping - stone , on the way to life somewhere else .
As a result of such teachings , many people have concluded that they are better off living life to the full while they can because only death awaits them .
12 - 14 .
What does the Bible teach regarding God’s purpose for the earth and for mankind ?
God placed the first man and woman , Adam and Eve , in the lovely garden of Eden and supplied them with an abundance of good food .
What Happens to Us at Death ?
But is that the truth ?
16 , 17 .
They no longer earn any wages .
Moreover , “ their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished , ” for they cannot express any emotion . ​ — Ecclesiastes 9 : 5 , 6 , 10 .
When the flame is extinguished , it does not go anywhere .
Think of the implications of that one simple but powerful truth .
Therefore , they cannot be experiencing unbearable loneliness in purgatory or suffering in a place of fiery torment .
Prepare well , do your best to use the book effectively , and pray for God’s help so that you can ‘ handle the word of the truth aright . ’ ​ — 2 Timothy 2 : 15 .
24 , 25 .
Jehovah has granted his people what priceless privileges ?
He has enabled us to learn the truth about him .
After all , God has hidden his purposes from the haughty and has revealed them to humble ones .
Many people thus have an entirely wrong impression of Jehovah , thinking that he is uncaring and hard - hearted .
Do you want honesthearted people everywhere to know the truth about God ?
Truth - seekers need to learn what the Bible really teaches .
• Why are we here on earth ?

Help Others Obey What the Bible Teaches
I love it .
( 2 ) What teaching methods work best ?
( 3 ) How can you help a person to become not only a student but also a teacher of God’s written Word , the Bible ?
Have you read the book from beginning to end ?
The couple gladly gave the woman a copy of the book .
Have you ‘ bought out time ’ to read this publication , possibly a second time , while waiting for an appointment or taking a break at work or at school ?
How can you use the Bible Teach book to start Bible studies ?
After listening carefully to the person’s response , read 2 Timothy 3 : 16 , 17 , and explain that the Bible offers a real solution to mankind’s problems .
The presentation just outlined would take about five minutes to complete .
In those few minutes , however , you will have learned what concerns the householder , read and applied two scriptures , and laid the basis for a return visit .
8 , 9 . ( a ) How can you prepare your Bible student to stand up to the obstacles and tests that he will likely encounter ?
Paul compared these trials to a fire that would destroy inferior building materials but leave such materials as gold , silver , and precious stone unharmed .
Indeed , the Bible contains all the precious materials that can be utilized to build strong faith .
When a man versed in the Law questioned him , Jesus replied : “ What is written in the Law ?
How do you read ? ”
Giving an illustration , Jesus also helped the man see how the teaching should affect him .
Follow his example .
How should the appendix be used ?
For example , if a student finds a subject difficult to grasp or has questions on specific matters because of previously held beliefs , it may suffice to direct his attention to the appropriate section of the appendix and let him consider the subject himself .
If he does so , the student will be strengthened to endure trials and will continue to grow strong in faith .
What can you do to help a student make that kind of spiritual progress ?
For example , encourage him to share what he is learning with a friend or a relative .
By doing so , he will become “ a workman with nothing to be ashamed of , handling the word of the truth aright . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 2 : 15 .

How did Jehovah show his appreciation for the Moabitess Ruth ?
What makes this statement remarkable is that God shows appreciation for devoted people even though they are sinners and fall short of his glory . ​ — Romans 3 : 23 .
4 , 5 .
Being fully aware of our motives and limitations , Jehovah appreciates it when we give him our best , whether that is a little or a lot .
That Jehovah shows his appreciation for those who do his will is repeatedly demonstrated in the Scriptures .
Knowing that Jeremiah was bitterly hated because of the message he preached , Ebed - melech risked his own life and appealed to the king .
Yes , Jehovah delivered Ebed - melech , as well as Jeremiah , from the wicked princes of Judah and later from the Babylonians , who razed Jerusalem .
“ Your Father Who Looks On in Secret Will Repay You ”
“ The prayer of the upright ones is a pleasure to [ God ] , ” noted the wise man .
Jehovah deeply appreciates it when we pray to him from a sincere heart , with no thought of impressing others .
Once , he did this “ early in the morning , while it was still dark . ”
How such conduct makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice ! ​ — Proverbs 27 : 11 ; 1 John 3 : 22 .
12 , 13 .
While some sins can be hidden from humans , we realize that “ all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting . ”
Yes , there is no doubt that Jehovah truly appreciates the person “ who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart . ” ​ — Psalm 15 : 1 , 2 .
How did Jesus ’ response to Mary’s gesture compare with that of others ?
For example , five days before surrendering his life , Jesus and some of his disciples were guests in the home of Simon of Bethany .
He viewed it as an act of great generosity and of deep significance in view of his imminent death and burial .
In fact , Jesus ’ life as a human prepared him for the work Jehovah had in store for him ​ — serving as High Priest and King , first of the congregation of anointed ones and then of the world . ​ — Colossians 1 : 13 ; Hebrews 7 : 26 ; Revelation 11 : 15 .
Before coming to earth , Jesus already had a deep interest in and a special fondness for mankind .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What do the letters to the seven congregations in Asia Minor reveal about Jesus ’ depth of appreciation ?
The letters to the seven congregations are filled with expressions that reflect Jesus ’ full awareness of his disciples ’ challenges and his genuine appreciation for their life of integrity .
They do so by “ rendering [ God ] sacred service day and night . ” ​ — Revelation 7 : 15 - 17 .
The worldwide report for the 2006 service year , set out on pages 27 to 30 , gives clear evidence that these faithful ministers are truly rendering Jehovah “ sacred service day and night . ”
( b ) What will be considered in the following article ?
Describing people living in “ the last days , ” Paul wrote : “ Men will become utterly self - centred , greedy for money . . . They will be utterly lacking in gratitude . ”
• In what ways did Jesus show appreciation ?
As a parent loves her child’s simple expression , Jehovah appreciates it when we give him our best
Why should we appreciate God’s Word , and how did the psalmist voice his appreciation ?
O God , how much does the grand sum of them amount to ! ” ​ — Psalm 139 : 17 .
What shows that David was a man of spiritual depth ?
They are sheeplike ones who “ do not want to share with [ Babylon the Great ] in her sins ” or “ receive part of her plagues . ”
Appreciative Ones Flock to God
Their love of the truth and their desire to serve Jehovah as Kingdom proclaimers give evidence that they truly were drawn by God . ​ — John 6 : 44 , 65 .
10 , 11 .
We never knew that God’s name is Jehovah , and we knew nothing about the Kingdom and the Paradise earth . ”
And it was .
Because Noah “ proceeded to do according to all that God had commanded him .
Of course , our primary work is to preach the good news of God’s established Kingdom and help deserving ones become disciples of Jesus Christ .
By what means does Jehovah provide us with training ?
( Include comments on the chart on pages 27 - 30 . )
What teaching tools has God provided in recent times ?
In recent decades , these have included the books The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life , You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth , Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and , currently , What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
For example , chapter 12 discusses the subject “ Living in a Way That Pleases God . ”
He adds that the book is so easy to use that it “ has given many Kingdom publishers renewed confidence and joy in the ministry .
Relate some experiences that highlight the value of the Bible Teach book .

This woman accepted the offer of a regular Bible study with a local sister and is continuing to make progress .
The Scriptural explanation and the illustration of a teacher and a pupil deeply impressed José .
He began to study in earnest , attended a circuit assembly , and now attends meetings at the local Kingdom Hall .
Roman , a 40 - year - old businessman in Poland , has always had respect for the Word of God .
Nevertheless , he attended a district convention and received a copy of the Bible Teach book .
Thereafter , he made marked improvement .
Roman now studies the Bible regularly and is making fine progress .
How can we continue to show our appreciation for the hope that is set before us ?
There is no better way to show our heartfelt appreciation for this precious hope than by continuing to be cleansed “ from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God . ” ​ — Hebrews 9 : 12 , 14 .
May that appreciation never cease to grow ! ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 58 ; Psalm 110 : 3 .
Easy , Yes , but Accurate ?
After that , the original account describes further acts of creation involving the earth , lasting six “ days , ” or periods of time .
Then , Genesis 2 : 4 sums up the entire period of creation , calling it “ the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven . ”
Would You Welcome a Visit ?
Jesus Christ confirmed this Bible account of the divine origin of marriage , saying to critics of his day : “ Did you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said , ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife , and the two will be one flesh ’ ?
So that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What makes Jesus knowledgeable about marriage ?
An aid to success as a husband is studying what Jesus said and applying what He did .
Yes , God was speaking to the One whom He created before anyone or anything else and who “ came to be beside him as a master worker . ”
Yet , he is , in particular , a model for men .
Hence , the headship principle must be applied if the family is to find success and happiness .
To this end , husbands need to deal with their wives in the loving way that Jesus deals with his figurative wife , his anointed disciples .
How should husbands dwell with their wives ?
In today’s troubled world , husbands especially need to imitate Jesus ’ example of patience , love , and firmness in upholding righteous principles .
With regard to the model Jesus left , we read in the Bible : “ You husbands , continue dwelling in like manner with [ your wives ] according to knowledge . ”
( a ) According to Peter , for what reason should husbands honor their wives ?
The necessity of a husband’s treating his wife with honor is emphasized by the apostle Peter’s concluding words , “ in order for your prayers not to be hindered . ”
How dangerous such a hindrance could be !
On one occasion , Jesus even revealed a most startling truth to women first , telling them to inform the men about it ! ​ — Matthew 28 : 1 , 8 - 10 ; Luke 8 : 1 - 3 .
( b ) How should husbands show love for their wives ?
The Bible , as noted earlier , compares a husband’s relationship with his wife to that of Christ with his “ bride , ” which is his congregation of anointed followers .
In the preceding chapter of Ephesians , “ the congregation ” is called “ the body of the Christ . ”
This symbolic body has many members of both genders , all of whom contribute to the body’s functioning effectively .
How does a husband treat his imperfect physical body , and what does this indicate about how he should treat his wife ?
Husbands should consider not just their own interests but those of their wives . ​ — 1 Corinthians 10 : 24 ; 13 : 5 .
He said : “ Martha , Martha , you are anxious and disturbed about many things .
No doubt his evident affection for Martha made it easy for her to accept his counsel .
As the family head , the husband has the authority and responsibility to correct family members , including his wife .
Good for Husbands to Be Patient
It took ongoing efforts by Jesus to adjust the attitudes of his apostles .
Yet , how rewarding when positive results are realized , as they were among the apostles !
Hence , husbands , reflect on the origin of marriage .
He provided his Son , Jesus , not only as our Ransomer ​ — our Savior — ​ but also as a model for husbands to imitate . ​ — Matthew 20 : 28 ; John 3 : 29 ; 1 Peter 2 : 21 .
[ Picture on page 14 ]
“ Wives be in subjection to [ your ] husbands . ” ​ — EPHESIANS 5 : 22 .
IN MANY lands when a couple gets married , the bride makes a vow , promising that she will deeply respect her husband .
Now , it seems , women swear , drink , smoke , and behave immorally as much as men do .
Has the effort by some women to improve their marital situation made matters better or worse ? ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 .
Caution to Those Who Marry
The reason that a woman in particular should give attention to whom she marries is the Bible’s caution : “ A married woman is bound by law to her husband . ”
A single woman , therefore , needs to ask herself , ‘ Am I willing to enter into an arrangement in which I will come under the law of this man ? ’
The time to consider this question is before getting married , not afterward .
An irrational decision for a mountain climber may cost him his life ; an unwise choice of a marriage mate can likewise be disastrous .
A woman should consider seriously what could be involved in being under the law of a man who proposes to her .
One wise counselor long encouraged young people to get to know the parents of their prospective marriage mate as well as to observe carefully that one’s interaction with parents and other family members .
8 , 9 . ( a ) How did Jesus view his subjection to God ?
When women follow God’s direction to do so , they set an example for the angels in God’s organizational arrangement .
When he was suffering , he did not go threatening . ”
How Wives Can Win Favor
How has submission to unbelieving husbands been beneficial ?
This was illustrated by a wife who learned Bible truths and was determined to attend Christian meetings .
She did not go out “ that door ” but , rather , another one .
The next meeting night , he threatened : “ I won’t be here when you come back . ”
What “ adornment ” is recommended for Christian wives ?
In what ways is Sarah a fine example for Christian wives ?
Peter mentions Sarah , the beautiful wife of Abraham , noting that she “ used to obey Abraham , calling him ‘ lord . ’ ”
Sarah supported her God - fearing husband , whom God had assigned to serve in a distant land .
She gave up a comfortable lifestyle and even put her life in jeopardy .
Why might Peter have had Abigail in mind as an example for Christian wives ?
Abigail was another fearless woman who hoped in God , and Peter may have had her in mind as well .
When Nabal refused to give assistance to David and his men , they prepared to wipe out Nabal and his entire household .
But Abigail took action to save her household .
Many waters themselves are not able to extinguish love , nor can rivers themselves wash it away . ”
Additional Divine Counsel
( b ) What fine example has been provided for wives ?
Finally , consider the context of our theme scripture : “ Wives be in subjection to [ your ] husbands . ”
Why is such subjection necessary ?
For example , in the case of a husband who is an unbeliever , submitting to his headship in all matters that would not mean violating God’s laws or principles may well yield the marvelous reward of her being able to ‘ save her husband . ’

To those who have been taught about the potential dangers , these signs are a warning to seek a place of safety from the impending storm with its lightning and hailstones that may be life threatening .
Why do children need warnings , and why should they obey their parents ?
Lasting Rewards of Obedience
When you honor your parents by obeying them , you also honor God because he is the one who commands you to obey them .
“ I , Jehovah , am your God , the One teaching you to benefit yourself , ” the Bible says .
It makes your mother and father happy , and in turn , they will certainly show their pleasure in ways that will make your life happier .
Jesus was the firstborn of his mother , Mary .
When he was in heaven , before he was miraculously conceived by his virgin mother , as wisdom personified , he explained : “ I came to be beside [ God ] as a master worker , and I came to be the one he was specially fond of day by day . ”
Later , Jesus became a preacher and devoted himself to his ministry to the extent of sacrificing personal comforts .
Do your parents ask you to clean your room or do other chores ?
( a ) With whom may Jesus have traveled to the Passover ?
In what way was Jesus “ questioning ” the teachers ?
The Greek word used here could refer to questioning as used in judicial examination and thus could involve counterquestioning .
“ All those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers , ” the Bible says . ​ — Luke 2 : 47 .
Are you too blessed with parents who study the Bible with you and take you to Christian meetings ?
Jesus Was Submissive
How do you think Mary and Joseph felt when after three days they finally found Jesus in the temple ?
In addition , although not aware of all the details , they would have known something about his future role as Savior and as Ruler of God’s Kingdom .
Obediently , however , Jesus left with his parents and returned home to Nazareth .
Furthermore , “ his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart . ” ​ — Luke 2 : 48 - 51 .
Or do you feel that they often do not understand today’s world and that you know more than they do ?
Granted , you may know more about certain things ​ — perhaps about using cell phones , computers , or other modern gadgets .
You will probably agree that compared with him , you know little .
This does not necessarily mean that he always agreed with their decisions .
“ You’re going with us , aren’t you ? ”
John , although unafraid , said , “ I just have to listen to my mother . ”
On the walkway moments later , he heard screeching tires and looked down just as the girls were hit by a car .
Besides that , your parents have more experience than you do .
True , it may not always be easy to obey your parents , but God says that you should .
That is why after saying “ be obedient to your parents , ” the Bible adds , “ in union with the Lord . ”
Why is obedience easier for someone perfect , yet why would he need to learn about it ?
15 , 16 .
A few hours later , his manner of death on a torture stake was so painful that Jesus uttered “ strong outcries [ with ] tears . ”
Now in heaven , Jesus feels our pain as we often struggle to be obedient . ​ — Proverbs 27 : 11 ; Hebrews 2 : 18 ; 4 : 15 .
Learning the Lesson of Obedience
How should we view receiving discipline ?
Would it not be sad if your parents did not love you enough to take the time and make the effort to correct you ?
Similarly , because Jehovah loves you , he corrects you .
A king in ancient Israel , whom Jesus noted for his great wisdom , spoke of the need for loving , parental correction .
Why especially should you obey your parents ?

Let Us Exalt Jehovah’s Name Together
( a ) Why was David anointed as Israel’s future king ?
David , a skilled musician , was brought to Gibeah to serve the king , and David’s music brought relief to Saul , who “ got to loving him very much . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 16 : 11 , 13 , 21 , 23 .
Twice while David was playing his harp before Saul , the king hurled his spear at him .
Evidently , David was accompanied in his flight by an escort of young men , and David sought refreshments for them and for himself .
Perhaps David reasoned that Gath would be the last place that Saul would look for him .
( a ) What does Psalm 56 tell us about David’s experience in Gath ?
He acted as if he were insane .
9 , 10 .
In the first seven verses of the psalm , David praises God for delivering him and invites his supporters to join him in exalting Jehovah as the Great Rescuer of His people . ​ — Psalm 34 : 3 , 4 , 7 .
What reasons do we have to praise Jehovah constantly ?
Living as an outcast , David must have had many material concerns , but as these words show , his daily cares did not overshadow his determination to praise Jehovah .
What a fine example for us when we face hardships !
This means that the end of this system of things is close .
Surely our priority in life should be to use every opportunity to encourage others to accept this “ good news ” before it is too late . ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 .
( a ) In whom did David boast , and what kind of people responded ?
Similarly , Jesus Christ , the Greater David , took delight in praising Jehovah publicly ​ — at the local synagogue , at festivals at God’s temple in Jerusalem , and in company with his followers .
How has Jehovah used his angels to come to our rescue ?
Why ?

Even as a fugitive , David exalted Jehovah’s name
“ Fear Jehovah , you holy ones of his , for there is no lack to those fearing him . ” ​ — PSALM 34 : 9 .
Why Fear God
( a ) How do you view the command to fear God ?
Fear Jehovah , you holy ones of his , for there is no lack to those fearing him . ”
Notice that as it applied in his day , David dignified his men by calling them “ holy ones . ”
They were part of God’s holy nation .
Although they were on the run from King Saul , David was confident that Jehovah would continue supplying their basic needs .
David wrote : “ The maned young lions themselves have had little on hand and gone hungry ; but as for those seeking Jehovah , they will not lack anything good . ”
( b ) What counsel did Jesus give on the matter of fear ?
To do so , they would need to cultivate the fear of Jehovah , not of men .
Speaking of him , the prophetic Word foretold : “ Upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down , the spirit . . . of the fear of Jehovah ; and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah . ”
As noted earlier , fearing Jehovah does not deprive us of joy .
Instead , we use our time to do what is good .
What can be done today when a situation threatens to disturb the peace of the congregation ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What present benefits do fearers of God enjoy ?
How distressed he must have been to recall that it was his visit to Nob that provoked Saul’s wrath !
We know that nothing our enemies do can cause us lasting harm .
David expressed similar conviction in these words : “ He is guarding all the bones of [ the righteous ] one ; not one of them has been broken . ”
Though Jesus was cruelly put to death , not one of his bones was “ crushed . ”
Their bones will never be crushed , figuratively speaking . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
What calamity awaits unrepentant haters of Jehovah’s people ?
All who continue to oppose God’s people face the worst possible calamity .
In what sense are the “ great crowd ” already redeemed , and what will they experience in the future ?

An Event to Remember !
It was Nisan 14 of the year 33 C.E .
Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting .
How to Identify True Worship
God’s Word says : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
The Holy Scriptures illuminate God’s love still further when they describe how God has provided a perfect government in the hands of Jesus to restore peace to obedient mankind . ​ — Daniel 7 : 13 , 14 ; 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
The Bible claims to be inspired of God .
The Bible says : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments . ”
Only one body of true Christians walks unitedly with God on the road of true worship .

A record of these and other judgment proclamations appears in the second - largest book of the Bible , the book of Jeremiah .
Jeremiah’s work as a prophet and the attitude of the people toward his message find parallels in our day .
Moreover , the record of how Jehovah dealt with his people highlights his qualities and should have a profound effect on us . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
“ I will make Jerusalem piles of stones , ” declares Jehovah , “ and the cities of Judah I shall make a desolate waste , without an inhabitant . ”
Why ?
The message is also about the restoration of a repentant remnant .
While pagan nations westward to Kittim and eastward to Kedar might bring in deities of other nations to add to their own , the idea of totally replacing their gods with foreign ones was unheard of .
However , the Israelites abandoned Jehovah , exchanging the glory of the living God for lifeless idols .
Moreover , after its fall , the interests of the ten - tribe kingdom continued to be represented in Jerusalem , since the messages of God’s prophets continued to include the Israelites .
Jehovah did not prevent them from proclaiming misleading messages .
We should walk by faith , not by sight . ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 7 .
Like Jeremiah , we can fight discouragement .
We can do so by rejoicing in meaningful personal Bible study , by exalting Jehovah’s name in the ministry , and by avoiding bad associations .
17 : 1 , 2 .
When it comes to such matters as salvation and genuine peace and security , we are wise to put our trust in Jehovah alone . ​ — Psalm 146 : 3 .
To King Zedekiah , Jeremiah says : “ Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon . ”
However , “ the One scattering Israel will himself collect him [ Israel ] together . ”
Similarly , the Scriptural message regarding the coming destruction of Christendom is a burden to Christendom , and the people who give no heed are wearisome to God .

Lessons for Us :
Even at the last hour , Jehovah provided a choice for the unrepentant inhabitants of Jerusalem , who deserved to die .
45 : 4 , 5 .
On the seventh day of the fifth month of the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign , Nebuzaradan , the chief of the bodyguard , ‘ comes to , ’ or arrives at , Jerusalem .
Three days later , on the tenth of the month , he ‘ comes into , ’ or enters , Jerusalem .
And he proceeds to set the city aflame . ​ — Jeremiah 52 : 12 , 13 .
He beholds thrilling events as “ by inspiration ” he comes to be in “ the Lord’s day . ”
He is none other than Jesus Christ .
Tell me , if you do know understanding . . . .
Who laid its cornerstone , when the morning stars joyfully cried out together , and all the sons of God began shouting in applause ? ”
What are some ways in which these spirit creatures affect humans ? ​ — Revelation 5 : 11 .
What does the meaning of the original - language words for “ angel ” show about one of the roles angels play ?
Back in the time of the Judges in Israel , for example , Manoah and his barren wife earnestly desired a child .
Jehovah sent his angel to inform Manoah’s wife that she would have a son .
Angels do not visit individuals in the same way today , but like Manoah , parents can seek Jehovah’s mind when training their children . ​ — Ephesians 6 : 4 .
There was an impressive example of angelic support in the days of Elisha the prophet .
One day when Elisha’s servant got up early in the morning and looked outside , he saw that the city was surrounded by horses and war chariots .
How did angels support Jesus ?
In anguish , Jesus bent his knees and began to pray , saying : “ ‘ Father , if you wish , remove this cup from me . Nevertheless , let , not my will , but yours take place . ’
Angelic Support in Modern Times
When we consider the modern - day history of the preaching work of Jehovah’s Witnesses , do we not see evidence of angelic support ?
15 , 16 .
There we read : “ I [ the apostle John ] saw another angel flying in midheaven , and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth , and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people , saying in a loud voice : ‘ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived , and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters . ’ ”
The angels have also guided the Witnesses to deserving ones .
How did the Assyrians fare against just one angel ?
Back in the eighth century B.C.E . , for example , Jerusalem was threatened by a vast horde of Assyrian soldiers .
The Bible account tells us what happened : “ It came about on that night that the angel of Jehovah proceeded to go out and strike down a hundred and eighty - five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . When people rose up early in the morning , why , there all of them were dead carcasses . ”
Very soon now , Jesus will come “ with his powerful angels in a flaming fire . ”
What an effect this action will have on mankind !
Only those who seek Jehovah , righteousness , and meekness will be “ concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger ” and be unharmed . ​ — Zephaniah 2 : 3 .
The following article will discuss what measures true Christians can take to protect themselves from the powerful influence of Satan the Devil and his demons .
• How did angels come into existence ?
[ Picture on page 23 ]
1 , 2 .
What questions arise about Satan the Devil and the demons ?
Satan has maligned Jehovah throughout history .
“ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one , ” states 1 John 5 : 19 .
Satan is “ a liar and the father of the lie , ” but he portrays himself as “ an angel of light . ”
How can we resist Satan and his wicked angels ?
Paul twice urges his fellow Christians to put on “ the complete suit of armor from God . ”
So , what are the vital components of the spiritual armor that Christians today urgently require in order to resist the demons ?
Paul explains : “ Stand firm , therefore , with your loins girded about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness . ”
The two pieces of armor referred to here are a girdle , or a belt , and a breastplate .
If so , we are endeavoring to apply Paul’s counsel .
Keeping a tight hold on the truth can help us make wise decisions and protect us from following a wrong course .
( b ) What “ burning missiles ” can have a detrimental effect on our faith ?
The advice to take up the large shield of faith is introduced with the expression “ above all things , ” indicating that this piece of armor is very important .
They could be penetrating insults , lies , and half - truths put out by enemies and apostates trying to weaken our faith .
We can draw close to God by means of regular personal study of the Bible and by earnest prayers .
Likewise , our Christian hope protects our mental powers .
Our final protection against the influence of Satan and his demons is God’s word , or message , recorded in the Bible .
The removal of Satan , his demons , and the wicked world is near .
It is vital that we resist Satan and his demons .

How can I safeguard my health ?
What can I do to make my family life happier ?
You are certainly not alone in seeking good advice on how to deal with everyday life .
Regarding the advice found in this avalanche of publications , one author said : “ Many new books merely repeat what has already been written . ”
The Bible plainly states : “ All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight , for disciplining in righteousness . ”
Even so , the Bible has much to say about how to cope with the problems common to us all , and it promises that those who follow its direction will learn to benefit themselves .
The Bible can “ give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness , to a young man knowledge and thinking ability . ”
Wine is described as making “ the heart of mortal man rejoice . ”
Included in this huge financial burden are “ healthcare costs ( € 279 million ) , costs of road accidents ( € 315 million ) , costs of alcohol - related crime ( € 100 million ) , loss of output due to alcohol - related work absences ( € 1034 million ) , ” says the report .
During the 20th century , smoking took the life of an estimated 100 million people , almost as many as were killed in all the wars of that century .
Indeed , the wisdom of avoiding tobacco is now widely accepted .
Contrary to what many have been led to believe , the Bible does not prudishly condemn as sinful all sexual desire .
Sex provides a way for marriage mates to express and receive love and tender affection .
After reviewing statistics of the past several decades , researcher Robert Lerman wrote : “ The shift toward single - parent families may have contributed to a higher incidence of other social problems , such as higher rates of school dropouts , of alcohol and drug use , of adolescent pregnancy and childbearing , and of juvenile delinquency . ”
Those who are sexually promiscuous also face major health risks , both physical and mental .
The Bible does more than just warn against destructive habits .
Do you not feel that a wife who follows this advice when she speaks to ​ — or about — ​ her husband will be deeply loved by him ?
* ​ — Ephesians 6 : 1 , 2 .
“ Before kings is where he will station himself . ”
The Bible encourages workers to be honest and diligent . “ Let the stealer steal no more , but rather let him do hard work , doing with his hands what is good work . ”
For employers , the Bible provides this reminder : “ The workman is worthy of his wages . ”
God’s Law to the Israelites directed that employers provide prompt and fair payment to their workers .

Following the Bible’s advice improves family life
Jehovah “ raised him up from the dead and . . . made him head over all things to the congregation , which is his body . ” ​ — Ephesians 1 : 20 - 23 .
He closely observes the spiritual condition of each group of Christians , or congregation .
A Faithful Slave
After his resurrection and shortly before his ascension to his Father in heaven , Jesus told his disciples : “ All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth . ” He also said : “ Look !
In line with Malachi’s prophecy , the composite sign that Jesus gave his disciples to enable them to recognize the time of his “ presence and of the conclusion of the system of things ” included the identification of a collective “ slave . ”
Jesus stated : “ Who really is the faithful steward , the discreet one , whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time ?
A Representative Governing Body
What decision - making body existed in the first century , and with what effect on the congregations ?
* We can have confidence in such faithful anointed Christians .
Another Scriptural reason for showing respect for the faithful slave is that anointed Christians on earth are figuratively spoken of as a “ temple ” that Jehovah inhabits “ by spirit . ”
Indeed , the “ other sheep ” count it a real privilege to assist the slave class in caring for the Master’s interests . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
What has the Governing Body found it necessary to do , and what will be considered in the following article ?
• At the “ temple ” inspection , who were found to be acting as a faithful slave , and what belongings were entrusted to them ?
[ Pictures on page 23 ]
That prophecy of restoration was first fulfilled when a Jewish remnant returned to Judah in 537 B.C.E .
It was again fulfilled when the anointed remnant were delivered from “ Babylon the Great ” in 1919 by the Greater Cyrus , Jesus Christ .
Jesus himself stated : “ I am the fine shepherd , and I know my sheep and my sheep know me . ” ​ — John 10 : 14 .
Both Jehovah and Jesus deplored the ruthlessness of the shepherds , or leaders , of Israel , who shamelessly neglected and exploited their flocks .
And I will raise up over them one shepherd , and he must feed them , even my servant David .
These “ gifts in men ” are overseers , or elders , appointed by Jehovah and his Son , through holy spirit , to shepherd the sheep with tenderness .
What does Paul invite us to “ contemplate , ” and how should we “ be obedient ” ?
We will certainly be happy if we willingly accept their leadership .
Why is it necessary for us to “ be submissive ” in addition to being obedient ?
That is where submission comes into play .
In what way have overseers “ spoken the word of God ” to their fellow Christians in the first century and today ?
Recall that the “ gifts in men ” that Jesus gives to the congregation are for “ the readjustment of the holy ones . ”
Our obedience to the appointed elders also gives evidence of our submission to Christ , the Head of the congregation . ​ — Colossians 2 : 19 .
With their weighty responsibilities of teaching , shepherding , taking the lead in the preaching work , raising their families , and handling problems in the congregation , Christian elders carry a heavy load .
If we fail to cooperate with them , we only add to their load .
May we continue to show our appreciation for their hard work through our willing cooperation , our obedience , and our submission .

An Invitation to a Special Talk You Can Feel Safe in This Troubled World !
What has caused billions worldwide to feel unsafe ?
Learn the answers by being present at this important Bible talk to be delivered in tens of thousands of locations .
We sincerely invite you to attend this timely and encouraging Bible talk .
Let the Congregation Praise Jehovah
About which congregation was Paul speaking ?
And what bearing should this have on our life and prospects ?
To see , let us first examine uses of the term “ congregation ” in God’s Word .
But the Bible generally uses it for the Christian congregation .
These 144,000 anointed ones constitute “ the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens . ” ​ — Hebrews 12 : 23 .
We find in the historical report that three thousand did so , thereupon becoming part of the new and growing congregation of God .
We can be sure , though , that their Head , Jesus Christ , loves them .
Hardly .
Thus , when we read that Herod was “ mistreating some of those of the congregation , ” it may refer to more than a single group that gathered in Jerusalem . ​ — Acts 12 : 1 .
There was more than one such congregation in that sizable Roman province .
How was the operation of holy spirit manifested in some early congregations ?
Some manifestations of such gifts were special speech of wisdom or knowledge , the power to heal or to prophesy , or even the ability to make utterances in tongues unknown to them . ​ — 1 Corinthians 12 : 4 - 11 .
What was one objective of miraculous gifts of the spirit ?
Recall that the apostle Paul urged Christians in the local congregation in Philippi , Macedonia : “ This is what I continue praying , that [ you ] may be filled with righteous fruit , which is through Jesus Christ , to God’s glory and praise . ”
What questions might be asked about “ the congregation of God ” ?
How would “ the congregation of God ” be arranged ?
How would it function on earth , wherever its members lived ?
And how are our lives and happiness involved ?
This is not the way among you ; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister , and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all . ”
4 , 5 .
A key assignment would be to give spiritual instruction to those in the congregation .
These sheep ​ — Christian men , women , and children — ​ would need to be spiritually fed and properly shepherded .
Another notable detail in the historical record is that some qualified men were designated to help in caring for certain practical matters .
( b ) What resulted when instruction was provided through the congregations ?
After deliberation and with the help of the holy spirit , they reached a conclusion in harmony with the Scriptures .
The Bible outlines what roles for qualified Christian men ?
Take , for example , the congregations on the island of Crete .
They lived in various cities , and all were a long distance from the governing body in Jerusalem .
Fittingly , the older men , or overseers , would represent the local congregation in handling or resolving problems or in addressing cases of sin .
What responsibility do elders have toward the congregation ?
The elders and all others in the congregation are imperfect , so from time to time , misunderstandings or problems occur , as they did in the first century when some of the apostles were still present .
Or we may think that something unscriptural is happening , but it seems that although the local elders are aware of it , they do not correct the matter .
Of course , it may be that the issue has been or is being handled in accord with the Scriptures and in the light of facts of which we are unaware .
In modern times , some have ceased associating with the local congregation , feeling that they will serve God on their own .
They may say that it is because their feelings were hurt , they think a wrong is not being corrected , or they cannot accept some teaching .
While it is true that each Christian should have a personal relationship with God , we cannot deny that he is using a worldwide congregation , as he did in the apostles ’ day .
Significantly , when Paul wrote to the congregation in Colossae and directed that the letter be read also in Laodicea , he spoke of being “ rooted and being built up in [ Christ ] . ”
Pillar and Support of Truth
Similarly , the worldwide Christian congregation is God’s household , “ a pillar and support of the truth . ”
He wrote that he desired that what was said at their meetings be clear and understandable so that those attending could be “ built up . ”
Bible scholar Albert Barnes recognized that Jesus ’ direction to “ speak to the congregation ” could mean “ those who are authorized to try such cases ​ — the representatives of the church , or those who act for them .
In the Jewish synagogue there was a bench of elders , before whom trials of this kind were brought . ”
• What do elders , though imperfect , do for the congregation ?
SOME 2,000 years ago , the Bible writer Paul described Jehovah as “ the God who supplies endurance and comfort . ”
God gives strength to those who turn to him in prayer , asking for his help .
If you likewise pray to Jehovah in faith , the great God of heaven will sustain you .
After all , Jehovah God promises those who strive to serve him : “ I , Jehovah your God , am grasping your right hand , the One saying to you , ‘ Do not be afraid .
I myself will help you . ’ ” ​ — Isaiah 41 : 13 .
According to Proverbs 18 : 1 , “ one isolating himself ” may come to harm .
At the family’s home , Jesus went in to the lifeless girl .
Taking her by the hand , he said : “ Maiden , I say to you , Get up ! ”
“ Immediately the maiden rose and began walking . ”
“ They were beside themselves with great ecstasy . ”
If you have lost a son or a daughter in death , please know that Jehovah can change your sorrow into joy by means of the resurrection .
To benefit from this glorious prospect , obey the psalmist’s exhortation : “ Search for Jehovah and his strength . Seek his face constantly .
What will be the immediate result if you “ search for Jehovah ” ?
[ Box on page 5 ]
Even so , their trust in Jehovah sustains them , and they continue sharing the Bible’s message of hope with their neighbors .
One day a woman named Mrs . Ukoli said to one of Bintu’s friends : “ Bring the woman who lost two children at the same time and is still preaching the Bible’s message .
I want to know what gives her the power to endure . ”
Bintu used the Bible to explain the reason why people die and why we can have the sure hope that dead loved ones will be resurrected . ​ — Acts 24 : 15 ; Romans 5 : 12 .
Are you afraid that if you start to cry , you will contribute to their sadness ?
But avoid intruding in the private areas of their home or in their lives .
❖ Much time will pass before a semblance of normalcy returns to the home .
Initially , there is often a flurry of attention given to a bereaved family , but they need more .
pages 20 - 4 of the brochure When Someone You Love Dies , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses . [ Pictures on page 7 ]
Why have most humans not succeeded in finding true peace and happiness ?
CAN you recall an occasion when you had to ask someone for directions ?
In either case , would it not be wise to follow the direction of someone who knew the area ?
They simply cannot find the road to true peace and happiness .
More than 2,500 years ago , the prophet Jeremiah stated : “ It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step . ”
Why is Jehovah God supremely qualified to provide direction for mankind , and what does he promise ?
Jehovah God is supremely qualified to provide such direction .
Thus , we can fully trust his promise as recorded at Psalm 32 : 8 : “ I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go . I will give advice with my eye upon you . ”
There is no doubt about it : Jehovah provides the best direction .
4 , 5 .
A psalmist said in prayer to Jehovah : “ Your word is a lamp to my foot , and a light to my roadway . ”
Let us see in greater detail how God’s utterances as found in the Bible can be a lamp to our foot and a light to our roadway .
Here is where another Scriptural principle enters the picture .
Some Bible translations render those words “ do not team up , ” “ do not try to work together as equals , ” or “ stop forming inappropriate relationships . ”
When does it cross the line and become an uneven yoking ?
On one occasion , Jesus stated : “ You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you . ”
Does he or she have the same moral standards that I as a Christian have ? ’
Cite situations in which God’s utterances should guide our steps .
Psalm 119 : 105 also states that God’s utterances can light our roadway , illuminating the path ahead .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Since all these things are thus to be dissolved , what sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion , awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah ! ” ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 11 , 12 .
Our thinking and our lifestyle should reflect our firm conviction that “ the world is passing away and so is its desire . ”
How did one Christian family expand their ministry ?
About 20 are from the United States , while the rest come from the Bahamas , Canada , Italy , New Zealand , and Spain .
They arrive eager to engage in the ministry and have had a tremendous impact on the enthusiasm of the local brothers . ”
Understandably , many are not in a position to move to another land to serve where there is a greater need .
But those who are ​ — or who can adjust their circumstances to make themselves available — ​ will surely experience numerous blessings by sharing in this aspect of the ministry .
And they light our roadway , enabling us to see clearly what lies ahead .
They are truly ‘ training themselves with godly devotion as their aim . ’ ​ — 1 Timothy 4 : 7 , 8 .
What questions will be considered in this article ?
Timothy grew up in Lystra , a small town in the Roman province of Galatia .
Benefit From Positive Influences
His father was a Greek , and his mother , Eunice , and his grandmother Lois were of Jewish origin .
If your parents encourage you to focus on spiritual goals , give careful consideration to their advice .
They have your best interests at heart . ​ — Proverbs 1 : 5 .
Timothy became well - known to the Christian elders in his own congregation and to those in Iconium , some 20 miles [ 30 km ] away .
Paul’s letters indicate that Timothy welcomed advice and that he was quick to imitate examples of faith .
Yes , Timothy closely followed Paul’s example .
Similarly , if you draw close to spiritually strong individuals in the congregation , you will be helped to develop sound spiritual goals . ​ — 2 Timothy 2 : 20 – 22 .
Like Timothy , you need to make a careful examination of “ the holy writings . ”
Studying may not be your favorite activity , but remember that Timothy had to ‘ train himself with godly devotion as his aim . ’
Similarly , reaching spiritual goals requires sacrifice and serious effort .
Let us consider three ways .
Why will the Scriptures motivate you to reach spiritual goals ?
Give an illustration .
“ My parents took me to the Kingdom Hall , ” she relates , “ but I did not do personal study or listen at the meetings . ”
( b ) Give examples of the practical wisdom contained in God’s Word .
It will nurture in you essential qualities , such as humility , perseverance , industriousness , and genuine love for fellow Christians .
Giving priority to goals that honor Jehovah is the wisest course but by no means the easiest .
Like Timothy , you will need to “ fight the fine fight of the faith ” in order to “ get a firm hold on the everlasting life ” that Jehovah holds out to you . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 12 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 12 .
His father may well have expected him to seek higher education and to continue a family business .
Young Christians today face similar challenges .
“ I have seen Jehovah provide for me , encourage me , and protect me from bad decisions , ” says Matthew .
‘ Why be a pioneer ? ’
You can do the same .
Timothy witnessed firsthand the formation of new congregations as the good news spread to almost all of the northern Mediterranean area .
By pursuing spiritual goals , you too will reap priceless spiritual blessings .
Instead of the pain and frustration that result from pursuing material wealth , you will enjoy the genuine happiness that comes from unselfish giving .
So if you have not already done so , we warmly encourage you to begin immediately to train yourself with godly devotion as your aim .
Draw close to those in the congregation who can help you reach out for spiritual goals , and seek their guidance .
Make regular personal study of God’s Word a priority .
And always remember that the God “ who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment ” promises you that you can have rich blessings both now and in the future if you choose goals that honor him . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 17 .
All other advantages are human , and trivial , and not worth our serious concern . ” ​ — Moralia , I , “ The Education of Children . ”
Do You Remember ?
• Where can young ones find help to reach out for spiritual goals ?
Timothy pursued fine goals
[ Pictures on page 25 ]
Just as parents make an important difference in the lives of their offspring , so children make a great difference in the lives of their parents .
He wrote : “ A wise son is the one that makes a father rejoice , and a stupid son is the grief of his mother . ”
Why is this appropriate ?
Would it not stand to reason , then , that if there is “ no greater cause for thankfulness ” for parents than to hear that their children “ go on walking in the truth , ” the opposite is also true ?
What deep sorrow parents experience when a child forsakes the worship of the true God !
Your behavior deeply touches your parents ’ hearts .
Many , however , turn away from such a hope .
They dismiss it as an illusion , an unrealistic dream for gullible people .
What difficult question can we help people to answer , and why are we in a unique position to do so ?
We see why many do not believe in the Bible’s promises .
What may we need to do first when someone raises the question of why God permits suffering ?
When someone asks why God allows suffering , how do we respond ?
A word of caution is in order , though .
6 , 7 .
Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful , and you keep looking upon mere trouble ?
On the contrary , Jehovah saw fit to have their sincere questions recorded in his Word .
What a privilege it is to help such ones find the happiness that Jesus promised !
They dishonor God and make him out to be responsible for the wickedness and suffering in the world .
What are some tools that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” has provided in order to help people understand why Jehovah God permits suffering ?
Make full use of such tools .
The Bible thus says : “ Perfect is his activity . ”
How can you bring these qualities to the fore as you answer questions that are often raised on this issue ?
( b ) Why will Jehovah not tolerate sin forever ?
However , when people ask about forgiveness in the matter , they may actually be wondering why Jehovah did not simply lower his standard and tolerate the existence of sin and rebellion .
The Bible emphasizes Jehovah’s holiness hundreds of times .
13 , 14 .
Because of his love of justice , Jehovah refrained from wiping out the rebels in Eden .
The immediate execution of the rebels , while well - deserved , would not have provided such an answer .
Jehovah’s justice would never allow for such an outcome , for his purpose is always accomplished . ​ — Isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 .
Some people might propose their own “ solutions ” to the rebellion in Eden .
In doing so , however , would they not be suggesting that they could think of better ways to handle the issue ?
In writing to Christians in Rome , the apostle Paul delved deeply into God’s wisdom , including the “ sacred secret ” regarding Jehovah’s purpose to use the Messianic Kingdom to bring about the redemption of faithful mankind and to sanctify His holy name .
With those striking words , the Bible identifies Jehovah’s dominant quality , the quality that is the most appealing of them all and the most comforting for those troubled by the prevalence of wickedness .
Love moved Jehovah to give hope to the sinful offspring of Adam and Eve , providing them with a means to approach Him and come into an approved relationship with Him .
And love has moved him to be patient with mankind , giving as many as possible the opportunity to reject Satan and choose Jehovah as their Sovereign . ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 9 .
In fact , he has promised to do so .
[ Picture on page 21 ]
Seek to help those who are troubled by the suffering in the world
Why does death seem certain ?
On our own , none of us can avoid it in the long run .
It pursues us all .
For some , though , death is less certain than many today realize .
Moreover , “ death is to be brought to nothing . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 .
First , what makes this hope so certain ?
But Jehovah promised that his “ woman , ” or wifelike organization in heaven , would produce a “ seed ” who would bruise that “ original serpent ” in the head , crushing Satan out of existence .
However , by means of the resurrection , Jehovah will expose all such lies for what they are .
You will call , and I myself shall answer you .
What do those words mean ?
He viewed that time as “ compulsory service , ” an enforced period of waiting for release .
Because he knew of Jehovah’s feelings .
Our hope for the future is guaranteed by the resurrection of Jesus .
Perhaps the thought that this hope is guaranteed caught their attention .
Jesus himself said : “ I am the resurrection and the life . ”
This evidence that Jesus was sent by God was so forceful that Jesus ’ religious enemies never denied that it had happened .
Finding Comfort in the Resurrection Hope
What will help us to draw comfort from the Bible’s resurrection accounts ?
Jehovah has already used Elijah to perform a prolonged miracle to reward the faith of this humble widow .
What will the prophet do ?
Imagine the joy spreading over Elijah’s face as he sees the boy’s chest heave with the intake of air .
Elijah brings the boy down to his mother and says : “ See , your son is alive . ”
She says : “ Now , indeed , I do know that you are a man of God and that Jehovah’s word in your mouth is true . ”
Happily , Jehovah does not want that to happen to you .
We realize that ‘ whether we live or we die , we belong to Jehovah . ’
Because they view life as being short , they seem almost desperate in their pursuit of pleasure , and if they have a form of worship , it certainly does not harmonize with the “ perfect will of God . ”
( b ) Why are we moved to praise Jehovah daily ?
“ It must quickly pass by , and away we fly , ” perhaps in some 70 or 80 years .
Humans come and go like green grass , like a passing shadow , like an exhalation .
Is God cruel , giving us such a desire and then making it impossible to fulfill it ?
We need not be frantic , driven to reach our full potential right now .
By all means , then , let us daily praise Jehovah , who makes the resurrection hope a certainty !
Said a professor who has written extensively on the subject of evil : “ I have had a very strong need to make a difference in the world , to improve the world .
But the world is not visibly improving . ”
Perhaps you feel similarly .
Is it possible that mankind is being manipulated by an unseen but powerful and sinister force ?
If so , what is it , and how can we protect ourselves ?
The following article will address these questions .

The Source of Evil Exposed !
Logically , the Jewish religious leaders should have been the first to welcome Jesus , listen to him , and joyfully accept his direction .
Jesus rightly condemned those reprehensible men .
When he speaks the lie , he speaks according to his own disposition , because he is a liar and the father of the lie . ”
Why did Satan rebel against Jehovah ?
By uttering the first lie ever spoken and by slandering Jehovah , Satan made himself “ the father of the lie . ”
So by drawing attention to the sexual union of “ the sons of the true God ” who materialized and took “ the daughters of men , ” the account clearly refers to something unprecedented , abnormal .
By appealing to mankind’s sinful inclination and desires .
“ All flesh . . . ruined its way on the earth . ”
Satan and his demons thus promote and aggravate the evil perpetrated by humans .
You also need to shield your heart from the love of violence , for the Devil knows that “ anyone loving violence [ Jehovah ] certainly hates . ”
It is no coincidence that violence , often with occult themes , saturates the popular media .
The forces of evil can appear formidable .
The apostle Paul wrote to first - century Christians : “ We received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is from God . ”
How so ?
If so , then you can take comfort in the promises contained in the Bible .

Legends With a Kernel of Truth
“ Jeremiah sat down weeping and lamented with this lamentation over Jerusalem , ” says the Greek Septuagint in its introduction to the book of Lamentations .
Composed in 607 B.C.E . while the memory of the 18 - month - long siege followed by the burning of Jerusalem is still fresh in the prophet’s mind , the book of Lamentations vividly expresses Jeremiah’s heartfelt anguish .
The book of Lamentations is a collection of five lyrical poems .
How she that was a princess among the jurisdictional districts has come to be for forced labor ! ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
1 : 15 ​ — How had Jehovah “ trodden the very winepress belonging to the virgin daughter of Judah ” ?
In destroying the city , described as a virgin , the Babylonians shed blood in such quantity that it was comparable to the squeezing of grapes in a winepress .
2 : 1 , 6 ​ — What is Jehovah’s “ footstool ” and his “ booth ” ?
The psalmist sang : “ Let us come into his grand tabernacle ; let us bow down at his footstool . ”
The reversal of the same two characters is also found in songs 3 and 4 of Lamentations . ​ — Lamentations 3 : 46 , 49 ; 4 : 16 , 17 .
The reference here is apparently to Leviticus 26 : 17 , which states : “ I shall indeed set my face against you , and you will certainly be defeated before your enemies ; and those who hate you will just tread down upon you , and you will actually flee when no one is pursuing you . ”
In punishing transgressors , Jehovah is always just and righteous .
How unwise to choose a course of disobedience to God !
Jeremiah pours out his feelings over the terrible effects of the 18 - month siege of Jerusalem and laments : “ The punishment for the error of the daughter of my people also becomes greater than the punishment for the sin of Sodom , which was overthrown as in a moment , and to which no hands turned helpfully . ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
However , consequences of errors can linger on and be experienced by later generations .
For example , ancient Israel’s turning to idolatry made it difficult even for the faithful Israelites of later times to adhere to the course of righteousness . ​ — Exodus 20 : 5 .
Why ?
We should not forget that Jehovah is abundant in acts of loving - kindness and that many are his mercies .
3 : 27 .
But it is ‘ good for an able - bodied man to carry the yoke during his youth . ’
Why ?
3 : 39 - 42 .
Make Jehovah Your Confidence
Jehovah’s evaluation of Jerusalem’s situation as expressed in the book of Lamentations teaches us two vital lessons .

For many years now , Harry has also given district convention talks in his new language .
Rather , it is in the spirit of what the apostle Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians concerning faithful congregation elders : “ As you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith . ”
Barzillai the Gileadite is a fine example in this regard .
At 80 years of age , he showed extraordinary hospitality to David and his army , providing them with food and lodging during Absalom’s rebellion .
When David was returning to Jerusalem , Barzillai escorted the entourage to the Jordan River .
Could your servant taste what I ate and what I drank , or could I listen anymore to the voice of male and female singers ? . . .
Though he recognized that his sense of taste and of hearing were no longer what they had been , he was not bitter .
Instead , by unselfishly recommending that Chimham receive the benefits offered , Barzillai revealed the kind of man that he was at heart .
Though David’s circumstances changed many times over the years , he remained convinced that Jehovah’s care for his loyal servants never changes .
Toward the end of his life , David composed the song known today as Psalm 37 .
What depth of feeling that adds to those heartfelt words !
Yet , his work was not finished .
In fact , all the writings in the Bible that were penned by John were written in the final years of his life .
It is generally thought that he was released from exile during the reign of Roman Emperor Nerva .
Jesus said : “ By endurance on your part you will acquire your souls . ”
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
Jehovah treasures your whole - souled service regardless of how much or how little you can do .
What should elderly servants of God appreciate , and what will we now consider ?
The elder who made that visit is now in his 80 ’ s , and he fondly remembers that brother’s sense of humor and his loyalty .
Thus , it is probable that his language was not changed when the rebels had their language confused .
Imagine being told to leave your home , your friends , the country of your birth , and the security of your extended family to go to a land that you do not know .
Though Jehovah had said that Abraham would become “ a great nation , ” he died long before his offspring became numerous .
Clearly , aged loyal servants of God can have a wholesome influence on their family members .
Scriptural instruction combined with the voice of experience and an example of endurance can make a real difference in determining whether a young person will grow up with solid faith .

How might elderly ones today imitate Samuel in the matter of prayer ?
Older ones , do you appreciate just how much your prayers benefit the congregation ?
Some of our brothers are in prison on account of their Christian neutrality .
Still others stood firm for true worship while living under dictatorial regimes .

O God , how much does the grand sum of them amount to !
“ We are also unique in our profound curiosity about ourselves : How are we put together physically ? How were we formed ? ”
What Faith Involves
The same is true of us .
We will never understand everything about all of God’s creative works .
Illustrate how faith and our relationship with God are linked .
Having faith involves more than merely acknowledging that life and the universe must have had an intelligent Source .
It makes us want to learn ever more about him and to praise him forever out of unselfish love and devotion .
That is the most noble purpose that anyone can pursue . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 1 , 2 .

What spirit permeates today’s society ?
Therefore , Moses told them : “ You people must take care to do just as Jehovah your God has commanded you . ”
How important is our obedience to the Creator of the universe ?
God once had the prophet Samuel tell King Saul : “ To obey is better than a sacrifice . ”
In what sense can we give something to Jehovah ?
That being the case , is there anything that we can give him ?
Suppose a diabetic failed to stick to the healthy diet that had been prescribed for his good and kept eating what was bad for him .
We need “ an obedient heart ” if we are to discern between good and bad in a world permeated with the spirit of disobedience .
A Warning Example
The Bible record of King Saul underlines the vital importance of obedience .
On one occasion , Saul was to face the Philistines in battle .
Seeing that , Saul “ went offering up the burnt sacrifice . ”
This was displeasing to Jehovah .
When Samuel finally arrived , the king excused his own disobedience , saying that because Samuel was late , he ‘ compelled himself ’ to offer up the burnt sacrifice to soften Jehovah’s face .
Yet , contrary to the clear instructions they had received , Saul and his people kept alive King Agag and “ the best of the flock and the herd and the fat ones and . . . the rams and . . . all that was good . ”
11 , 12 . ( a ) How does Jehovah view our efforts to please him in our worship ?
In private , how might our obedience to Jehovah be tested ?
Yes , while we are in our house , our integrity might be tested .
Yes , will we refuse even to look at immoral images ?
What of TV programs with violent content ?
Obedience That Stems From Love
Any such tangible benefits can rightly be viewed as blessings that prove the practicality of God’s laws .
Still , the main reason we obey Jehovah is that we love him .
God gave us the freedom to choose to obey whomever we want .
Jesus set the perfect example in obeying Jehovah out of heartfelt love for Him .
Jesus “ humbled himself and became obedient as far as death , yes , death on a torture stake . ”
We can be sure that Jesus is well - qualified in every way to serve as High Priest for his spiritual brothers as well as for others of believing mankind . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 15 ; 1 John 2 : 1 , 2 .
We can imitate Jesus in giving priority to obedience to God’s will .
Our loving God is fully aware of our efforts to be obedient in such areas .

How can we avoid showing it ?
Is it reasonable to hope that one day all the families of mankind will live together peacefully ?
Thus , some get enjoyment from oppressing others .
The Bible further states : “ Look ! the tears of those being oppressed , but they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 4 : 1 .
What Is the Root Cause ?
While it is true that some individuals have heroically opposed oppression , religion as a whole has all too frequently sided with the oppressors .
It was also true in South Africa under apartheid , when a minority protected their dominant position by laws that included a ban on interracial marriage .
However , the Bible reveals a deeper reason for ethnic intolerance .
It says : “ He that does not love has not come to know God , because God is love .
If anyone makes the statement : ‘ I love God , ’ and yet is hating his brother , he is a liar . For he who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot be loving God , whom he has not seen . ”
What knowledge does God’s Word reveal that restrains people from harming those who seem to be different ?
All ethnic groups can be proud to have received life from God , but all have something to regret about their ancestry .
Bible writer Paul noted : “ Through one man sin entered into the world . ”
Thus , “ all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ”
The widespread feeling that one’s own ethnic group is better than that of others runs counter to the facts set out in the Scriptures .
During the time Israel accepted this arrangement , other peoples could see the results of government by God in contrast with the results of government by men elsewhere .
Jehovah also taught Israel back then about the need for a sacrifice to restore mankind to a good relationship with God .
The Hebrew Scriptures given to the Jews contain a heartwarming description of the time when all ethnic groups would receive great blessings : “ Many nations will certainly go and say : ‘ Come , you people , and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will instruct us about his ways ’ . . .
Although Jesus Christ himself preached to the Jews , he also said : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ”
Notice how the Law asked for more than mere tolerance of non - Israelites residing in the land , when it said : “ The alien resident who resides as an alien with you should become to you like a native of yours ; and you must love him as yourself , for you became alien residents in the land of Egypt . ”
The Samaritans were an ethnic group that many Jews despised , so the woman was surprised .
The Samaritan could easily have reasoned : ‘ Why should I help a Jew ?
Paul wrote : “ Strip off the old personality with its practices , and clothe yourselves with the new personality , which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it , where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , foreigner , Scythian . . .
God’s Word foretells a time when “ the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah . ”

What can we learn from the parable of the neighborly Samaritan ?
THAT was the subject of a series of three - day district conventions , organized by Jehovah’s Witnesses , that began in May 2006 .
Arranging for adequate accommodations for the delegates was a big job .
Delegations came to that convention from Armenia , Belarus , Estonia , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Latvia , Lithuania , Moldova , Russia , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Ukraine , the United States , and Uzbekistan .
Thousands volunteered for preconvention work , making the stadiums and their surroundings fit locations for worship .
Invitations
The man accepted the invitation and attended the convention .
The program discussed how to handle a variety of problems .
Straightforward Scriptural counsel explained how these problems can be solved or endured .
Each day , members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses delivered talks , and reports from other lands added special interest .
These talks and reports were interpreted for the benefit of the different language groups present .
The guests came from a number of cultural backgrounds , but they were all united by the same faith . ”
This convention was unforgettable ! ”
Conventions .
And eight - year - old Annika from Finland wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Poland : “ The convention was even more wonderful than I could have imagined .
She was amazed at how strangers could instantly become such good friends . ”
A brother who worked at the News Service Department at the Prague convention relates : “ On Sunday morning , the officer in charge of the policemen assigned to the convention visited us .
Jehovah’s Witnesses have already been delivered from many of the plagues that afflict this world .
Six other convention sites throughout Poland and one in Slovakia were tied in electronically for the international parts of the program .
In Dortmund talks were presented in Arabic , Farsi , Portuguese , Spanish , and Russian ; at Frankfurt in English , French , and Serbian / ​ Croatian ; at Hamburg in Danish , Dutch , Swedish , and Tamil ; at Leipzig in Chinese , Polish , and Turkish ; and at Munich in Greek , Italian , and German Sign Language .
And in Poznan , they were Polish and Finnish .
Truly , the conventioners were divided by language , but they were united by their love .
Jehovah does not leave those captives without a messenger .
The first part of Ezekiel’s message centers on the fall and destruction of Jerusalem .
While ‘ Jehovah will bring upon the head of the wicked their own way , ’ he promises to regather the scattered ones of Israel . ​ — Ezekiel 11 : 17 - 21 .
Idolaters are rejected .
Ezekiel was grateful to serve Jehovah as a prophet .
Lying on the right side was for Judah’s 40 years of sin , spanning the period from Jeremiah’s appointment as a prophet in 647 B.C.E . to 607 B.C.E .
17 : 1 - 24 ​ — Who are the two great eagles , how are the young shoots of a cedar plucked off , and who is the “ tender one ” transplanted by Jehovah ?
The two eagles represent the rulers of Babylon and Egypt .
4 : 1 – 5 : 4 .
When Jehovah executes his judgment upon this system of things , money will have no value whatsoever .
8 : 5 - 18 .
Apostasy is spiritually deadly .
Even to those scoffing at his message , Ezekiel was to say : “ There will be no postponement anymore as to any words of [ Jehovah ] . ”
No one can do it for us . ​ — Romans 14 : 12 .
We are responsible for the consequences of our own actions .
Put on high even what is low , and bring low even the high one .
The guilt of Oholah ( Israel ) and of Oholibah ( Judah ) is exposed .
When the city finally falls , the Jews will be too stunned to express their grief .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
So great is her uncleanness that even standing the pot empty upon its coals and making it very hot fails to remove the rust .
21 : 18 - 22 .
22 : 6 - 16 .
A Message That Is Alive and Exerts Power
The prophecy regarding the destruction of Jerusalem clearly portrays Jehovah as a God who ‘ causes his people to know new things before they begin to spring up . ’ ​ — Isaiah 42 : 9 .
What is pictured by the celestial chariot ?
WHEN a child is shoved by a sibling , usually the child’s first reaction is to shove back .
Whom in particular should we not repay with evil ?
Their hearts should be filled with such deeply felt gratitude that they would be moved to do what Paul states next : “ Present your bodies a sacrifice living , holy , acceptable to God , a sacred service with your power of reason . ”
How , though , could those Christians actually present themselves “ a sacrifice ” to God ?
Consequently , a heart filled with gratitude moves us to serve God with all our strength , means , and abilities .
And having the mind of Christ affects how we treat others ​ — both fellow believers and nonbelievers .
Note how the apostle Paul next considers the motive of love .
In the book of Romans , Paul uses the word “ love ” ( a·gaʹpe in Greek ) several times when referring to God’s love and that of Christ .
“ Abhor ” can be translated “ hate exceedingly . ”
The word “ cling ” is a translation of a Greek verb that literally means “ to glue . ”
“ Return evil for evil to no one . ”
“ Do not avenge yourselves , beloved . ”
Hence , one way in which we bless persecutors is by praying for them , petitioning God that if any are opposing us because of ignorance , Jehovah may open their eyes to the truth .
( b ) As illustrated by Paul’s life , what change may occur in some persecutors ?
Not long after Pentecost 33 C.E . , Stephen was arrested by opposers of the Christian congregation , dragged outside Jerusalem , and stoned .
Before he died , he cried out : “ Jehovah , do not charge this sin against them . ”
Later , the resurrected Jesus appeared to Saul .
“ Be Peaceable With All Men ”
How are the words of admonition found at Romans 12 : 9 , 17 related ?
Paul’s next admonition on how to treat believers and unbelievers is : “ Return evil for evil to no one . ”
Doing so would be the opposite of having love “ without hypocrisy . ”
How do we apply those words ?
Paul tells his Christian brothers : “ If possible , as far as it depends upon you , be peaceable with all men . ”
In contrast , true Christians trust that Jehovah will “ cause justice to be done for his chosen ones . ”
16 , 17 . ( a ) What does it mean to “ heap fiery coals ” upon someone’s head ?
Taking vengeance on an enemy would likely harden his spirit , but treating him with kindness may soften his heart .
What does this mean ?
Similarly , by doing kind deeds to an opposer , we may “ melt ” his hardness and bring out his better qualities .
What evil forces are we facing today ?
The answers to these and related questions will be considered in the following article .
• What will motivate us not to retaliate ?
[ Box on page 22 ]
[ Picture on page 25 ]
Why do we say so ?
What enabled him to succeed ?
To answer those questions , let us consider some events in the life of Nehemiah .
*
In what environment did Nehemiah live , and what feat did he accomplish ?
Nehemiah served at the court of King Artaxerxes of Persia .
Although Nehemiah lived among unbelievers , he did not become “ fashioned after ” the “ system of things ” of those days .
That was an amazing feat , for during the construction work , the Israelites faced various forms of opposition .
“ Angry and Highly Offended ”
They replied : “ We must build . ”
In what ways did Nehemiah react to the accusations of his opposers ?
In fact , “ the entire wall came to be joined together clear to half its height , and the people continued to have a heart for working . ”
( a ) How might we imitate Nehemiah when opposers falsely accuse us ?
Hence , like Nehemiah , we refrain from retaliating with cutting words .
What were they to do ?
True , humanly speaking , the small band of Jews did not stand a chance against the overwhelming enemy forces , but Nehemiah urged them : “ Do not be afraid . . .
Why ?
Above all , Nehemiah reassured the people : “ Our God himself will fight for us . ”
Encouraged and prepared to deal with aggression , the builders kept working .
Of course , they refrain from using physical weapons .
After Nehemiah’s enemies realized that their open assaults had failed , they turned to more subtle forms of opposition .
So the enemies proposed that Nehemiah meet them halfway to resolve the differences .
How did Nehemiah react to his false accusers ?
Moreover , Nehemiah turned to Jehovah for support , praying : “ Strengthen my hands . ”
I shall not enter ! ”
Why did Nehemiah not fall into the trap that had been set for him ?
After all , a true prophet would never advise him to break God’s Law .
Again , Nehemiah did not let himself be conquered by evil opposers .
Shortly thereafter he could report : “ At length the wall came to completion on the twenty - fifth day of Elul , in fifty - two days . ” ​ — Nehemiah 6 : 10 - 15 ; Numbers 1 : 51 ; 18 : 7 .
They may try to convince us that if we serve Jehovah with a little less zeal , we could pursue worldly goals at the same time .
However , because God’s Kingdom comes first in our lives , we refuse to compromise .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What do Satan and his agents endeavor to achieve ?
God’s Word states regarding Christ’s anointed brothers : “ They conquered [ Satan ] because . . . of the word of their witnessing . ”
No wonder that Satan relentlessly attacks both the anointed remnant and the “ great crowd ” by stirring up opposition ! ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 ; 12 : 17 .
However , he will fail miserably because in imitation of Nehemiah of old , God’s people are determined to “ keep conquering the evil with the good . ”
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 29 ]
“ Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , ” said Jesus Christ , “ but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven . ”
We are warned : “ If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth , there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left , but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment . ”
However , if we are deeply grieved over a sin we have committed , it is very likely that we are truly repentant .
( b ) What is so comforting about Psalm 103 : 10 - 14 ?
For as the heavens are higher than the earth , his loving - kindness is superior toward those fearing him .
Comforting , too , are the apostle John’s words : “ By this we shall know that we originate with the truth , and we shall assure our hearts before him as regards whatever our hearts may condemn us in , because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things .
Beloved ones , if our hearts do not condemn us , we have freeness of speech toward God ; and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we are observing his commandments and are doing the things that are pleasing in his eyes . ” ​ — 1 John 3 : 19 - 22 .
Our heart will “ not condemn us ” if we trust in Jehovah , display brotherly love , and are not guilty of practicing deliberate sin .
They Sinned Against the Spirit
We will see that it is not so much a matter of what kind of sin a person has committed ; rather , it is the motive , the heart condition , and the degree of willfulness involved that determines whether a sin is forgivable or not .
How did some first - century Jewish religious leaders sin against the holy spirit ?
They saw God’s spirit at work in Jesus as he performed miracles that honored Jehovah .
According to Jesus , those who thus blasphemed against God’s holy spirit were thereby committing a sin that would not be forgiven in the present “ system of things nor in that to come . ” ​ — Matthew 12 : 22 - 32 .
Jesus ’ words about such sin show that Jesus is referring to those who willfully oppose the operation of God’s holy spirit .
He pursued a dishonest course , stealing from the money box entrusted to his care .
Jesus therefore called him “ the son of destruction . ” ​ — John 17 : 12 ; Matthew 26 : 14 - 16 .
How did King David sin in connection with Bath - sheba , and what comfort may be drawn from the way God dealt with them ?
How is the extent of God’s forgiveness illustrated in King Manasseh’s case ?
Eventually , the king of Assyria took Manasseh captive .
Centuries later , the apostle Peter sinned grievously by denying Jesus .
Allaying Fear About Sin
What if we have sinned but are unable to pray because our sin has made us spiritually sick ?
And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well , and Jehovah will raise him up .
Since Jehovah has no pleasure in the death of the wicked , he surely takes no delight in the loss of any of his servants .
We need to keep on attending congregation meetings and sharing in the Kingdom - preaching work .
Doing so will help us to be “ healthy in faith ” and free from anxiety over the possibility of having committed the unforgivable sin . ​ — Titus 2 : 2 .
They are repentant , and they have abiding faith in Jehovah’s forgiveness .
• How can anxiety about having committed an unforgivable sin be overcome ?
Although he denied Jesus , Peter did not commit an unforgivable sin
As we “ keep walking by spirit , ” God’s active force will motivate us to obey Jehovah .
4 , 5 .
Certain professed Christians of the first century C.E . denied that Jesus came in the flesh .
What is love , and what are some of its characteristics ?
Love does not become provoked or keep account of the injury .
Love bears , believes , hopes , and endures all things .
Moreover , it never fails . ​ — 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 - 8 .
Why should we show love for fellow worshippers of Jehovah ?
“ He who does not love remains in death , ” wrote the apostle John . “ Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer , and you know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him . ”
“ The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold ”
What is joy , and what are some reasons to be joyful ?
Peace ​ — another aspect of the spirit’s fruitage — ​ is a state of tranquillity and freedom from disturbance .
Especially did they have peace when they received the promised holy spirit .
Under the spirit’s influence and in answer to our prayers today , we enjoy the incomparable “ peace of God , ” which puts our heart and mind at rest .
The quality of long - suffering helps us to endure when others say or do unkind or thoughtless things .
Paul urged fellow Christians : “ Be long - suffering toward all . ”
Display Kindness and Goodness
Kindness is displayed when we show interest in others by means of friendly and helpful words and acts .
Kindness is expected of servants of God and Christ .
Kindness can be shown even if we have justifiably become angry because of someone’s hurtful words or inconsiderate actions .
It is especially fitting to display kindness toward those experiencing trials .
Our ability to do good is hindered because of inherited sin .
If we have faith , we are certain that everything Jehovah promises is as good as done .
That is the kind of faith we will display if we keep walking by spirit .
And our own “ faith without hypocrisy ” may well bolster the faith of others . ​ — 1 Timothy 1 : 5 ; Hebrews 13 : 7 .
We can exhibit mildness if we consistently walk by spirit and exercise self - control .
And the apostle Peter counseled fellow Christians to ‘ supply to their knowledge self - control . ’ ​ — 1 Peter 2 : 21 - 23 ; 2 Peter 1 : 5 - 8 .
We will be pleasant associates , and especially will people of godly devotion delight in our company .
If we trust in Jehovah with all our heart , we will enjoy life now and will be able to keep on walking forever in the righteous ways of the loving Provider of holy spirit . ​ — Psalm 128 : 1 ; Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 .
[ Picture on page 24 ]
Show kindness through helpful words and deeds
Meanwhile , we face hatred , reproach , persecution , and death for our faith .
We also experience illness , bereavement , and other trials .
Consider some real - life experiences that prove that we can wait for Jehovah’s day with endurance and undiminished faith .
“ For as long as I can recall , ” said Sharon , “ the wheelchair has been my constant companion .
Some 15 years ago , she said : “ My health may continue to fail , but my trust in God and my relationship with him are my lifelines .
Such factors as grave disappointment can cause depression .
However , he was able to pursue a godly life , and in time the intensity and frequency of such dreams diminished .
Imagine how hard it is for them to comment at Christian meetings or to give a talk in the Theocratic Ministry School !
Yet , they are enduring , and we greatly appreciate their presence and participation .
Enduring Bereavement
( b ) How can Anna’s example help us to endure bereavement ?
However , Christians know that there will be a resurrection .
Perhaps an illustration will be helpful .
Regular participation in Christian activities , including the Kingdom - preaching work , can help us to endure the effects of bereavement .
Some Christians have endured what trial related to family life ?
Because of the shock and grief , the betrayed marriage partner may be unable to sleep and may weep uncontrollably .
Solomon prayed to God : “ Whatever prayer , whatever request for favor there may occur on the part of any man or of all your people Israel , because they know each one the plague of his own heart , and they actually spread out their palms to this house , then may you yourself hear from the heavens , your established place of dwelling , and you must forgive and act and give to each one according to all his ways , because you know his heart ( for you yourself alone well know the heart of all the sons of mankind ) ; to the end that they may fear you all the days that they are alive upon the surface of the ground that you gave to our forefathers . ” ​ — 1 Kings 8 : 38 - 40 .
What scriptures can help to allay our anxiety ?
A certain amount of anxiety is to be expected when we must endure great stress .
Illness must have caused anxiety for such Christians as Timothy and Trophimus .
But the “ Hearer of prayer ” is always there for those who love him . ​ — Psalm 65 : 2 .
As we await Jehovah’s day , we have support and comfort from “ the God of peace . ”
With the eye of understanding , faith , and gratitude , we can reflect on God’s dealings with us and can “ see ” him as never before .
His countenance was tranquil ​ — like that of an angel , a messenger of God .
Consider the sentiments of certain Christians who suffered death at Nazi hands during World War II .
Relating his experience in court , one said : “ The death sentence was decreed . I listened , and then after I had spoken the words , ‘ Be thou faithful unto death , ’ and a few other words of our Lord , it was all over . . . .
A young Christian facing death by beheading wrote his parents : “ It is already past midnight .
Ah !
22 , 23 .
Yet , God - fearing Job was right when he said : “ Man , born of woman , is short - lived and glutted with agitation . ”
How Would You Respond ?
• Why do Christians need endurance ?
The Babylonian king has begun his final siege of Jerusalem .
So far , Ezekiel’s message to the exiles in Babylon has centered on one theme : the fall and destruction of their beloved city , Jerusalem .
Now , though , the subject of Ezekiel’s prophecies shifts to the doom of the pagan nations that would rejoice at the calamity upon God’s people .
Ezekiel 25 : 1 – 48 : 35 contains prophecies about the nations surrounding Israel and the deliverance of God’s people .
* Except for Ezekiel 29 : 17 - 20 , the account follows chronological as well as topical order .
However , these four verses are in place topically .
‘ Pharaoh the king of Egypt and his crowd ’ are likened to a cedar that will be cut down by the “ sword of the king of Babylon . ” ​ — Ezekiel 31 : 2 , 3 , 12 ; 32 : 11 , 12 .
After the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E . , the remnant of Judah fled to Egypt despite the prophet Jeremiah’s warning .
29 : 18 ​ — How was ‘ every head made bald and every shoulder rubbed bare ’ ?
Neither the conduct of secular authorities nor the way the taxes are put to use cancels this obligation . ​ — Romans 13 : 4 - 7 .
Our salvation depends on our turning away from bad ways and complying with what God requires .
Indeed , Jehovah’s way is “ adjusted right . ”
36 : 20 , 21 .
The spiritual paradise that we enjoy today is filled with “ a flock of holy persons . ”
“ SET YOUR HEART UPON ALL THAT I AM SHOWING YOU ”
( Ezekiel 40 : 1 – 48 : 35 )
He is told : “ Son of man , see with your eyes , and with your ears hear , and set your heart upon all that I am showing you . ”
Ezekiel also receives a vision of tribal assignments of land ​ — each allotment running east to west with an administrative strip between the allotments of Judah and Benjamin .
40 : 3 – 47 : 12 ​ — What is represented by the visionary temple ?
This temple of gigantic proportions seen by Ezekiel in vision was actually never built .
It pictured God’s spiritual temple ​ — his templelike arrangement for pure worship in our day .
Perhaps that is why “ the molten sea ” of Solomon’s temple ​ — a huge water basin used for the priests to wash in — ​ is lacking in the visionary temple . ​ — 1 Kings 7 : 23 - 26 .
44 : 10 - 16 ​ — Who is represented by the priestly class ?
Thereafter , they had to work hard to keep themselves “ without spot from the world , ” thus becoming examples to the “ great crowd , ” represented by the nonpriestly tribes . ​ — James 1 : 27 ; Revelation 7 : 9 , 10 .
The river progressively deepens to accommodate the influx of new ones who take up true worship .
47 : 12 ​ — What do the fruitful trees represent ?
The overseers among God’s people are to be approachable .
40 : 14 , 16 , 22 , 26 .
How grateful we can be for the services provided by the modern - day priestly class !
On the other hand , those who do not accept the life - giving water will be ‘ given to salt ’ ​ — destroyed permanently .
But those who sanctify that name in their lives by worshipping Jehovah in an acceptable way will receive everlasting life .

“ First of all , I want to tell you that I love you with all my heart . . . .
Jehovah knows that better than you do , and he will provide everything you need and will reward you for all that you have endured .
“ Guard Against Every Sort of Covetousness ”
“ Even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses . ” ​ — LUKE 12 : 15 .
( b ) How may we be affected by such attitudes ?
What can help us to resist the world’s efforts to ‘ squeeze us into its own mould ’ ? ​ — Romans 12 : 2 , The New Testament in Modern English , by J .
He sounded a strong warning against covetousness and reinforced that warning with a thought - provoking illustration .
Prior to the man’s interruption , Jesus was speaking to his disciples and others about being on guard against hypocrisy , about having the courage to confess union with the Son of man , and about receiving help from the holy spirit .
It has been said that “ the character of a man is often indicated by the direction which his thoughts take when he is listening to a religious exhortation . ”
While Jesus was speaking about serious spiritual matters , the man was probably thinking about what he could do to achieve certain financial advantages .
In any case , his question suggested that deep down , there was a problem ​ — a serious lack of appreciation for spiritual matters .
Is this not good reason for us to examine ourselves ?
Instead , we should pay attention to what is said and think of ways to make personal application of the information so that we can improve our relationship with our heavenly Father , Jehovah God , and with our fellow Christians . ​ — Psalm 22 : 22 ; Mark 4 : 24 .
In saying that , Jesus was referring to something that the people were well - aware of , for according to the Mosaic Law , judges in the cities were appointed to rule on just such matters .
Following Jesus ’ example , rather than being sidetracked by mundane issues , we use our time and energy to preach the good news and to “ make disciples of people of all the nations . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 ; 28 : 19 .
What is covetousness , and what can it lead to ?
Satan was the first to covet something that belonged to someone else ​ — the glory , honor , and authority that are Jehovah’s alone .
How should we ‘ keep our eyes open , ’ as Jesus admonished ?
The disciple James explains that wrong desire , “ when it has become fertile , gives birth to sin . ”
11 , 12 . ( a ) What warning did Jesus give against covetousness ?
In this regard , we all know that to live , or to sustain the life we have , does not really require very much .
This thought becomes evident when we examine what life Jesus was speaking about .
What can we learn from the word for “ life ” found in the Bible account ?
Thus , they labor incessantly to amass wealth and possessions , mistakenly equating such things with security and happiness . ​ — Psalm 49 : 6 , 11 , 12 .
It may be true that a higher living standard ​ — having an abundance of food , clothing , shelter , and other amenities — ​ could contribute to a more comfortable life or may even allow for better medical care and thus add a few years to a person’s life span .
The apostle Paul pointed to the danger of putting too much stock in such things .
( b ) What parable of Jesus will be considered in the following article ?
What Is Your Answer ?
• Why does life not result from material possessions ?

( b ) What challenge and danger must Christians face ?
It is easy to become so concerned with food , clothing , and shelter that the more important things are neglected or even forgotten .
It is found at Luke 12 : 16 - 21 .
Just as he thinks he is ready to relax and enjoy a good life , God tells him that his life is coming to an end and all the good things the man has stored up will go to someone else .
What lesson can we learn from this parable ?
In fact , from what Jesus said , it is reasonable to think that the man portrayed in the parable had worked hard .
Likewise , many Witness youths do well in school .
Why “ Unreasonable ” ?
He thought that because of having “ many good things , ” he would also have “ many years . ”
But too bad for him , things did not work out that way .
Why is the possession of “ many good things ” no guarantee of having “ many years ” ?
Therefore , Jesus added this final admonition to the parable : “ So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 21 .
To Be Rich Toward God
Doing so will surely make us rich toward God .
When Jehovah bestows blessings on his people , he always gives them the best .
This is often reflected in their way of life .
They want to impress people with what the Bible calls “ the showy display of one’s means of life . ”
What must we do in order to be rich toward God ?
In Jesus ’ illustration , the man planned and worked hard only to enrich himself , and he was called unreasonable .
He had a well - paying job as a computer technician .
“ Actually , I was better off financially than when I worked with computers , ” he said .
The change enabled this Christian to enter the full - time ministry , and he is now serving at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in his country .
For the past 20 years , she has happily served in the full - time ministry .
Like Paul , how can we be rich toward God ?
Yet , he later wrote : “ I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . ”
Likewise , by relinquishing any selfish ambitions and pursuing a life of godly devotion , we too can enjoy a life that is rich in God’s eyes .

( b ) What does the Bible say about Jehovah and his quality of justice ?
JUSTICE is defined as ‘ the quality of being impartial , fair , acting in conformity with what is morally upright and good . ’
Nearly 3,500 years ago , Moses wrote regarding the Universal Sovereign , Jehovah : “ All his ways are justice .
Never may that become so ! ”
Their wrong actions would result in enormous suffering and death for the entire human family . ​ — Genesis 3 : 1 - 6 ; Romans 5 : 12 ; Hebrews 2 : 14 .
He has always perpetrated gross injustices .
That situation still prevailed in the time of Jesus .
The Bible foretold that during this period in history , people would be “ lovers of themselves , lovers of money , self - assuming , haughty , blasphemers , . . . unthankful , disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , without love of goodness , betrayers , headstrong , puffed up with pride . ”
Bad traits like those lead to injustices of all kinds .
6 , 7 .
The past hundred years have seen injustices on a scale never before experienced .
For example , some historians estimate that in World War II alone , the dead totaled from some 50 million to 60 million , the majority of whom were civilians ​ — innocent men , women , and children .
Global military spending is now about a trillion dollars each year .
Then , too , consider the many innocents who are killed by abortions .
We read : “ I became envious of the boasters , when I would see the very peace of wicked people .
What did the psalmist Asaph come to understand ?
Wickedness and injustice will be replaced by righteousness and justice , for then the prayer will be answered in the fullest sense : “ Let your kingdom come .
The Bible tells us what kind of rulership we can expect , rulership that all righthearted individuals now long for .
The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this . ”
In God’s new world , we will no longer have reason to express the words we find at Ecclesiastes 4 : 1 : “ I myself returned that I might see all the acts of oppression that are being done under the sun , and , look ! the tears of those being oppressed , but they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power , so that they had no comforter . ”
Yes , Jehovah will correct everything that is wrong , doing so in a way that is far beyond our expectations .
How appropriate that Jehovah God inspired the apostle Peter to write : “ There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise , and in these righteousness is to dwell ” ! ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
Indeed , the “ new heavens , ” God’s heavenly government in the hands of Christ , has been set in place already .
Their unity is the most pronounced and enduring in the history of the world , a unity exceeding anything experienced by Satan’s subjects .
( a ) How will God react to Satan’s coming attack on His people ?
The attack by Satan and his horde on Jehovah’s servants will be the final insult .
He will respond immediately and eliminate the perpetrators .
The great “ lover of justice ” will not tolerate it .

Is the “ Old Testament ” Still Relevant ?
IN 1786 a French physician published a book called Traité d’anatomie et de physiologie ( A Discussion of Anatomy and Physiology ) .
It is considered the most accurate neuroanatomical work of its time , and a rare copy recently sold for over 27 thousand dollars !
The historical and literary value of such a book hardly makes it helpful to a sick person now .
Many feel the same way about the so - called Old Testament .
They appreciate its account of Israel’s history and admire its beautiful poetry .
Some of these ideas persist .
How can we reconcile “ Jehovah of armies ” in the Old Testament with “ the God of love and of peace ” in the New Testament ?
Publishers may insert a small paragraph that supplies the name of the writer’s hometown , his academic credentials , and a list of his published works .
The answer is that different aspects of God’s personality are revealed in different parts of the Bible .
In the book of Genesis alone , he is described as feeling “ hurt at his heart , ” as the “ Producer of heaven and earth , ” and as “ the Judge of all the earth . ”
But he remains the same God .
It is not uncommon today for textbooks to be replaced when new research becomes available or when popular opinion changes .
Why would Jesus still be using the Hebrew Scriptures at the end of his earthly ministry if they were out - of - date ?
After the Christian congregation was established , Jesus ’ followers continued to use the Hebrew Scriptures to highlight prophecies that were yet to be fulfilled , principles from the Mosaic Law that taught valuable lessons , and accounts of ancient servants of God whose fine examples encourage Christians to remain faithful .
“ All Scripture , ” wrote the apostle Paul , “ is inspired of God and beneficial . ”
Consider the present - day problem of racial prejudice .
Maybe in a group they won’t attack us . ”
In addition , the pursuit of wealth at all costs ​ — so common in today’s materialistic world — ​ was accurately described by one of the richest men in history , King Solomon .
Through the Hebrew Scriptures , we learn details about life under God’s Kingdom that give us comfort and draw us closer to the Source of that comfort , Jehovah God .
He will feel sorry for the lowly one and the poor one , and the souls of the poor ones he will save . ”
Yes , the Hebrew Scriptures are still an integral part of God’s inspired Word , the Bible .

At 2 Corinthians 3 : 14 , the apostle Paul was referring to the Mosaic Law , which is only a part of the pre - Christian Scriptures .

What Bible principles can help a person make right decisions ?
About eight years later , King Nebuchadnezzar has a mysterious dream .
The true God rescues the three , and Nebuchadnezzar is forced to recognize that “ there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one . ” ​ — Daniel 3 : 29 .
Many decades later , King Belshazzar holds a big feast for his grandees and disrespectfully uses vessels that were taken from Jehovah’s temple .
In the days of Darius , when Daniel is more than 90 years old , the aged prophet becomes the target of a murderous scheme by jealous officials .
The account states that this was “ in the second year of the kingship of Nebuchadnezzar . ”
The Medo - Persian Empire , represented by the silver part of the image , was inferior to Babylon , the head of gold , in that it did not have the distinction of toppling Judah .
Greece was inferior still , even as copper is inferior to silver .
4 : 10 , 11 , 20 - 22 ​ — What was represented , or symbolized , by the immense tree in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream ?
6 : 6 - 10 ​ — Since praying to Jehovah does not require any particular posture , would it not have been prudent on Daniel’s part to pray in secret for the period of 30 days ?
Any change in Daniel’s routine with regard to prayer might have seemed to others to be a compromise and could have indicated a failure in his rendering exclusive devotion to Jehovah .
When dealing with difficult situations , we should act with similar insight , understanding , and wisdom .
2 : 29 , 30 .
We too should strive to be “ faithful in all things . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 3 : 11 .
Proclaiming the Kingdom message , which includes God’s adverse judgments , requires the same kind of faith and courage that Daniel displayed in making known what was to befall Nebuchadnezzar and what the king should do so that ‘ his prosperity might be lengthened . ’
( Daniel 7 : 1 – 12 : 13 )
The year is now 539 B.C.E .
Time moves on to 536 / 535 B.C.E .
The conflict between the two kings stretches from the time when the kingdom of Alexander the Great is divided among his four generals to the time when the Great Prince , Michael , “ will stand up . ” ​ — Daniel 12 : 1 .
The title “ Prince of princes ” applies only to Jehovah God ​ — the Chief of all angelic princes , including “ Michael , one of the foremost princes . ” ​ — Daniel 10 : 13 .
But by keeping the Abrahamic covenant in force toward fleshly Israel until 36 C.E . , Jehovah extended the period of special favor to the Jews on the basis of their being descendants of Abraham .
Because of his humility , godly devotion , studiousness , and persistence in prayer , Daniel was “ someone very desirable . ”
These very traits also helped him to remain faithful to God to the end of his life .
In imitation of the angel who came to Daniel , we should encourage and strengthen one another with helping hands and consoling words .
Consider the prophecies contained therein ​ — those already fulfilled and those yet to be fulfilled .
The true God sent his angel and rescued Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego out of the fiery furnace .
Jehovah ‘ helps and shields those trusting in him ’ and ‘ blesses those fearing him . ’ ​ — Psalm 115 : 9 , 13 .
“ Let all your affairs take place with love . ” ​ — 1 CORINTHIANS 16 : 14 .
MOST would agree that the birth of a child can be one of life’s most joyful events .
“ I thought she was the most beautiful child I had ever seen . ”
However , Christian parents who desire to give such loving training face challenges .
What challenges do parents face ?
We are now living deep in the last days of this system .
Even among family members , people display “ no natural affection ” and have become “ unthankful , disloyal , . . . without self - control , fierce . ”
Daily contact with people who display such traits can affect the way members of Christian families treat one another .
How can parents raise happy children ?
Why do parents need to be long - suffering ?
Even if a parent replies with a firm no , the child may ask again and again , hoping for a different answer .
Parents , can you remember bothering your mother or father to give in to a childish request ?
If so , you likely appreciate why your children behave as they do and why they need constant , patient reminders of your decisions .
It is worth noting that Jehovah told Israelite parents to “ inculcate ” his laws in their young ones .
This implies that parents may have to repeat themselves many times before a child learns to apply God’s laws .
Rather , Jehovah , as the ultimate Head of the family , confers on parents the authority to train and discipline their children lovingly .
In fact , discipline is closely linked with the next aspect of love mentioned by Paul .
“ Whom Jehovah loves he disciplines , ” wrote Paul .
For example , from infancy , children of Christian parents are taught fundamental Bible principles as well as the need to participate in the various aspects of true worship .
However , Lot replied : “ Not that , please , Jehovah ! ”
Did Jehovah abdicate his authority ?
Nevertheless , he considered Lot’s request and chose to extend extra kindness to him in this matter .
Parents are not being kind if they constantly warn their children about a deserved punishment but fail to carry it out .
But children feel more secure and develop more respect and love for their parents when they know that their parents ’ “ Yes ” means yes and their “ No ” means no ​ — even if that entails punishment . ​ — Matthew 5 : 37 .
In addition , when meting out punishment , Jehovah is neither unduly stern nor overly permissive .
A fundamental step is to encourage their children to express their feelings honestly , even if what the children say is difficult for the parents to accept .
Understandably , parents rejoice when children express thoughts and feelings in harmony with righteous standards .
Of course , disrespectful speech should be promptly corrected , but there is a difference between teaching children how to communicate politely and dictating what they say .
How can parents encourage honest communication ?
We felt that if we always cut her off and arbitrarily imposed our will , she would become frustrated and would learn not to tell us what was really in her heart .
This helped them develop thinking ability . ” ​ — Proverbs 1 : 1 - 4 .
• How are kindness and discipline related ?

AN ARCHER prepares to shoot an arrow at a target .
An archer has the arrow in his bow for only a relatively short time .
After what seems to be just a few short years , the children grow up and leave home .
Will they hit the target ​ — that is , will the children continue to love and serve God after they leave home ?
Numerous factors influence the answer .
Let us examine each of these factors in more detail .
Skillful Parents Set a Good Example
What questions do parents do well to ask themselves , and why ?
Why is parental example so important ?
Does my example encourage my child to develop useful habits ?
They will likely learn that Jehovah supplies our physical needs ​ — for which he should be thanked — ​ and that he teaches us spiritual truths .
How can parents help children to feel that Jehovah is interested in them as individuals ?
Note the comments of one father who raised two children : “ At the end of each week , I asked myself two questions : ‘ What things were of concern to my children this week ?
For any relationship to grow and survive , the individuals involved must not only talk to each other but also listen .
Some may wonder , though , ‘ Why do children need a family study if their parents regularly take them to congregation meetings ? ’
* In almost every paragraph of this Bible study aid , children are asked to express their opinion on the subjects discussed .
Either child could assume the role of Father or Mother , but the children had to work together to research the subject and to give direction about school dances . ”
True , it requires perseverance and imagination to keep a family study regular and relevant , but the rewards are worth the effort . ​ — Proverbs 23 : 15 .
Despite his shortcomings , Paul could confidently write to the congregation in Corinth : “ Become imitators of me , even as I am of Christ . ”
How can you know ?
You are likely to hear your thoughts echoed in their comments .
Our boys have grown up rubbing shoulders with people who love Jehovah , and they now see that serving God is an enjoyable way of life . ”
A Child’s Responsibility
What did Jesus mean when he said that his faithful slave would be “ discreet ” ?
Jesus raised the question : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics , to give them their food at the proper time ? ”
Of the ten virgins , five did not have enough oil when the bridegroom arrived , and they missed out on the marriage feast .
However , there was more work for them to do on earth , and some were not prepared for that .
Hence , they proved to be “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
Jesus said : “ Everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man , who built his house upon the rock - mass . ”
Why was Joseph chosen ?
Similarly , the Bible says that Abigail was “ good in discretion . ”
[ Footnote ]
Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Under the rulership of Jeroboam II , there is material prosperity in Israel , but that wanes soon after his death .
The 59 - year - long prophetic career of Hosea , which began in 804 B.C.E . , stretches into this time of turmoil .
An exposé of Israel’s error and the prophetic judgments against her and the kingdom of Judah are the subjects of Hosea’s message .
“ TAKE TO YOURSELF A WIFE OF FORNICATION ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
1 : 1 ​ — Why does Hosea mention all four kings who ruled over Judah during his ministry while naming only one ruler of Israel ?
1 : 2 - 9 ; 3 : 1 , 2 .
1 : 6 - 9 .
Jehovah hates spiritual adultery , just as he hates physical adultery .
1 : 7 , 10 , 11 ; 2 : 14 - 23 .
Jehovah is willing to forgive those who manifest heartfelt repentance .
Why ?
Rather than looking to God for help , “ to Egypt they have called ; to Assyria they have gone . ” ​ — Hosea 7 : 11 .
The kingdom of Judah is not free of guilt .
Their loving - kindness was as brief and fleeting as “ the morning clouds and . . . the dew that early goes away . ”
To repent in words only is hypocritical and futile .
In order to receive God’s mercy , a wrongdoer must manifest heartfelt repentance , made evident by his return to something “ higher , ” that is , to an elevated form of worship .
Jehovah sent “ fire into [ Judah’s ] cities ” in 607 B.C.E . by the hand of the Babylonians , bringing foretold desolation to Jerusalem and the land of Judah .
We should worship God with a heart that is not hypocritical .
Jehovah always deals lovingly with his people .
In 537 B.C.E . , the Babylonian exile ended and a remnant returned to Jerusalem .
12 : 6 .
13 : 6 .
The Israelites “ became satisfied and their heart began to be exalted . That is why they forgot [ Jehovah ] . ”
We need to guard against any tendency toward self - exaltation .
Moreover , appreciating the benefits of mercy will move us to display this quality more fully in our lives .
Jehovah is “ the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort . ”
Mercy is shown by treating someone in a compassionate way .
What does Isaiah 49 : 15 teach us about mercy ?
As recorded at Isaiah 49 : 15 , Jehovah says : “ Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly ? ”
Hebrew words closely related to the one here translated “ pity ” are used in connection with mercy at Psalm 145 : 8 , 9 , quoted above .
Jehovah has such tender feelings for those to whom he shows mercy .
It is one thing to feel compassion but quite another to act on it for the benefit of the disadvantaged .
They were begging Jesus to restore their sight miraculously .
Does it also involve what might be viewed as a negative action , such as a holding back of punishment ?
Mercy Toward Transgressors
What did the mercy shown to David after his sin with Bath - sheba involve ?
Thoroughly wash me from my error , and cleanse me even from my sin .
However , he does not hold back from administering appropriate punishment .
How grateful we can be that Jehovah shows mercy when rendering judgment !
The Israelite judges were not authorized to do this .
To make possible the forgiveness of sin without the violation of justice , Jehovah has provided the ransom sacrifice of his Son , Jesus Christ ​ — the greatest expression of mercy ever shown .
To avail ourselves of God’s mercy , which can save us from receiving punishment for inherited sin , we must ‘ exercise faith in the Son . ’ ​ — John 3 : 16 , 36 .
Jehovah is “ a God merciful and gracious , . . . pardoning error and transgression and sin , but by no means will he give exemption from punishment . ”
Concerning him , the Bible states : “ The Rock , perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice . ”
For example , when the wicked in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah met their end , the patriarch Lot and his two daughters were saved . ​ — Genesis 19 : 12 - 26 .
Thus , they will “ come out of the great tribulation . ” ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 - 14 .
Why should we strive to be merciful ?
How vital that we strive to be merciful !
No doubt , one of the reasons why David was shown mercy for his sin with Bath - sheba was that he himself was a merciful man .
• What is mercy ?

Likewise , a Levite also , when he got down to the place and saw him , went by on the opposite side .
Next , Jesus asked his listener : “ Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man that fell among the robbers ? ”
Moved by a feeling of pity , or compassion , the Samaritan acted in a way that brought relief to the victim .
Moreover , the man in need was a stranger to the Samaritan .
3 , 4 .
Of greater importance than giving materially is giving spiritually to assist members of the expanding Christian congregation .
This was dispatched to the elders there “ by the hand of Barnabas and Saul . ”
“ If You Continue Showing Favoritism ”
Warning about a characteristic that works against mercy and “ the kingly law ” of love , James wrote : “ If you continue showing favoritism , you are working a sin , for you are reproved by the law as transgressors . ”
Showing such consideration is not favoritism .
Full of Mercy ”
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above , but is the earthly , animal , demonic .
Psalm 94 : 4 states : “ All the practicers of what is hurtful keep bragging about themselves . ”
Moreover , think of the harm that can be done by “ a false witness [ who ] launches forth mere lies . ”
After discussing the misuse of the tongue , James says : “ It is not proper , my brothers , for these things to go on occurring this way . ”
“ Forgive Men Their Trespasses ”
( b ) What does it mean to forgive our brother “ up to seventy - seven times ” ?
Having no means to pay the debt , the slave begged for mercy .
How forcefully the above - mentioned parable points out that mercy includes a readiness to forgive !
Should we not also “ forgive men their trespasses ” ?
Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Allow me to extract the straw from your eye ’ ; when , look !
We are exhorted to “ become imitators of God ” and to “ work what is good toward all . ”
What factors affect the way we show mercy to others ?
Having no way to deal with problems that confront them nor any real hope for the future , most people are “ skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ”
For a good deed to be an act of true mercy , it must be a gift that comes from inside ​ — from a loving and willing heart .
The more merciful we are , the more we become like God .
• Why is it especially important to be merciful to fellow believers ?
• How can we practice mercy within the Christian congregation ?
• How may we work what is good toward those outside the congregation ?
The Samaritan acted mercifully
If they do , Jehovah will “ show compassion upon his people ” and will put far away “ the northerner ” ​ — the insect assault .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
For example , just such a day came upon ancient Babylon in 539 B.C.E . when it was conquered by the Medes and the Persians .
2 : 1 - 10 , 28 ​ — How has the prophecy about the invasion by insects been fulfilled ?
There is no record in the Bible of an insect invasion of the land of Canaan of the magnitude described in the book of Joel .
Therefore , the assault Joel describes is apparently pictorial of the time in 33 C.E . when Jehovah started to pour out his spirit upon early followers of Christ and they began preaching the message that tormented false religious leaders .
2 : 32 ​ — What does it mean to ‘ call on the name of Jehovah ’ ?
2 : 12 , 13 .
How grateful we can be that Jehovah pours out his spirit on every sort of flesh and has young and old , male and female , share in the work of prophesying , that is , declaring “ the magnificent things of God ” !
Joel prophesied that the nations surrounding Judah would be called to account for mistreating God’s chosen people .
“ GET READY TO MEET YOUR GOD ”
What about the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel ?
Despite various punishments already meted out , the idolatrous Israelites remain obstinate .
Amos tells them : “ Get ready to meet your God . ”
Amos faces opposition from a priest of Bethel but remains undeterred .
Yet , there is a promise of restoration .
It likely refers to the tax levied by the king for the upkeep of his horsemen and animals .
It was with regard to his anger toward Israel , Judah , and the six nations surrounding them that Jehovah says : “ I shall not turn it back . ”
Jehovah’s judgments are inescapable . ​ — Amos 9 : 2 - 5 .
As long as Jehovah patiently allows this wicked system of things to continue , we should exhort those in it to turn to God .
We would be wise to “ keep awake ” spiritually and to remain in a state of readiness . ​ — Luke 21 : 36 .
9 : 7 - 10 .
The day for executing divine judgment upon Satan’s world is near .
As Jehovah’s day nears , it is the course of wisdom to draw close to God and keep ourselves separate from the wicked world and its corrupting associations .
Joel prophesied : “ The day of Jehovah is near ! ”
“ Every breathing thing ​ — let it praise Jah . ” ​ — PSALM 150 : 6 .
“ I STUDIED medicine because I wanted to use my life to help people .
I also felt that the prestige and financial rewards of being a doctor would make me happy , ” recalls Seung Jin , who grew up in Korea .
( b ) How do we know that the Creator had a purpose in putting us here ?
The fact that we are endowed with intelligence , conscience , and the ability to reason implies that the Creator had a good purpose in putting us here .
For example , the wonderful way in which we are made is truly an expression of unselfish love on God’s part .
( a ) What is needed to have real purpose in life ?
( b ) What is the highest purpose anyone can pursue ?
Like a child who needs to sense the presence of his parents to feel happy and secure , we need a good relationship with our heavenly Father to find real meaning and purpose in life .
Why is putting material interests first unrealistic ?
Regrettably , many people focus their life almost exclusively on the acquiring of material things .
Yet , trying to satisfy all our needs solely with material things is unrealistic .
They appear to make one happy , but they do not .
No , it is not .
Jesus explained : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
What Is “ the Real Life ” ?
Why is working to advance the interests of God’s Kingdom purposeful ?
Contrast life in the present system with “ the real life . ”
In contrast with the uncertain riches , the fleeting glory , and the shallow pleasures of the present system , “ the real life ” ​ — everlasting life under God’s Kingdom — ​ is permanent and worthy of our sacrifices , provided we make the right sacrifices .
How did one couple make the right sacrifices ?
She told Suzanne : “ Honey , if you ever want to live in a nicer place , you’ll just have to sacrifice something . ”
Henry and Suzanne , though , knew that putting Jehovah first “ holds promise of the life now and that which is to come . ”
There is real danger , however , if we lose sight of our true purpose and loosen our hold on “ the real life . ”
Paul advised “ those making use of the world [ to be ] as those not using it to the full . ”
“ I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses just as I was completing dental school , ” Keith relates .
I chose to limit my practice so as to have more time for the spiritual and emotional well - being of our family , which came to include five daughters .
Though we rarely had extra funds , we learned to economize , and we always had what we needed .
The Bible presents examples of those who lived for God’s purpose and those who did not .
The lessons from such examples apply to people of all ages , cultures , and circumstances .
For his part , Paul is known , not as a Law expert , but as a missionary , “ an apostle to the nations . ” ​ — Romans 11 : 13 .
I see that making Jehovah’s purpose our purpose is the only meaningful way of life . ”
How can we find true purpose in life ?
And we will have found true purpose in life .
• What is the highest purpose we can have in life ?
Recount an experience one missionary had in his assignment .
So having life and a measure of health , they want to use these assets in harmony with God’s purpose .
How can we do this ?
Taking Progressive , Practical Steps
Such advancement is not self - promotion but a reflection of our determination to do God’s will unselfishly .
Hesitation or too much self - concern , however , can be an impediment to our making progress in our service to God .
Will I like the brothers ?
I prayed for help and went ahead .
Illustrate .
For instance , Guoming and his two sisters live with their mother in an area where housing costs are high and steady employment can be hard to find .
“ Still , we can continue in the pioneer ministry and also take good care of our mother .
Koichi resumed his study of the Bible and accepted help from the congregation .
Why do we need to be balanced in doing God’s work ?
For instance , for two years Ji Hye , who lives in East Asia , worked at a high - pressure job while pioneering .
In order to serve Jehovah with her ‘ whole heart , soul , mind , and strength , ’ Ji Hye searched for less - demanding employment .
“ Despite pressure from my family to seek financial success , I endeavored to put God’s purpose first , ” she says .
I find joy in my ministry , and I am spiritually stronger now .
That is because I’m not so exposed to the attractions and distractions of the world . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 4 : 6 ; Matthew 6 : 24 , 28 - 30 .
None of us , for that matter , should underestimate the effect that our efforts , even if limited , can have on others .
In any case , by doing what we can in the public ministry , we are doing God’s work .
We are “ God’s fellow workers . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 3 : 9 .
Our good influence on others can be profound and long lasting .
When elders and ministerial servants carry out their duties diligently , they contribute to the spiritual health and stability of the congregation , and Christian activity increases .
We are assured that when we have “ plenty to do in the work of the Lord , ” our labor “ is not in vain . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 58 .
Married couples who are in the full - time ministry may qualify to receive Gilead missionary training and to serve in a foreign assignment .
And there is an ongoing need for volunteers to do a variety of tasks at Bethel and in building and maintaining meeting places and branch offices .
As a dedicated servant of Jehovah , always look to him and to his organization for direction .
People observe this and now show greater interest in our message . ”
What can you do if you desire to pursue the full - time ministry ?
Can you pursue God’s purpose by choosing the full - time ministry as your career ?
If your present circumstances do not permit it , perhaps an adjustment can be made .
As time passes , your experience will grow , and your joy will increase .
They will tell you that Jehovah has never failed to help them to obtain even in difficult circumstances what they really need and much more .
From 1955 to 1961 , The Watchtower published a series of life stories of faithful ones under the heading “ Pursuing My Purpose in Life . ”
Each account projects a spirit of zeal and joy that reminds us of that found in the Bible book of Acts .
Most never found one .
Not far in the future when the “ great tribulation ” strikes , material riches and worldly positions will be worthless .

Deliverance From the Traps of the Birdcatcher
He is referred to at Psalm 91 : 3 as “ the birdcatcher . ”
Who is this enemy ?
Hence , for our protection , we need to identify various schemes of “ the birdcatcher . ”
When do Satan’s tactics resemble those of a lion ?
Such lionlike attacks may cause a few to stumble .
Happily , we are not ignorant of Satan’s designs .
Fear of Man
Soon , though , he is doing something that is both harmful to his health and displeasing to God .
Perhaps he got involved with the wrong sort of peers and was afraid to incur their disapproval .
To avoid being caught alive , guard against even small compromises .
Heed the Bible’s warning to shun bad association . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 33 .
Conscientious Christian parents take seriously their Scriptural responsibility to provide materially for their families .
In what way does Satan use the lure of materialism ?
Does it not mirror the thinking of the “ unreasonable ” rich man of Jesus ’ parable ? ​ — Luke 12 : 16 - 21 .
However , many get ensnared by “ the birdcatcher ” because they do not apply that counsel to themselves .
Could it be that pride makes them feel that they must adhere to a certain lifestyle ?
The Trap of Unwholesome Entertainment
What self - examination should each Christian make ?
Recall , however , Jehovah’s words through the prophet Isaiah : “ Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good ! ”
* This observation was made about the subtle impact of popular soap operas : “ The search for love is used to justify any conduct .
I don’t care . . . .
What facts indicate the current appropriateness of the warning about certain TV programming ?
Can a Christian really justify choosing to be entertained by the sort of people he would never dream of inviting into his home ?
Many benefited when they took to heart that warning provided by “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
* One confessed : “ For 13 years I was a soap - opera addict .
During World War I , Satan tried to destroy the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization by frontal attack , but he failed .
What can help those who have personal differences to resolve them ?
Thus , we must be careful if we feel inclined not to forgive someone .
We could become like the slave in Jesus ’ parable who refused to forgive his fellow slave a debt that was but a fraction of the debt that his master had already forgiven him .
When the master was informed , he had the unforgiving slave thrown into prison .
How should we view Jehovah’s “ secret place ” and “ shadow ” during these dangerous times ?
To avoid being trapped by “ the birdcatcher , ” therefore , we must remain in the figurative place of protection , “ dwelling in the secret place of the Most High , ” procuring “ lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One . ” ​ — Psalm 91 : 1 .
May we always view Jehovah’s reminders and directions as protective , never as restrictive .
Together we face a predator who has superhuman intelligence .

Do You Recall ?
[ Picture on page 29 ]
Isaac in his old age told Esau to hunt some venison , saying : “ Let me eat , in order that my soul may bless you before I die . ”
Jacob replied : “ I am Esau your firstborn . ”
The Bible does not give all the details as to why Rebekah and Jacob acted as they did , though it does indicate that the situation arose suddenly .
We should note that God’s Word neither justifies nor condemns what Rebekah and Jacob did , establishing no precedent for lies and deception .
The Bible does , however , shed light on the situation .
Second , when Isaac realized that he had given the blessing to Jacob , he did not seek to change what he had done .
If God had not wanted the blessing to go to Jacob , he could have intervened in some way .
I did it out of kindness . Not for recognition or glory . ”
Local people came to the aid of those strangers , showing “ extraordinary human kindness . ”
The tendency to help others , even at personal cost , is so common that some term it “ humanness . ”
He also said : “ Some people sacrificially give of themselves to those who are outside their group and with whom they have absolutely nothing in common . . . .
That doesn’t seem like it can be explained by a Darwinian model . ”
In his letter to the Romans , Paul showed that humans are accountable to God because His existence and qualities are evident from what is seen .

Many respond , ‘ That’s not fair ! ’
A Cambridge professor noted that the standards of Babylonians , Egyptians , and Greeks as well as of Australian Aborigines and Native Americans included “ denunciations of oppression , murder , treachery and falsehood , the same injunctions of kindness to the aged , the young , and the weak . ” And Dr .
Your conscience may help you to assess a future act and suggest how you would feel if you performed it .
Conscience often comes into play in what way ?
Yes , the voice of “ the man we are inside ” may fail us .
That must have been the case with Saul too , for thereafter he was “ still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord . ”
One thing may have been his close contact with others .
Similarly , Saul may have been affected by close contact with Jews who hated Jesus and opposed his teachings .
How might one’s environment affect the conscience ?
Jehovah provided Adam and Eve with the gift of conscience , and we inherited our conscience from them .
They are like the Jews to whom Jesus said : “ You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure ; and you do not have his word remaining in you . ”
Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph .
Joseph knew God’s standard for marriage ​ — one man for one woman , the two being “ one flesh . ”
And he had likely heard of how Abimelech felt on learning that Rebekah was married ​ — that to take her would be wrong , bringing guilt on his people .
Joseph’s knowing all of that likely reinforced the proddings of his inherited conscience , moving him to reject sexual immorality . ​ — Genesis 2 : 24 ; 12 : 17 - 19 ; 20 : 1 - 18 ; 26 : 7 - 14 .
Of course , we are in a better situation now .
The more we are immersed in the Scriptures , the closer we can draw to God and be like him .
What about the environmental molding of our conscience ?
The next article will consider some situations that Christians have faced .
What Did You Learn ?
• What are some ways in which we can improve the voice we hear from within ?
We can train our conscience
Responding to Your Conscience
Titus ’ carrying out that assignment involved consciences .
These were “ subverting entire households by teaching things they ought not . ”
Congregations today are not being undermined by men with that particular outlook ; still we can learn much about the conscience from the counsel that Paul gave to Titus .
Note the setting in which Paul mentioned conscience .
Yet , some on Crete were still ‘ adhering to the circumcision . ’
Moreover , they judged fellow Christians on things that were personal , matters in which one Christian might decide one way but another might choose differently .
Well , observe the contrast found in this statement : “ All things are clean to clean persons . But to persons defiled and faithless nothing is clean , but both their minds and their consciences are defiled . ”
Paul certainly was not saying that for a morally clean Christian , absolutely everything is clean and permissible .
So we must conclude that Paul was stating a general truth about two types of people , those who are morally and spiritually clean and those who are not .
The things that a sincere Christian needs to avoid are not limited to what the Bible specifically prohibits .
Many teenagers claim that this practice is harmless because it is not sexual intercourse .
Hebrews 13 : 4 and 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 establish that God disapproves of both adultery and fornication ( Greek , por·neiʹa ) .
True Christians do not guide their thinking and actions by the opinions of “ profitless talkers , and deceivers of the mind . ”
If “ all things are clean , ” what is the role of the conscience ?
Rather than being judgmental , they recognize as “ clean ” things that God does not condemn .
They do not expect that all others will think exactly as they do about aspects of life on which the Bible does not give specific direction .
How might a wedding ( or a funeral ) present a challenge ?
There are many families in which one mate has become a Christian but the other mate has not .
Imagine the case of a Christian wife whose husband does not yet share her faith .
The couple are invited , and he wants his wife to accompany him .
Lois respects her husband and wants to cooperate with him , her Scriptural head ; yet , she does not want to compromise her Scriptural principles .
Ruth hopes that he will see the difference between true worship and false . ​ — Acts 24 : 16 .
In view of her past experience with the music and trappings of church ceremonies , Lois may sense that being present would be particularly dangerous for her .
So she is convinced that her decision is best for her .
A Christian’s spiritual development should be ongoing , as should his progress in hearing and responding to his conscience .
Let us imagine Mark , recently baptized .
The voice within him receives considerable training .
Now Mark is more inclined to listen to his conscience and to weigh Scriptural principles .
In fact , he realizes that some of the things “ vaguely similar ” that he shunned are actually not contrary to God’s thinking .
In most congregations , there are individuals at all stages of Christian development .
How Would You Answer ?
• Why did some Christians on Crete have consciences that were defiled ?
Cyprus
Would you not agree that this prophecy is being fulfilled ?
Can you see any value in being humble ?
The fact is that the Bible gives good reasons for valuing and cultivating humility .
How should we feel about our accomplishments ?
‘ Clothe Yourselves With Lowliness of Mind ’
THE man came from a prominent city .
Saul’s fellow Pharisees assumed an air of superiority and loved prominence and flattering titles .
Yes , Saul became a Christian , the apostle Paul , and his personality changed completely .
In contrast with him , we have to recognize our own limitations .
We are dependent on him .
Further , Jehovah values humility in his servants .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ God opposes the haughty ones , but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones . ”
In contrast , the Bible stresses that lowliness of mind leads to honor .
For instance , the wise man wrote : “ The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life . ”
It involves always submitting to God’s will instead of following the way of least resistance or succumbing to fleshly inclinations .
Developing humility requires moral strength , for we need to push aside personal interests in order to serve Jehovah and the interests of others selflessly .
The Scriptures use the expression “ lowliness of mind ” to describe it . A humble mind - set results from a realistic assessment of ourselves ​ — our strengths and weaknesses , our successes and failures .
Following the example and the advice of Paul , we will see the wisdom of ‘ clothing ourselves with lowliness of mind . ’ ​ — Colossians 3 : 12 .

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Regarding Edom , Obadiah says : “ Because of the violence to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will have to be cut off to time indefinite . ”
If thieves had come into Edom , they would have taken only what they wanted .
Had harvesters come into her , they would have left behind some of the crop for gleaning .
vs 10 ​ — How was Edom “ cut off to time indefinite ” ?
Jehovah does not view the mistreatment of his people lightly .

Instead of obeying God’s command to “ go to Nineveh the great city , and proclaim against her ” a judgment message , Jonah flees in the opposite direction .
The unexpected outcome of his preaching work causes Jonah to become “ hot with anger . ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
3 : 3 ​ — Did the size of Nineveh really amount to “ a walking distance of three days ” ?
In ancient times , Nineveh was likely understood to include other settlements stretching from Khorsabad in the north to Nimrud in the south .
Jonah may already have known the Assyrian language , or he may have miraculously received the ability to speak it .
Another possibility is that he delivered his succinct message in Hebrew , with someone interpreting for him .
Deliberately scheduling other activities in order to avoid having a full share in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work is an indication of a wrong motive .
2 : 1 , 2 , 9 , 10 .
Similarly today , God’s adverse judgment can be averted if a sinner manifests genuine repentance .
Jehovah is patiently having the Kingdom message preached earth wide because ​ — as he did for the 120,000 men in Nineveh — ​ he feels sorry for those “ who do not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left . ”
But Jehovah will “ collect [ his people ] together . ”
Since 1919 , anointed Christians have been collected together “ like a flock in the pen . ”
The expressions “ many peoples ” and “ mighty nations ” do not refer to national groups or political entities .
Lessons for Us :
The Assyrians came as far as Jerusalem during Hezekiah’s reign .
How dangerous it would be for us to claim to serve God but seek first riches rather than “ the kingdom and his righteousness . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 33 ; 1 Timothy 6 : 9 , 10 .
3 : 4 .
3 : 8 .
5 : 7 , 8 .
7 : 18 , 19 .
As Jehovah is willing to pardon our errors , we should be willing to forgive those who sin against us .
Those who fight against God and his people “ will have to be cut off to time indefinite . ”
What valuable lessons the books of Obadiah , Jonah , and Micah teach us !
Picture the setting , as described in the Bible : “ It came about many days after Jehovah had given Israel rest from all their enemies all around , when Joshua was old and advanced in days , that Joshua proceeded to call all Israel , its older men and its heads and its judges and its officers , and to say to them : ‘ As for me , I have grown old , I have advanced in days . ’ ” ​ — Joshua 23 : 1 , 2 .
He had been an eyewitness to mighty acts of God , and he had seen the fulfillment of many of Jehovah’s promises .
Second , he would protect them .
How did Jehovah deliver the Israelites from Egypt , and what did this demonstrate ?
At the burning bush , Jehovah said to Moses : “ I am proceeding to go down to deliver [ my people ] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious , to a land flowing with milk and honey . ”
After the tenth plague struck dead the firstborn of Egypt , Pharaoh ordered the Israelites to leave ​ — and leave they did ! ​ — Exodus 12 : 29 - 32 .
That deliverance opened the way for Jehovah to adopt Israel as his chosen nation .
Reading about that deliverance strengthens our faith .
Jehovah utterly destroyed Pharaoh’s mighty military machine , protecting His people from certain defeat . ​ — Exodus 14 : 19 - 28 .
And what of their entry into the Promised Land ?
Yet , Jehovah said to Joshua : “ Get up , cross this Jordan , you and all this people , into the land that I am giving to them , to the sons of Israel .
Consider now the third assurance ​ — Jehovah would sustain his people .
On Friday morning , October 2 , 1914 , Charles Taze Russell , who took the lead at that time among the Bible Students , strode into the dining room at Bethel in Brooklyn , New York .
What deliverance occurred in 1919 , and for what did this pave the way ?
First came thousands , then hundreds of thousands , and now millions are taking a stand for pure worship !
What have you seen during your lifetime ?
What deliverance is yet to come ?
Why has there been a need for Jehovah’s protection in modern times ?
Are Jehovah’s people in modern times any different ?
And what of God’s modern - day servants who died faithful ?

Why do we need a thorough understanding of the reasons for our beliefs ?
What does Bible study involve ?
Understanding deep things requires study .
Over a period of years , they cover the entire range of Bible teachings .
Holy spirit acts through the congregation to help people adopt the attitude needed to understand “ the deep things of God . ” ​ — Acts 5 : 32 .
What “ the Deep Things of God ” Include
Paul went on to explain God’s will that also “ in the heavenly places there might be made known through the congregation the greatly diversified wisdom of God . ”
Next , Paul says that we should strive to “ grasp mentally with all the holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth ” of the Christian faith .
Examples of Deep Things
10 , 11 .
To broaden our understanding , we might ask : ‘ When did Jesus become the promised Seed ?
What scriptures show that all anointed Christians on earth constitute “ the faithful and discreet slave ” ?
What Bible texts prove that this understanding is correct ?
God told the nation of Israel : “ You are my witnesses . . . even my servant whom I have chosen . ”
Later that same day , when Jesus asked : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”
That spiritual nation , “ the Israel of God , ” became Jehovah’s new slave .
You could strengthen your faith by making a study of the prophecies pointing to Jesus Christ or a verse - by - verse consideration of one of the prophetic books of the Bible .
Faith - strengthening too is a review of the modern - day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses , using the book Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom , if you have this publication available in your language .
If you assign youngsters a subject to research in preparation for the family Bible study , you can ask them about what they learned .

The instructions for the essay noted : “ We do not need absolute truth .
That question , she noted , reflected a cynical attitude , as if saying : ‘ Truth ?
Yes , being alert to an opportunity to speak about your faith can bear fruit .
Assyria has also long been a menace to Judah .
Composed before 632 B.C.E . , the Bible book of Nahum contains that message .
“ Woe to the city of bloodshed ” ​ — Nineveh .
These gates referred to the opening made in the walls of Nineveh by the waters of the Tigris River .
Eventually , though , “ the king of Assyria came against [ Ahaz ] and caused him distress . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 28 : 20 .
‘ THE RIGHTEOUS ONE WILL KEEP LIVING ’
The first two chapters of the book of Habakkuk are a dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah God .
Distressed over what is taking place in Judah , Habakkuk asks God : “ Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful , and you keep looking upon mere trouble ? ”
The prophet expresses surprise that God would use “ those dealing treacherously ” to punish Judah .
The prayer concludes with the words : “ Jehovah the Sovereign Lord is my vital energy ; and he will make my feet like those of the hinds , and upon my high places he will cause me to tread . ” ​ — Habakkuk 3 : 1 , 19 .
2 : 5 ​ — Who is the “ able - bodied man , ” and why “ will [ he ] not reach his goal ” ?
Habakkuk asked sincere questions , and Jehovah answered him .
2 : 4 .
Nothing will be able to stand in the way of Jehovah when he executes his judgment , not even human organizations that seem as permanent as the mountains and the hills .
We have the assurance that the destruction at Armageddon will not be random .
( Zephaniah 1 : 1 – 3 : 20 )
Jehovah says through his prophet Zephaniah : “ I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem . ”
Since Nineveh was to become a place for wild animals and birds , the voice that would keep singing refers to birdsong and possibly to the sound of the wind in the windows of deserted buildings .
Jehovah kept sending his prophets to warn his people of his judicial decisions .
2 : 3 .
How much longer , though , must we wait ?
The book of Zephaniah also shows us how we may be concealed in that day and what we must do now to prepare for survival .
JEHOVAH’S servants must sometimes develop skills and attitudes that will help them to do his will .
We will discuss what questions related to the disciple - making work ?
How can we cultivate such traits ?
Manifest Deep Love for God
These words of the psalmist apply to Jesus : “ To do your will , O my God , I have delighted , and your law is within my inward parts . I have told the good news of righteousness in the big congregation . Look !
Love for God is the key factor that motivates us to engage in the disciple - making work .
Let us therefore keep that love alive by regularly reading and meditating on his Word . ​ — 1 Timothy 4 : 6 , 15 ; Revelation 2 : 4 .
Love for Jehovah unquestionably helped to make Jesus Christ a zealous teacher .
7 , 8 .
Jesus was concerned about people and showed keen interest in them .
Jesus reflected Jehovah’s own love and compassion , and this attracted people to the worship of the only true God .
Such deep and loving concern for fellow humans made Jesus more effective than anyone else in drawing individuals to true worship .
Effective disciple - makers have a self - sacrificing spirit .
They surely do not view the acquisition of wealth to be of utmost importance .
Why does a spirit of self - sacrifice help us to make disciples ?
But more is needed to be an effective disciple maker .
Like farmers , Christians are cultivating things that often grow slowly ​ — understanding of God’s Word , love for Jehovah , and a Christlike spirit .
Although we are patient , how can we use our time wisely as disciple makers ?
For example , many sayings of the Great Teacher , Jesus Christ , were especially powerful because of their simplicity .
Of course , Jesus did not make only short statements .
An unprepared minister tends to talk too much .
He may virtually drown the main points in an excessive flow of words , saying everything he knows on a subject .
Instead , with tact , good illustrations , and thoughtful questions , we can help them to appreciate the Scriptural points presented in our Bible - based publications .
Thus , all Christians can rejoice that hundreds of thousands of new disciples are made each year .
Above all , make your desire to teach the truth a matter of prayer .
Find comfort in the knowledge that everything you do in Jehovah’s service contributes to the disciple - making work that glorifies God .
Can You Explain ?
By making disciples , Christians demonstrate their deep love for God

[ Picture on page 24 ]
This can be done by imitating Jesus Christ , the Great Teacher and Disciple Maker . ​ — John 13 : 13 .
Imitating Jesus can have what effect on your efforts to make disciples ?
If you imitate Jesus ’ teaching methods , you will be complying with the apostle Paul’s admonition : “ Go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside , buying out the opportune time for yourselves .
He went there to listen , although he also asked questions .
He did not become so absorbed in what he was teaching that he forgot about those who came to hear him speak .
He then asked her : “ Do you believe this ? ”
Jesus showed respect and concern for this woman , whereupon she told others about him , and “ many of the Samaritans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman . ” ​ — John 4 : 5 - 29 , 39 - 42 .
People usually enjoy expressing their views .
Listen to the person’s viewpoint , and comment on it , or ask a question about it .
In answer the one named Cleopas said to him : ‘ Are you dwelling as an alien by yourself in Jerusalem and so do not know the things that have occurred in her in these days ? ’
Now some were saying that he had been raised from the dead .
Then he explained what they needed to know , “ fully opening up the Scriptures ” to them . ​ — Luke 24 : 13 - 27 , 32 .
The answer may reveal a lot about the person’s viewpoint and religious background .
The perfect man Jesus had discernment that enabled him to identify those who deserved to be taught .
Like Jesus ’ apostles , you must search for people who are willing to listen and to be taught Scriptural truth .
You can find deserving ones by listening carefully to one person after another , taking note of the attitude of each individual .
In some areas , it is effective to ask , “ Have you found the Bible hard to understand ? ”
Another way is to read a scripture and ask , “ How does that sound to you ? ”
Follow Jesus ’ method .
Jesus was also a kind listener who refreshed sincere people and put them at ease .
Those words were so intriguing that Nicodemus could not hold back from responding and listening to Jesus .
Today , many children are becoming disciples of Jesus .
Then you can use appropriate scriptures to help your child understand Jehovah’s view of matters .
Whether you are discussing a subject with your child or anyone else , good listening is vital .
By listening , you are acting in a humble way , and the one speaking is being shown respect and loving consideration .
Then endeavor to help them by employing Jesus ’ various methods of teaching .
• How did Jesus encourage others to express their thoughts ?
• How can you use questions in your ministry ?
IS OUR world on the threshold of peace or on the brink of disaster ?
It seems that a case could be made for either view .
What would happen if they did ?
“ Anything that divides people can spawn hostility , and religion is one of the strongest dividers , ” writes journalist James A .
“ For good people to do evil , ” he writes , “ that takes religion . ”
But the source of world unity is not man or man - made religions , as we will see .
Consider : Throughout history , thousands of peace treaties have been made and broken .
Such a view would be absurd !
The goal of the NPT , which has now been ratified by more than 180 nations , is eventually to achieve complete disarmament .
Even nations that already have nuclear weapons may disregard the NPT .
This comes as no surprise to Bible students , for God’s Word says : “ It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step . ”
Yet , God’s purpose from the very beginning has been for mankind to live in peace and harmony .
• “ Come , you people , behold the activities of Jehovah , how he has set astonishing events on the earth .
• “ He will actually swallow up death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces . And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth , for Jehovah himself has spoken it . ” ​ — ISAIAH 25 : 8 .
As noted in the preceding article , religion has often played a role in dividing rather than uniting mankind .
This is cause for serious consideration , for if we accept that there is a Creator , is it not reasonable to expect that worshippers of him would be at peace and in unity with one another ?
It is in vain that they keep worshiping me , because they teach commands of men as doctrines . ’ ” ​ — Matthew 15 : 7 - 9 .
The prophet Isaiah foretold : “ It must occur in the final part of the days that the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains , and it will certainly be lifted up above the hills ; and to it all the nations must stream .
And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears . Nation will not lift up sword against nation , neither will they learn war anymore . ” ​ — Isaiah 2 : 2 , 4 .
As recorded at Matthew 7 : 12 , Jesus Christ stated : “ All things , therefore , that you want men to do to you , you also must likewise do to them . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are determined to prove themselves to be Christ’s disciples by observing what Jesus said : “ All will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ”
Even now , however , individuals can clothe themselves with love and achieve unity .
Accurate knowledge of God’s Word has united millions , some of whom once harbored hatred for one another .

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Jehovah raises up the prophet Haggai and two months later the prophet Zechariah to speak His word .
Like those prophets , we too have a God - given work , which must be brought to completion before the end of the present system of things .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
Because of the lack of Jehovah’s blessing , the supply of wine would be limited ​ — definitely not sufficient to cause intoxication .
The Jews in Haggai’s day were working hard in personal pursuits but not enjoying the fruits of their labor .
We should likewise strive to be forward - looking as we worship our God .
‘ NOT BY POWER , BUT BY MY SPIRIT ’
Zechariah begins his prophetic activity with a call to the Jews to ‘ return to Jehovah . ’
The eight visions that follow ensure divine backing on the work of rebuilding the temple .
( See the box “ Zechariah’s Eight Allegorical Visions . ” )
Jehovah tells Zechariah that the mourning during the four fasts held in remembrance of the calamity that befell Jerusalem will be changed into “ an exultation and a rejoicing and good festal seasons . ”
As Joshua served the returned Jews as high priest at the rebuilt temple , so Jesus is the High Priest for true worship at Jehovah’s spiritual temple .
8 : 1 - 23 ​ — When are the ten pronouncements mentioned in these verses fulfilled ?
Zechariah is portrayed as one sent to “ shepherd the flock meant for the killing ” ​ — sheeplike people exploited by their leaders .
The cutting up of “ Pleasantness ” symbolized that God would end the Law covenant with the Jews and stop dealing pleasantly with them .
12 : 11 ​ — What is “ the wailing of Hadadrimmon in the valley plain of Megiddo ” ?
King Josiah of Judah was killed in a battle with Pharaoh Necho of Egypt in “ the valley plain of Megiddo , ” and his death was bemoaned ‘ in dirges ’ over the years .
Lessons for Us :
Jehovah is pleased with and returns to those who repentantly accept reproof and return to him by rendering him whole - souled worship .
Whatever problems we may encounter in our service to God can be overcome by exercising faith in Jehovah . ​ — Matthew 17 : 20 .
Living up to Jehovah’s expectations is not too difficult for imperfect humans .
8 : 9 - 13 .
Those in positions of oversight among Jehovah’s people should be “ like a fiery torch ” ​ — outstandingly zealous .
Only a third part underwent refinement as through fire .
What an impact meditation on the fulfillment of such Messianic prophecies of Zechariah has on our faith !
Our confidence in the Word of Jehovah and in his provisions for our salvation is strengthened . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .

Hence , The Watchtower will continue to honor Jehovah as the true God and to comfort its readers with the good news of his Kingdom .
The articles on pages 5 to 9 of this issue discuss what that Kingdom is and when it will come .
In addition , The Watchtower will continue to promote faith in Jesus Christ , advocate Bible truth , and explain the meaning of world events in the light of Bible prophecies , as it has been doing for many decades .
will share interesting background information that sheds light on the meaning of selected Bible accounts .
A number of regular features are designed to benefit families .
The feature “ A Letter From . . . ” will present a first - person report from missionaries and others in various parts of the world .
IMAGINE hundreds of millions , even billions , of people , all asking for the same thing .
Could such a thing really happen ?
By one estimate , there are some 37,000 religions that call themselves Christian , claiming Jesus Christ as their Leader .
They have also recited them in family groups and as individuals , in good times and in bad .
A Request That Crosses Religious Borders
Why do so many ask for something they cannot define ?
Is it because the Kingdom of God is a complex , vague concept ?
Then we will see when Jesus ’ prayer for the Kingdom to come will be answered .
Did they ask him what this Kingdom was ?
No .
Much later , faithful King David was told something thrilling about this “ seed , ” or Messiah .
This government would differ from all others .
God “ will actually swallow up death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces . ” ​ — Isaiah 25 : 8 .
God’s Kingdom has a Ruler chosen by God .
The very titles Messiah and Christ suggest as much .
My servant , on whom I keep fast hold !
My chosen one , whom my soul has approved ! I have put my spirit in him . Justice to the nations is what he will bring forth . ”
He was unselfish , compassionate , courageous , and humble .
God’s Kingdom has 144,000 corulers with the Christ .
Jesus said that others , including his apostles , would rule in heaven with him .
God’s Kingdom , now ruling in heaven , is poised to establish its rule over the whole earth .
Such prophecies as this one show that God’s Kingdom is not something within our heart , as many have been taught .
See the article “ Our Readers Ask , ” on page 13 .
See , for example , Matthew 3 : 17 ; Luke 2 : 10 - 14 ; John 6 : 5 - 14 .
When Will God’s Kingdom Come ?
Today , some 2,000 years later , people are still eager to know : When will God’s Kingdom come ?
Since Jesus made the Kingdom the theme of his preaching , you might expect that he discussed this question .
He spoke extensively about a marked period of time that he called his “ presence . ”
Thus , Jesus said : “ The kingdom of God is not coming with striking observableness . ”
Jesus said that his presence as King in heaven would be marked on earth by wars , famines , earthquakes , pestilences , and lawlessness .
The Bible explains that Satan , “ the ruler of this world , ” is full of rage because he knows that his time is very short now that Christ’s presence as King has begun .
Such visible evidence of Satan’s rage and of Christ’s presence has been abundant in our time .
Especially since 1914 , a year that historians acknowledge was a turning point , has this evidence appeared on an unprecedented and global scale .
How , though , would people know about that Kingdom in order to accept its rule and become its subjects ?
As we saw in the preceding article , God’s Kingdom will destroy all the governments of this world .
We urge you to take hold of the marvelous opportunity before you .

His father looks down the list of subjects and notices a failing grade in one of the classes .
The father immediately gets angry , thinking back to the many times the boy put off doing his homework .
They may take one failure or weakness and exaggerate its importance , so that it begins to define how they see themselves .
That , of course , is not only discouraging but also untrue .
Children ​ — really , all members of the family — ​ thrive in a peaceful , loving environment .
Would it not have been better if he had taken the time to search for “ delightful words ” of truth rather than just to blurt out his frustration to his wife ?
Will angry , critical words ever motivate her to want to improve ? ’
What , though , if our family discussions repeatedly end up in an argument ?
Jesus said : “ Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks . ”
Do we tend to be rigid , pessimistic , or judgmental ?
But we must beware of self - deception . ​ — Proverbs 14 : 12 .
It will take humility to accept what they have to say and to make any adjustments that may be needed .
In the final analysis , if we really want to avoid hurting others with our speech , we have to do what Proverbs 16 : 23 says : “ Intelligent [ that is , wise ] people think before they speak ; what they say is then more persuasive . ”
At times , we all speak thoughtlessly .
But with the help of God’s Word , we can learn to think before we speak and to put the feelings and interests of others ahead of our own .
Then our speech will not hurt and tear down but heal and build up those whom we love . ​ — Romans 14 : 19 .
How can you avoid saying something you will later regret ?
Did You Know ?
However , these valuable gifts may have been timely and useful in financing the stay of Jesus ’ family in Egypt . ​ — Matthew 2 : 13 - 15 .
Consider the account recorded in John chapter 11 .
Is Evolution Compatible With the Bible ?
We cannot enjoy a fine standing with God if we are not sure that he is our Creator .
Evolutionists generally claim that a population of animals gradually developed into a population of humans , denying that there was once only one man .
When addressing well - educated religious leaders , he said : “ Did you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female ? ”
Jesus then quoted the words about Adam and Eve recorded at Genesis 2 : 24 .
Luke , a Bible writer and a careful historian , presented Adam as a person who was as real as Jesus .
Jehovah would not have declared the creation of man to be “ very good ” if the man had a tendency to get sick or to rebel .
If God guided the process of evolution , it would mean that he guided mankind into its present diseased and distressed state .
Is evolution compatible with what the Bible says about Jesus ?
Can You Believe in Both Evolution and Christianity ?
Therefore , the Bible says : “ All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ”
How does Jesus ’ death help us ?
Thus , all who exercise faith in Jesus and obey him will receive what Adam forfeited ​ — the prospect of everlasting life . ​ — John 3 : 16 ; Romans 6 : 23 .
Do you see , then , that evolution is incompatible with Christianity ?
Why Evolution Attracts People
It says : “ There will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching , but , in accord with their own desires , they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled ; and they will turn their ears away from the truth , whereas they will be turned aside to false stories . ”
Its beliefs are subtly attractive to mankind’s selfish , independent tendencies .
“ There is no publication in the scientific literature ​ — in prestigious journals , specialty journals , or books — ​ that describes how molecular evolution of any real , complex , biochemical system either did occur or even might have occurred . . . .
The assertion of Darwinian molecular evolution is merely bluster . ”
They are similar to those described in the apostle Paul’s letter to Christians in Rome .
His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward , because they are perceived by the things made , even his eternal power and Godship , so that they are inexcusable ; because , although they knew God , they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him , but they became empty - headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened .
Evidence - Based Faith in the Creator
Taking the time to examine the consistency of its 66 books , the superiority of its moral standards , and the unfailing fulfillment of its prophecies will provide you with abundant evidence that its author is the Creator .
[ Blurb on page 14 ]
Man’s inability to predict the future accurately is notorious .
That the Bible is a book of prophecy should therefore stimulate all truth - seekers to investigate its claim of divine authorship .
Of course , one might argue that anyone can predict that a nation , however mighty , will eventually pass out of existence .
For example , it provided details as to just how Babylon would be overthrown .
This was fulfilled , and the Jews ’ descendants continue to exist as a distinct people to this day .
This proved true as well .
In addition , Jehovah predicted that Greece would be overthrown as a world power , but never did he say that this nation would cease to exist .
Similarly , in foretelling the downfall of Tyre , the book of Ezekiel said that its stones , woodwork , and dust would be placed “ in the very midst of the water . ”
The prophecy recorded at Daniel 8 : 5 - 8 , 21 , 22 and 11 : 3 , 4 also provided impressive details with regard to an unusually great “ king of Greece . ”
This ruler would be cut down at the zenith of his power , and his kingdom would then be divided into four but not among his descendants .
For that matter , why did he not mention the names of the great king and his four generals ?
The claim that Bible prophecy was written after the event is a long - held but unproven assertion made by those who before examining the evidence have decided that foretelling future events is impossible .
Nevertheless , God wisely inspired just enough prophetic detail to establish his authorship .

Here is another thought to ponder .
If you put these principles to work in your life , you can be confident that they will prove true for you .

What kind of Father is Jehovah ?
To answer that , let us examine the words Jehovah spoke to Jesus on the occasion of Jesus ’ baptism .
First , by the words “ this is my Son , ” Jehovah was saying , in effect , ‘ I am proud to be your Father . ’
A discerning father satisfies his children’s hunger for recognition and attention .
Third , by the words “ I have approved , ” Jehovah expressed his approval of his Son .
It was as if Jehovah were saying , ‘ Son , I am pleased with what you have done . ’
Surely it must have encouraged Jesus to hear that he had his Father’s approval !
He Stood Up for Pure Worship
Even in the light of early morning , the poverty and want afflicting these people were plain to see .
How did he feel as that day dawned ?
What , though , had brought Israel to this crisis ?
For much of his life , Elijah had helplessly watched as the best thing about his homeland and his people was pushed aside and trampled underfoot .
King Ahab had married Jezebel , the daughter of the king of Sidon .
Ahab quickly fell under her influence .
What made Baal worship so offensive ?
Some might assume that a story about Baal worship is irrelevant now , since we do not see temples and altars to Baal around us .
Indeed , whether people use their life in the service of money , career , recreation , sexual pleasure , or any of the countless gods that are worshipped instead of Jehovah , they choose a master .
That ancient contest between Jehovah and Baal can help us make a wise choice as to whom we will serve .
They thought that they could have it both ways ​ — that they could appease Baal with their revolting rituals and still ask favors of Jehovah God .
He demands and is worthy of exclusive devotion .
Elijah’s clarion call to stop limping can help us to reexamine our own priorities and worship .
He gave his opponents every advantage , letting them choose their bull to sacrifice and approach Baal first .
We may be just as confident in him as Elijah was .
The Baal prophets proceeded to set up their sacrifice and call upon their god .
“ O Baal , answer us ! ” they cried again and again .
They kept at it as the minutes and then the hours passed by .
Then as now , choosing any master other than Jehovah leads to disappointment , even shame . ​ — Psalm 25 : 3 ; 115 : 4 - 8 .
The Answer
Despite all the misery that they had caused by their faithlessness , Elijah still loved them .
Before Elijah’s prayer , the crowds there might have wondered if Jehovah would turn out to be an empty lie as Baal was .
The account says : “ At that the fire of Jehovah came falling and went eating up the burnt offering and the pieces of wood and the stones and the dust , and the water that was in the trench it licked up . ”
What a spectacular answer !
Some may worry lest religious zealots use it to justify violent acts of religious intolerance .
Furthermore , genuine Christians know that they cannot follow Elijah’s course in taking a sword to the wicked .
He worshipped Jehovah exclusively and urged others to do the same .
Some scholars say that such idolaters sometimes used altars with a secret cavity beneath so that a fire could appear to be lit supernaturally .
“ Jehovah is the true God ! ”
As you read the scriptures , imagine that you are part of the event .

Finding Relief From Youthful Despair
In September 1993 , I visited a maximum - security prison .
Fear was a part of our lives , and it hurt me deeply to see Mother suffer .
Another priest sexually abused pupils while reviewing their homework with them .
Furthermore , such Catholic teachings as hellfire confused and frightened me .
My devotion to God soon withered .
Even at those places , drugs were common .
Although I was dissatisfied , I lured one of my younger brothers , José Luis , and a close friend , Miguel , into the same lifestyle .
Jehovah Comes to the Rescue
Francisco was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and he gave me an issue of The Watchtower that contained an article on drugs .
After reading the article , I prayed to God for help : “ Lord , I know that you exist , and I want to know you and to do your will .
I asked Francisco for a Bible , and he gave me one along with the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life .
The friendliness and warmth I found there impressed me greatly .
She was obviously startled at seeing this group of long - haired hippies , and she was careful not to turn her head again .
Soon afterward , Miguel and I also attended a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
We had never experienced anything like that before ​ — a true brotherhood of people of all ages .
Our entire group began to study the Bible .
She was the young girl who looked aghast when she saw us on our first visit to the Kingdom Hall .
A Beloved One Is Redeemed
In 1989 , Soledad and I were assigned to the area where Mariví was imprisoned .
After studying for a month , she stopped using drugs and tobacco .
One day Mariví informed me of her desire to dedicate her life to Jehovah and get baptized .
As a result of her former lifestyle , Mariví developed AIDS .
She lived at home with Mother and led an active Christian life until her death two years later .
Overcoming Destructive Feelings
In my adult life , I have often been plagued by feelings of guilt and a lack of self - worth .
My wife and I have each spent nearly 30 years as full - time ministers of the good news .

Our Readers Ask
Many today believe that the answer to the above question is yes .
Some translations here say : “ The kingdom of God is within you ” or even “ inside you . ”
First , consider what the human heart is .
When referred to in the Bible , the figurative heart means the inner person , the source of a person’s thoughts , attitudes , and feelings .
The idea that something as sublime as the Kingdom of God resides within the human heart ​ — in the way it changes and ennobles people , for example — ​ may sound appealing , but does it stand to reason ?
Jesus himself said : “ From inside , out of the heart of men , injurious reasonings issue forth : fornications , thieveries , murders , adulteries , covetings , acts of wickedness . ”
Second , consider the audience Jesus was addressing when he spoke the words found at Luke 17 : 21 .
The Pharisees were Jesus ’ enemies .
Now if the Pharisees were not to enter God’s Kingdom , could the Kingdom be in their hearts ?
What , then , did Jesus mean ?
In rendering these words of Jesus , a number of careful Bible translations use wording similar to that found in the New World Translation .
As the King - Designate , Jesus was right in the midst of those people .

Purpose of Study Articles
They will remind you of why you need to be zealous , show you how to improve your “ art of teaching , ” and encourage you by demonstrating that many are still responding to the preaching work .
The New Study Edition of The Watchtower
The schedule for considering these study articles is printed on the cover of the magazine .
Some cited scriptures are marked “ read ” and should be read and discussed during the Watchtower Study .
The annual report will no longer appear in The Watchtower .
They too contain spiritual food from “ the faithful and discreet slave . ” ​ — Matt .
They have on page 2 identical paragraphs explaining the purpose of The Watchtower .
Since 1879 , through periods of war , economic hardship , and persecution , The Watchtower has faithfully proclaimed truths about God’s Kingdom .
We pray that with Jehovah’s blessing , it will continue to do so in its new format .
Failure to assume the responsibility of warning people of the choice that lies before them could result in our incurring bloodguilt .
24 : 11 , 12 .
He urges his servants to make all possible efforts to help save as many lives as they can .
What topics will this and the following two articles discuss ?
Even for people who endeavor to live by Bible standards , these are “ critical times hard to deal with . ” ​ — Matt .
“ Babylon the Great , ” the world empire of false religion , has brought little comfort to the masses .
Moreover , by acting like a harlot , false religion has seduced and controlled “ the kings of the earth , ” using lying doctrines and spiritistic practices to keep the masses in passive subservience to their political masters .
17 : 1 , 2 , 5 ; 18 : 23 .
Jesus taught that most of mankind are traveling along the broad road that leads to destruction .
Jesus said that his disciples would preach the good news of the Kingdom and make disciples .
True Christians , therefore , have always considered participation in the preaching work to be a matter of loyalty to God and a fundamental requirement of their faith .
When opposition turned violent , did Jesus ’ followers waver in their determination to preach the good news ?
Most servants of God today have not had to endure beatings or imprisonment because of their preaching activities .
Courage is needed for us to keep on preaching the Kingdom message .
Notice how he reacted to such opposition : “ After we had first suffered and been insolently treated , ” he wrote , “ we mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God with a great deal of struggling . ”
12 , 13 .
We might find it necessary to muster up extra boldness to speak to people in informal settings .
Other difficulties that many have to contend with are advancing age and poor health , which may limit what they can reasonably do in the preaching work .
Jehovah is well aware of your limitations and appreciates what you can do .
In his letter to the Colossians , Paul wrote : “ Tell Archippus : ‘ Keep watching the ministry which you accepted in the Lord , that you fulfill it . ’ ”
If you are a dedicated Christian , you too have accepted a ministry .
Are you continuing to watch the ministry in order to fulfill it ?
So we do well to ask ourselves now , ‘ Is the doing of God’s will really the most important thing in my life ? ’
Could you perhaps have even greater joy ?
In some territories , much work still needs to be done to reach everybody with the life - giving message of truth .
Yet , “ how . . . will they hear without someone to preach ? ”
[ Footnote ]
Pay Attention to Your “ Art of Teaching ”
4 : 2 .
What command did Jesus give to his disciples , and what example did he set ?
DESPITE the wonderful works of healing that Jesus performed during his earthly ministry , he was primarily known , not as a healer or a miracle worker , but as a teacher .
Declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom was Jesus ’ priority , and so it is for his followers today .
Christians have a commission to continue the work of disciple - making by teaching people to observe all the things that Jesus commanded . ​ — Matt .
In order to fulfill our commission to make disciples , we constantly seek to improve our ability to teach .
That is an art .
( Read Psalm 119 : 27 , 34 . )
Observing effective ministers as they teach helps us to learn their methods and to imitate them .
4 : 13 - 15 .
Jesus , the greatest of all human teachers , based his teachings on the Scriptures .
Whatever point we are striving to help a student grasp , the best method we can use is to have him or her read what the Scriptures say about it . ​ — Read Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Generally speaking , it is good to read those scriptures that provide the basis for our beliefs .
So instead of explaining scriptures to your student , ask him to explain them to you .
No doubt , the majority of people with whom you study the Bible will quickly be able to answer the printed questions , using the information in the corresponding paragraphs .
It may be , though , that people with whom we study the Bible have been confused by the doctrines of false religion .
What lesson regarding teaching can we learn from the apostle Paul ?
The student has to understand how the information applies to him personally , how it benefits him , and how his life would improve if he followed Scriptural direction . ​ — Isa .
48 : 17 , 18 .
His motivation for responding to Scriptural commands should be his desire to obey Jehovah , not to please the person who is studying with him . ​ — Gal .
14 , 15 . ( a ) What can a Bible student learn about Jehovah ?
The Israelites thus came to know Jehovah in the roles of Savior , Warrior , Provider , and Fulfiller of promises and in other capacities . ​ — Ex .
23 : 14 .
3 : 5 , 6 .
What a joy it is to help Bible students develop their own relationship with Jehovah !
The answer to this question will be considered in the following article .
[ Picture on page 10 ]
“ Rightly Disposed ” Ones Are Responding
THE Bible book of Acts preserves the exciting account of how the early Christians responded to Jesus ’ prophecy that the good news of the Kingdom would be preached throughout the inhabited earth .

Early missionaries helped many more to embrace Christianity .
So zealous were those first - century Christian preachers that their enemies claimed that they had “ overturned the inhabited earth . ” ​ — Acts 17 : 6 ; 28 : 22 .
Today , as in the first century , “ all those who [ are ] rightly disposed for everlasting life ” are responding to the message of truth .
What attitude toward the Christian ministry do we need to maintain in order to cooperate fully with this ingathering work ?
Consider for a moment : Are you not grateful that the person who first spoke to you about Scriptural truths was free of prejudices toward you ?
So why hold back from offering a potentially lifesaving message to anyone who might listen to it ? ​ — Read Matthew 7 : 12 .
( b ) What should the apostle Paul’s experience teach us ?
Saul , a Pharisee , was a bitter opposer of Christians .
Yet , Jesus saw something good in Saul’s heart and chose him to fulfill a special commission .
Though it may appear doubtful that any of them will ever become true Christians , we should not stop trying to reason with them .
He is also grateful for the open - mindedness of the Kingdom publishers who made the effort to study with him .
Why do we keep returning to visit people ?
( Read Ecclesiastes 9 : 11 . )
Such developments can cause a person who was previously apathetic ​ — or even opposed — ​ to respond favorably .
In our ministry , we should strive to do the same .
13 , 14 . ( a ) Why did a pioneer react negatively to a woman she met in the ministry ?
Sandra , a pioneer sister , was engaged in the house - to - house ministry on an island in the Caribbean when she met Ruth , who was deeply involved in carnival celebrations .
Ruth had twice been crowned national carnival queen .
I wrongly assumed that someone who was so popular and so involved in carnival festivities could not have an interest in the truth .
Take , for example , the case of Joyce , a Christian sister in the United States .
Joyce says : “ I cried for joy .
Reports from countries around the world show that many honesthearted individuals are responding well to the Bible study aid What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Her life had been threatened , her home had been burned down , and she had been gang - raped .
All of this made her feel that she had nothing to live for , and she considered suicide on a number of occasions .
What a joy it is to help sincere people understand and appreciate the hope offered by the Scriptures !
With each passing day , the urgency of our commission to preach and make disciples becomes more pressing .
Thousands of rightly disposed ones respond to our preaching every year .
Thousands of honesthearted individuals are responding

After graduation , she was offered a full - time position that demanded much of her time but paid handsomely .
6 : 19 - 24 , 33 .
“ We Feel Closer to Jehovah Than Ever Before ”
Therefore , we resolved to simplify our lifestyle .
We prayed to Jehovah for wisdom in reaching our goal and set a specific date for making ourselves available to serve Jehovah to a fuller extent . ”
However , like Marc , I wanted to make myself available to serve Jehovah wherever there was a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers .
Yet , when I handed in my resignation , my supervisor said that I qualified for the position of executive secretary that had just opened up .
Amy , mentioned earlier , chose a different course .
Looking back on that time , Amy notes : “ Financially , I was well - off .
Then I finally realized that by pursuing a career in this world , I had nearly been ‘ led astray from the faith . ’
As a consequence , exactly as God’s Word states , I was suffering ‘ many pains . ’ ” ​ — 1 Tim .
What did Amy do ?
Can you adjust your circumstances and simplify your lifestyle ?
If you use the time that will become available in order to advance Kingdom interests , you too will enrich your life . ​ — Prov .
See Insight on the Scriptures , Volume 2 , pages 1207 - 8 .
I really thought that it would take some time for me to get used to pioneering , but I love it already !
1 : 5 .
He said : “ Now [ God ] is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent .
Jehovah chooses others from among mankind to reign with Jesus and judge during that millennium - long day .
( Read Genesis 22 : 17 , 18 . )
Jesus would spend the next three and a half years preaching the good news of the Kingdom to the Jewish nation .
What blessings are opened up to members of Abraham’s seed ?
However , for them , that was only a beginning .
2 : 10 .
For example , the apostle Paul wrote to anointed Christians in Thessalonica : “ As a father does his children , we kept exhorting each one of you , and consoling and bearing witness to you , to the end that you should go on walking worthily of God who is calling you to his kingdom and glory . ” ​ — 1 Thess .
The Hebrew Scriptures were written in the first place for the fleshly nation of Israel during the time that they had a special relationship with God .
Similarly , Christians who are not anointed with holy spirit derive immeasurable benefits from studying and living according to the counsel found in the Christian Greek Scriptures . ​ — Read 2 Timothy 3 : 15 - 17 .
What reminder did Paul give to anointed Christians ?
Evidently , some early Christians lost sight of that fact and began seeking undue prominence among their brothers in the congregation .
And I wish indeed that you had begun ruling as kings , that we also might rule with you as kings . ”
What has occurred in our time with regard to the calling of the anointed ?
In some cases , it could be that they replaced individuals previously called who had become unfaithful .
Jehovah has evidently made sure that we will have anointed Christians among us all through the final days of this system of things until the destruction of “ Babylon the Great . ”
God’s Heavenly Government Is Almost Complete !
Millions of other sheep , when contemplating the faith of their anointed brothers , agree with the words of the apostle Paul , who said of anointed brothers in Thessalonica : “ We ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the tribulations that you are bearing . This is a proof of the righteous judgment of God , leading to your being counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are indeed suffering . ”
What a cause for joy that will be ​ — both in heaven and on earth !
• What confidence do all Christians have ?
Jesus encouraged his followers to reach out for the Kingdom
Counted Worthy to Be Guided to Fountains of Waters of Life
Hence , Jesus , the Master , was pleased thereafter to appoint them “ over all his belongings . ”
In this way , before receiving a heavenly inheritance , anointed ones serve other worshippers of Jehovah here on earth .
A master has authority over his belongings , or possessions , and he can use them as he chooses .
John describes the great crowd as follows : “ Look ! a great crowd , which no man was able to number , out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , dressed in white robes ; and there were palm branches in their hands . ” ​ — Rev .
They can draw close to Jehovah , and as a group , they have the wonderful prospect of surviving Armageddon .
They are not independent but willing to serve under the direction of the heavenly King and his anointed brothers on earth .
Thus , one aspect of the support that the anointed receive from the other sheep is that qualified men of the great crowd serve as congregation elders .
How was the support of anointed Christians by their other sheep companions prophesied ?
The willing support given to anointed Christians by their companions of the other sheep was foretold by the prophet Isaiah .
In a symbolic way , Christians with an earthly hope today walk behind the anointed slave class and its Governing Body , following their leadership .
First , they support the anointed in proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom .
Second , they willingly submit themselves to the direction provided by the Governing Body . ​ — Heb . 13 : 17 ; read Zechariah 8 : 23 .
What is the determination of members of the great crowd ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 8 . )
Similarly , although persecution has sometimes slowed down the preaching work , often it has served only to strengthen the faith of those persecuted .
First - century Christians were warned about this danger when they were told : “ Consider closely the one [ Christ ] who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests . ”
“ That you may not get tired and give out in your souls . ” ​ — Heb .
Jehovah has promised to help those serving him to regain power , and his promise is sure .
( Read Isaiah 40 : 30 , 31 . )
Describe the interchange that will take place between survivors of the great tribulation and resurrected righteous ones .
Think how thrilling it will be to learn personal details about Jesus from his cousin John the Baptist !
The things we learn from such faithful witnesses will doubtless give us an even greater appreciation of God’s Word than we have at present .
What a joy it will be for them to continue their service under the much more favorable circumstances of the new world ! ​ — Heb .
By the end of Judgment Day , each individual will have had ample opportunity to show where he stands on the issue of universal sovereignty .
Only the wicked will be everlastingly destroyed . ​ — Rev .
With what joyful anticipation do anointed Christians and the other sheep view Judgment Day ?
As friends of God today , they are motivated to do their utmost in God’s service .
SHORTLY before his death , Jesus warned his disciples : “ Look ! Satan has demanded to have you men to sift you as wheat . ”
Then , they beat the stalks against a hard surface or used farm animals to pull a threshing sledge over the stalks to break them into pieces .
Next , the farmers tossed the mixture into the air .
When under test , we need to have the ability to “ distinguish both right and wrong ” and thus avoid being misled by Satan’s schemes .
THE first person to write a thrilling account of Jesus ’ life and ministry is Matthew ​ — a close associate of Jesus Christ and a onetime tax collector .
For example , the Sermon on the Mount is related early in the book , although Jesus delivered it about halfway through his ministry .
Jesus was here discussing the subject of love , and he told listeners to imitate God and be perfect , or complete , in their love .
7 : 16 ​ — What “ fruits ” mark the true religion ?
Not at all .
They do not represent the 12 tribes of spiritual Israel .

He uses “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life ” to tempt us .
Be conscious of your spiritual need .
Be peaceable .
What practical lessons are included in the Sermon on the Mount !
28 : 19 , 20 .
Getting the sense of Kingdom truths brings with it the responsibility of teaching others and sharing these treasures with them .
The first call to gather the bride class went out when Jesus and his followers began preaching in 29 C.E . , and it continued till 33 C.E .
Some who became proselytes of the Pharisees may formerly have been gross sinners .
By converting to the extremism of the Pharisees , however , they took a turn for the worse , possibly becoming more extreme than their condemned teachers .
His remorse was prompted by his being in a desperate state .
Our doing the divine will is what really counts with Jehovah .
For example , we should have a zealous share in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work . ​ — Matt .

‘ DOES God care about me ? ’
Drawing on the realities of pastoral life , Jesus said : “ If a certain man comes to have a hundred sheep and one of them gets strayed , will he not leave the ninety - nine upon the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying ?
Putting the frightened creature on his shoulder , he would carry it back to the safety and security of the flock . ​ — Luke 15 : 5 , 6 .
Applying the illustration , Jesus said that God does not want “ one of these little ones to perish . ”
The account at 1 Kings 7 : 26 refers to the sea as containing “ two thousand bath measures ” of water used by the priests , whereas the parallel account at 2 Chronicles 4 : 5 speaks of it as containing “ three thousand bath measures . ”
So 2 Chronicles 4 : 5 refers to the maximum capacity of the temple basin , what it could contain , whereas 1 Kings 7 : 26 states the quantity of water that was usually put into the temple basin .
In Jesus ’ day , every Jewish male over 20 years of age was required to pay a yearly temple tax of two drachmas , or a didrachma .
This was the equivalent of about two days ’ wages .
This coin was worth four drachmas , or the equivalent of the temple tax for two persons .

Keys to Family Happiness
So when Fernando left in the car with his brother’s girlfriend and our son , I was upset for several reasons .
IF A couple argue , does this mean that they no longer love each other ?
Most married couples want to treat each other in a loving and kind manner .
However , the Bible realistically notes that “ all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ”
What other factors might cause tension ?
A husband and a wife often have different communication styles .
Michiko’s dilemma is not unique .
Sometimes , the more one partner pursues the matter , the more the other tries to avoid it .
“ The squeezing of the nose is what brings forth blood , and the squeezing out of anger is what brings forth quarreling , ” states a wise proverb .
What starts out as a difference over how to balance the family budget ( “ we need to control credit - card spending ” ) may quickly mutate into an attack on each other’s character ( “ you are so irresponsible ” ) .
TRY THIS : The next time a dispute arises , ask yourself : ‘ What would it cost me to acknowledge my mate’s concerns ?
Your intention may be to help your mate see the problem in perspective .
Both wives and husbands need to know that the people whom they love understand and empathize with them .
He might do so by means of name - calling or negative comparisons .

TRY THIS : Make a list of the positive things that your mate has done for you and the good motives that could have prompted these actions .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ Love . . . does not keep account of the injury . ”
When mates display this kind of love for each other , they will enjoy a happy marriage .

Who was Mark ?
Peter’s release from prison occurred about ten years after Jesus was killed at Passover 33 C.E . ​ — Acts 12 : 1 - 5 , 11 - 17 .
So Jesus may have known Barnabas , as well as his aunt Mary and her son Mark . ​ — Acts 4 : 36 , 37 ; Colossians 4 : 10 .
In his Gospel , Mark wrote that on the night Jesus was arrested , a youth wearing only a garment “ over his naked body ” was present .
So when Jesus and his apostles left late that night , Mark apparently threw on a garment and followed . ​ — Mark 14 : 51 , 52 .
But he also accompanied his cousin Barnabas , who helped Saul by introducing him to Peter some three years after Jesus had appeared to Saul in a vision .
When returning from their missionary tour , Paul and Barnabas reported wonderful successes .
Tempers flared , and after “ a sharp burst of anger , ” Paul and Barnabas separated .
Barnabas took Mark along to preach in Cyprus , and Paul selected Silas and revisited the new disciples , as previously planned .
He likely had what he felt was a good reason .
This is also evident when we read Mark’s Gospel .
And when Paul was imprisoned there again , he wrote to Timothy and asked him to bring Mark , explaining : “ He is useful to me for ministering . ”

Our Readers Ask
Jesus called Satan “ the ruler of the world . ”
That position he will never relinquish .
Ever since his first contact with humans , Satan has been a murderer and a deceiver .
Satan wreaks havoc on human society in profound ways .
Jesus also said that the men seeking to kill him were children of the first murderer .
Like father , like son , the adage states .
J .
That death toll is in addition to the tens of millions killed on the battlefield during the same period .
If God does not cause suffering , why does he allow it ?
True , for now , Satan has the world in his evil grip .
But not for much longer .

What effect can Bible narratives have on us ?
Instead , such accounts can draw us closer to God . ​ — Jas .
All of us can learn much from the experiences of well - known Bible characters ​ — Abraham , Sarah , Moses , Ruth , David , Esther , the apostle Paul , and others .
A soldier usually wielded his sword with his right hand , leaving that side unprotected by the shield held in his left hand .
Yet , he was protected if a friend fought near him on his right .
We have proof of this in the case of Abraham’s oldest servant , likely Eliezer .
On one occasion , Persian King Artaxerxes noticed that his cupbearer Nehemiah was gloomy .
“ What is this that you are seeking to secure ? ”
Yet , God answered it , for Nehemiah was given the king’s support to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem .
( b ) What should be our attitude regarding prayer to God ?
Then “ quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all , and they fell upon Paul’s neck and tenderly kissed him , because they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they were going to behold his face no more . ”
Zelophehad’s daughters had faith that things would work out well if they obeyed God .
Some four decades later , Joshua and Caleb were still alive and following Jehovah fully , and God used Joshua to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land .
I was full when I went , and it is empty - handed that Jehovah has made me return . Why should you call me Naomi , when it is Jehovah that has humiliated me and the Almighty that has caused me calamity ? ” ​ — Ruth 1 : 20 , 21 .
Although Naomi was distressed , a careful reading of the book of Ruth shows that she kept on trusting in Jehovah .
He is the father of Jesse , David’s father . ” When Naomi is resurrected to life on earth , she will learn that Ruth , who will also be there , became an ancestress of Jesus , the Messiah .
If we keep Jehovah before us constantly , he will lead us by his holy spirit .
Jehovah’s holy spirit played an important role in the construction of the tabernacle in the wilderness .
Always Revere Jehovah of Armies
( Read Luke 2 : 25 - 38 . )
Regardless of our age , we need to keep Jehovah before us constantly .
What can we learn about such traits by examining further Bible accounts ?
How Would You Answer ?
• How do we know that Jehovah hears prayers ?
• Even if we are depressed , why should we always trust in Jehovah ?

Walk in Jehovah’s Ways
How is trustworthiness linked with our dedication to God ?
In the days of Israel’s Judges , Jephthah vowed that if Jehovah gave him victory over the Ammonites , he would present as “ a burnt offering ” the first one meeting him upon his return from battle .
That one turned out to be Jephthah’s daughter ​ — his only child .
11 : 28 - 40 .
Peninnah bore several children and taunted barren Hannah particularly when the family went to the tabernacle .
She soon became pregnant and gave birth to a boy who was given the name Samuel .
If we are trustworthy , we too will enjoy blessings in Jehovah’s service .
Why can we say that David and Jonathan were true friends ?
When Jonathan heard that David had killed Goliath , “ Jonathan’s very soul became bound up with the soul of David , and Jonathan began to love him as his own soul . ”
Jonathan even warned David when Saul wanted to kill him .
After David fled , Jonathan met him and made a covenant with him .
Always Be “ Humble in Mind ”
But the bramble ​ — useful only as fuel — ​ represented the kingship of proud Abimelech , a murderer eager to dominate others .
Though he ‘ played the prince over Israel three years , ’ he met an untimely death .
In the first century C.E . , tensions arose between proud King Herod Agrippa of Judea and the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon , who sought peace with him .
When Herod was giving a public address on one occasion , they cried out : “ A god’s voice , and not a man’s ! ”
Then let us credit God for what he allows us to do . ​ — 1 Cor .
Centuries later , a little Israelite girl taken captive by a marauding band became a servant in the home of the Syrian army commander Naaman , a man afflicted with leprosy .
Naaman did go to Israel , and he was miraculously healed .
The mob dragged Aristarchus and Gaius into the theater and kept shouting : “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
Prisca and Aquila were “ keeping an eye ” on the interests of others .
Today , concern for our persecuted brothers makes us “ cautious as serpents . ”
We carry on our work cautiously and refuse to betray them by divulging their names or other information to persecutors .

( b ) What can you do to be encouraging ?
Paul’s coworker Silas was a source of encouragement .

How grateful we should be for the true - life accounts recorded in the Word of Jehovah , the “ God of all encouragement ” !
• How can Bible accounts help us to be courageous ?

How did Dorcas fill the needs of fellow Christians ?

“ I am a representative from him , and that One sent me forth . ” ​ — JOHN 7 : 29 .
What is a missionary , and who can be called the greatest Missionary ?
The words “ missionary ” and “ missionaries ” do not appear in the main text of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
And what made his ministry successful ?
But we cannot even imagine the contrast between Jesus ’ circumstances on earth and those in heaven , where he lived with his Father among angelic creatures who served Jehovah with pure motives .
When it came to winsome words , however , no human ever spoke as Jesus did . ​ — Luke 4 : 22 .
Although Jesus did not inherit sin from Adam , He did become a human , like those who would later become his “ brothers , ” or anointed followers .
And because of his faithfulness to Jehovah while on earth , Jesus “ became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him . ”
Moreover , “ in that he himself has suffered when being put to the test , he is able to come to the aid of those [ like us ] who are being put to the test . ” ​ — Heb .
Regardless of what Jesus may have learned from his mother , Mary , and his adoptive father , Joseph , he received his principal training for the ministry from the highest Source .
Concerning this , Jesus said : “ I have not spoken out of my own impulse , but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak . ”
( b ) How did Jesus use the training he received ?
For example , consider Jehovah’s dealings with the wayward Israelites .
Working with and observing Jehovah , Jesus cultivated similar compassion for the people in his territory . ​ — John 5 : 19 .
Jesus put this training to work as he compassionately dealt with his disciples .
Spiritual Israel has successfully been founded on “ the apostles and prophets , ” and the foundation stones of the wall of New Jerusalem bear the names of the 12 faithful apostles of the Lamb , Jesus Christ .
To this day , anointed Christians along with their dedicated associates , the “ other sheep , ” flourish as a Kingdom - preaching organization under the mighty hand of God and the leadership of his beloved Son . ​ — Eph .
2 : 20 ; John 10 : 16 ; Rev .
How Jesus Taught
14 , 15 .
In contrast , what Jesus spoke was not of his own originality ; he stuck to God’s word , or message .
That is also what we need to do .
Regarding the scribes and Pharisees , he said : “ All the things they tell you , do and observe , but do not do according to their deeds , for they say but do not perform . ”
Why would you say that Jesus lived in harmony with his words recorded at Matthew 6 : 19 - 21 ?
Jesus pointed out how much better it is to store up treasures in heaven , “ where neither moth nor rust consumes , and where thieves do not break in and steal . ”
Qualities That Endeared Jesus to People
What qualities made Jesus an extraordinary evangelizer ?
Why can it be said that Jesus was humble ?
He did not have the attitude , ‘ I came all the way from the heavens , so you should listen to me . ’
( Read Mark 10 : 17 - 22 . )
To illustrate : On one occasion , Jesus and his apostles were so busy that they did not have time even to eat a meal .
Jesus noticed the pitiful condition of the people in his territory and expended himself in teaching them and performing miracles for their benefit .
• How was Jesus ’ way of teaching superior to that of the scribes and Pharisees ?
“ Become imitators of me , even as I am of Christ . ” ​ — 1 COR .
2 : 21 .
Even if you have not been appointed by the Governing Body as a missionary , what attitude can you have ?
Last year , 6,957,854 Kingdom publishers ‘ did the work of evangelizers ’ in 236 lands . ​ — 2 Tim .
3 , 4 .
But we can remain steadfast as his followers , not longingly looking back at what we had in Satan’s world . ​ — 1 John 5 : 19 .
Most of us did not have to leave all “ our own things ” behind so as to follow Jesus .
However , we did have to ‘ disown ourselves ’ to become followers of Christ and wholehearted servants of Jehovah .
Upon learning Bible truth , many immigrants willingly give up jobs in affluent countries and go back to their homeland with the objective of helping their relatives and others spiritually .
A number of Witnesses have been able to move to areas where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater .
What schools are available for training those who want to enhance their ability as Kingdom proclaimers ?
Today , there are schools especially designed to equip us as Kingdom proclaimers .
How much do some brothers value the training that Jehovah provides ?
“ In fact , if they had given me a leave of absence as a favor , they might have expected me to stay with the company permanently out of loyalty .
Consider what happened in the case of Saulo in Guatemala .
Unable to hold back her tears , she embraced Saulo .
All of us thus speak and think in agreement , and this contributes to our unity .
When 11 - year - old Keanu in Hawaii was reading this book in school , one of his classmates asked him , “ Why don’t you celebrate holidays ? ”
Keanu read the answer right from the appendix topic “ Should We Celebrate Holidays ? ”
The picture of an unborn child appearing in that chapter touched the couple so deeply that they decided against the abortion .
A Witness delivering newspapers found the briefcase .
We cannot perform miracles , but we can show love , humility , and compassion ​ — qualities that help to draw people to the truth .
“ Have you heard what God promises for people who are sick and elderly ? ” she asked .
Yes , he was severely crippled , but he is now baptized , takes the lead in caring for an isolated group , and is able to walk all over the island preaching the good news .
When some became Jesus ’ disciples in the first century , Peter asked : “ What actually will there be for us ? ”
How Would You Respond ?
• How can we imitate Jesus in our attitude toward people ?
They asked : “ When will these things be , and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things ? ”
What of the “ presence ” that the apostles asked about ?
This is the translation of the Greek word pa·rou·siʹa .
Many different things , including “ the last days ” of this wicked system of things , the gathering of the chosen ones , and their resurrection to heavenly life , occur during this presence of Jesus .
In a similar way , Christ’s presence includes the events leading up to and including the great tribulation . ​ — 2 Thess .
The account then shows that he is followed by riders seated on different - colored horses .
( Read Revelation 12 : 7 - 12 . )
However , this psalm also indicates that there is a period of time when earth’s rulers , along with their subjects , are given an opportunity to submit to Christ’s rule .
Yes , during that time “ happy are all those taking refuge in him [ God ] ” by serving Jehovah and his appointed King .
So , then , a window of opportunity is opened during Jesus ’ presence in kingly power . ​ — Ps .
2 : 10 - 12 .
Recognizing the Sign
( Read Luke 17 : 24 - 29 . )
It is true that when Jesus used the word “ generation ” negatively , he was speaking to or about the wicked people of his day .
Why can we say that the “ generation ” that Jesus referred to must have been his disciples ?
Unlike unbelievers , Jesus ’ disciples would not only see the sign but also understand its significance .
As challenging as it may be , we must prove ourselves ready and keep on the watch .
Understanding that Christ is present invisibly in Kingdom power helps us to do that .
It also alerts us to the fact that soon he will come to destroy his enemies “ at an hour that [ we ] do not think likely . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 40 .
Soon he will come to destroy the wicked and bring about vast changes to this entire globe .
[ Footnotes ]
• Why are we unable to calculate the exact length of “ this generation ” ?
For example , Exodus 1 : 6 tells us : “ Eventually Joseph died , and also all his brothers and all that generation . ”
Some of these outlived Joseph .
33 : 52 .
10 : 11 .
In taking possession of the Promised Land , the Israelites won early victories over its inhabitants .
However , the sons of Israel failed to obey God’s commands fully .
For the people of Israel , fraternizing with the inhabitants of the land led to intermarriage and idolatry .
Evidently , this transition went beyond the possible adoption of Canaanite farming methods .
Besides tilling the land and reaping its produce , in time the Israelites joined in honoring Canaanite gods as the givers of plenty .
They include money , entertainment personalities , sports figures , political systems , certain religious leaders , and even family members .
Any of these could potentially become our focus in life .
Hence , we need to ask ourselves : ‘ With whom do I associate while engaging in leisure activities ?
Will being in their company encourage me to be a better Christian ? ’
Happy are those observing his reminders ; with all the heart they keep searching for him . ”
Scriptural Questions Answered :
Righthearted people could then respond to his preaching work and take steps that would bring them God’s approval .
Jesus had been entreated to go away from that area , so he would have had very little or no contact with the people there .
The presence and the testimony of a man to whom Jesus had done a good deed could serve to counteract any negative talk about the loss of the swine . ​ — Mark 5 : 1 - 20 ; Luke 8 : 26 - 39 .
This foreshadowed the peaceful rest and other blessings that mankind will experience under the Thousand Year Reign of Christ after the end of Satan’s oppressive rulership .
Therefore , the King of that Kingdom is also “ Lord of the sabbath . ” ​ — Matt .
3 : 5 ; 7 : 34 ; 8 : 12 ​ — How could Mark have known details about Jesus ’ emotional state ?
Mark was neither one of the 12 apostles nor a close companion of Jesus .
Jesus might have done this out of consideration for the man .
The gradual restoration of sight to a man who had been accustomed to darkness for a long time may have allowed him to adjust to the brilliance of the sunlight .
We should take into consideration the background of our listeners when we engage in the Christian ministry or give talks at congregation meetings .
This teaches us to put spiritual interests first in our lives . ​ — Matt .
12 : 46 - 50 ; Luke 8 : 19 - 21 .
16 : 21 - 25 ; Luke 9 : 22 , 23 .

After some opening comments , he introduced the first speaker , Gary Breaux of the United States Branch Committee .
Brother Jackson , who served as a missionary for nearly 25 years in the South Pacific , discussed the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount .
In that discourse , Jesus spoke of two men , one discreet and the other foolish , who built houses .
Jesus explained that the foolish man resembled those who did no more than listen to Jesus ’ teachings .
Brother Jackson told the graduates , “ When you apply in the missionary field what you learned through Bible study , you will be like the discreet man . ”

How were they rescued ?
One by one , the miners were brought to the surface in that cage , out of their would - be tomb .
Today , some 3,500 years later , those words continue to prove true , for who of us can escape life’s fatal outcome ​ — death ?
Thus far , however , the combination of advanced science and sheer willpower has not extended human life much beyond the 70 or 80 years that Moses mentioned 3,500 years ago . ​ — Psalm 90 : 10 .
Yet , man’s Creator , Jehovah God , has organized just such a rescue .
Did You Know ?
By contrast , Jesus said that two sparrows sold “ for a coin of small value , ” the equivalent of 45 minutes ’ wages .
Jesus Christ valued the widow’s gift as being greater than that of all those who had donated more “ out of their surplus . ”
He was commissioned to declare the good news to non - Jews , and he might have felt that his Roman name would be more acceptable .

Vine , respected British scholar , offers these hard facts : “ By the middle of the 3rd cent . A.D . . . . pagans were received into the churches . . . and were permitted largely to retain their pagan signs and symbols .
Hence the Tau or T , . . . with the cross - piece lowered , was adopted . ” ​ — Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words .
Vine further notes that both the noun “ cross ” and the verb “ crucify ” refer to “ a stake or pale . . . distinguished from the ecclesiastical form of a two beamed cross . ”

A Letter From the Dominican Republic
I was happy too .
It was two years ago .
After a half - hour drive over dusty country roads , I got my first glimpse of her .
She was sitting on the porch of a modest country home ​ — a wood and cinder - block structure with a rusted tin roof .
Goats , rabbits , and dogs added to the sounds and smells .
She looked much older than her 34 years .
When I placed a Bible in her hands , she recognized it and said that she had enjoyed reading the Scriptures before losing her sight .

What do the Scriptures say about being yielding , and why is this fitting ?
JEHOVAH , our loving heavenly Father , is infinitely wise .
3 : 17 .
What could prompt a slave to do this ?
Neither our speech nor our actions should stumble others .
Indeed , love will impel us to avoid doing anything that might hinder people of different backgrounds and cultures from progressing toward serving Jehovah .
For example , missionary sisters accustomed to wearing cosmetics or nylons do not insist on using them in localities where that might call their morals into question and stumble others . ​ — 1 Cor .
After a dispute among the disciples as to who was the greatest , Jesus stood a young child in their midst .
Individually , we may find it a real challenge to conduct ourselves as “ a lesser one . ”
To be yielding , what must we take into account ?
Our yielding to Jehovah’s authority demonstrates what ?
He is aware of all that happens and can reward us accordingly .
Paul punctuated that advice with this directive : “ Do not avenge yourselves , beloved , but yield place to the wrath ; for it is written : ‘ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , says Jehovah . ’ ” ​ — Rom .
Divinely constituted authority is also a factor within the Christian congregation .
All in the congregation submit to the arrangement that Jesus made for “ the faithful and discreet slave ” to provide spiritual food at the proper time .
Yield ​ — To What Extent ?
In his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus pointed out the need to yield to authority : “ If a person wants to go to court with you and get possession of your inner garment , let your outer garment also go to him ; and if someone under authority impresses you into service for a mile , go with him two miles . ”
* Consideration for others and a desire to help them also move us to go the extra mile , so to speak . ​ — 1 Cor .
13 : 5 ; Titus 3 : 1 , 2 .
During a discussion , an individual’s view may change as he hears others direct attention to Scriptural principles that apply .
That spirit ought to carry over even in his shepherding of the flock , helping him to show consideration and gentleness to others .

Elderly members of the congregation appreciate the valuable help of those younger in years and treat them with dignity .
Being Yielding as Family Members
19 , 20 . ( a ) Contrast the example of Eli and that of Jehovah in being yielding . ( b ) What lessons can parents learn from these examples ?
When Samuel was just a boy , Eli served as high priest in Israel .
Finally , Jehovah justly determined that they merited the penalty of death .
Jehovah asked which of the angels could fool King Ahab of Israel to bring about the downfall of the wicked king .
Our next article will consider how being yielding in a balanced way contributes to finding joy in marriage .
So the word has the sense of being yielding and reasonable , not insisting on carrying out the letter of the law or demanding one’s rights .
• What good fruitage can being yielding produce ?
When congregation elders meet , prayerful reflection and a yielding spirit promote unity
For example , God recognized that for His purpose to be accomplished , it was “ not good for the man to continue by himself ” in the garden of Eden .
When Jehovah brought this perfect woman , Eve , to Adam , the man said : “ This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh . This one will be called Woman , because from man this one was taken . ”
Eve was truly a complement of Adam .
Adam and Eve had no trouble accepting this divine arrangement that would provide mutual help and support . ​ — Gen .
Sadly , a rebellious spirit permeates the world today .
Many parents refuse to yield , even for the sake of peace and unity .
( a ) What direction did Paul give about marriage ?
“ For [ a non - Israelite ] will turn your son from following me , and they will certainly serve other gods ; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you , and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry . ”
Plainly , a servant of God should choose as a marriage mate one who is “ in the Lord , ” a dedicated , baptized fellow worshipper .
Consider the case of Jephthah , who served as judge in Israel in the 12th century B.C.E .
Jephthah kept his promise to Jehovah , even though this meant that he would have no descendant to carry on his name .
The more time they spent together , the closer they became .
Another husband , now married for 30 years , realized early in his marriage that to be balanced , he had to “ think plural . ”
Sometimes marriage unites two people who are from different cultural backgrounds .
Discernment is vital for happiness . ​ — Read Proverbs 24 : 3 .
When it comes to choosing hobbies and recreation , many have found it important to be flexible .
How will being yielding contribute to good relations between parents and married children ?
( Read Genesis 2 : 24 . )
One husband , married for 25 years , notes : “ At times , it is difficult to balance the various wishes and needs of one’s mate with those of one’s parents , siblings , and in - laws .
One family head acknowledges : “ If we could go back and change anything , it would be to make sure that we stuck to a good routine of family study from the start of our marriage . ”
6 : 18 .
Be Yielding Within the Marriage
The wife does not exercise authority over her own body , but her husband does ; likewise , also , the husband does not exercise authority over his own body , but his wife does . ”
Why ?
In mentioning prayer , Paul shows the priorities for a Christian .
Husband and wife need to be open with each other and realize that a lack of tenderness in intimate relations can lead to problems .
Love for Jehovah and for one’s mate , combined with a yielding spirit , will help in this aspect of marriage .
Respect plays what part in a happy marriage ?
How can couples apply Ephesians 4 : 26 , 27 in their marriage ?
“ Be wrathful , and yet do not sin ; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state , neither allow place for the Devil . ”
“ I don’t remember ever having a disagreement and not talking it over with my husband even if this meant spending hours resolving the matter , ” recalls one sister .
At the start of their marriage , she and her husband determined that they would not end the day without solving their differences .
“ We decided , no matter what the problem was , to forgive and forget and give each day a fresh start . ”
But what if you entered into a marriage arrangement unwisely ?
Under inspiration , Paul counseled Christians : “ Let marriage be honorable among all , and the marriage bed be without defilement , for God will judge fornicators and adulterers . ”
When both husband and wife are deeply concerned with the sanctification of Jehovah’s name , they are bonded to each other and bonded to God .
It certainly is possible for Christians to find joy in marriage .
To do so takes effort and the displaying of Christian qualities , one of which is being yielding .
[ Picture on page 9 ]
If so , you are not alone .
They feel very much as did the psalmist David , who wrote : “ I have grown numb and become crushed to an extreme degree ; I have roared due to the groaning of my heart .
The original - language word rendered “ pangs of distress ” refers to the intense pain experienced during childbirth .
Of what are God’s people keenly aware ?
Notice his further words in that psalm : “ Jehovah is listening to the poor ones , and he will indeed not despise his very own prisoners , ” or “ those of his who are prisoners . ”
It may appear that others do not truly understand our situation ​ — and perhaps they do not .
How would God react to the prayers of these distressed individuals ?
Why ?
We can likewise approach Jehovah in prayer concerning ‘ our own plague and our own pain , ’ our individual distresses .
We should be comforted in knowing that he understands our distresses and that he cares about us .
The apostle Peter confirmed this when he said : “ Throw all your anxiety upon him , because he cares for you . ”
Jesus emphasized Jehovah’s loving care , saying : “ Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value ?
Consider what 1 Corinthians 10 : 13 says : “ God is faithful , and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear , but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it . ”
Either way , we are helped .
We try to stop worrying and patiently trust in him to care for our needs .
By humbling ourselves “ under the mighty hand of God , ” we acknowledge our lowly position .
What must we do when facing distresses ?
It is imperative that we , like David , approach Jehovah in prayer concerning whatever distresses we may be experiencing .
( Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 . )
Nevertheless , prayer helps us to keep our mental balance , so that our distresses do not overwhelm us .
Like a garrison of soldiers assigned to protect a city from hostile invasion , “ the peace of God ” will protect our hearts and our mental powers .
Consider an illustration that in some respects matches our situation .
How comforting that is !
We need to act in harmony with our prayers .
In a similar way , we can pray for practical wisdom to help us deal with and perhaps improve our distressing circumstances . ​ — Jas .

They may even continue for some time .
What examples can strengthen us ?
Second , keep in mind that “ the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of your brothers in the world . ”
Yes , “ no temptation has taken you except what is common to men . ”
Have you searched for life experiences that have been published , looking for accounts of those who have gone through something similar to what you face ?
How can the Bible help us deal with life’s distresses ?
This word could have been used in ancient times of a boat that was fitted out with everything needed for a voyage or of a machine that was capable of performing whatever was expected of it .
Deliverance From All Our Distresses
Focusing on what will further assist us to endure faithfully ?
Can You Answer ?
• What confidence did King Solomon express ?
Another reason was that I could share my faith with my beloved son and daughter .
When Lucía was four , she began to have severe stomach pains .
The doctor explained that Lucía had a neuroblastoma , an aggressive , cancerous tumor .
The way she coped with the disease also impressed the hospital staff .
The nurses even gave Lucía a white coat and a lapel badge identifying her as a “ nurse’s assistant . ”
She was expressive and mature , very mature . ”
Lucía’s firm hope in the resurrection helped her to maintain her composure and cheerfulness despite a grim prognosis .
It was on that day that I made the very important appointment .
“ Just breathe slowly .
I know that the waiting period will not be easy .
The day Lucía died , he told me that he had to sort out his thoughts .
A few weeks later , he asked an elder in the congregation for a Bible study .
Soon my husband began to attend all the meetings .
On a rainy Saturday morning , a lady whose son went to the same school that Lucía had attended came to our home .
When she learned what had happened to Lucía , the lady found out where we lived and came to visit us .
Her faith has helped to unite our family in serving God , and it has increased my determination likewise to remain firm in the faith .
The answer centered on our desire to act on Jesus ’ command to preach the good news “ to the most distant part of the earth . ”
We were on a preaching trip to an isolated territory in the Bolivian Andes .
We learned that public transport to such remote places did not run on a precise schedule .
No matter how far we walked , there always seemed to be another house in the distance .
We were too tired to move , and thankfully , before long the ants seemed to ignore our presence .
After washing in the stream , we considered a Bible text together , had breakfast , and started slowly uphill to other distant villages .
The climb was well worth the effort .
He was amazed that we had come all the way from La Paz .
Many of the people found at home put down sheepskins for us to sit on and called the family together to listen .
Some farmers contributed large bags of maize out of gratitude for the Bible literature we left with them .
Eventually , we arrived in the dark .
In time , we were able to get a ride in the back of a truck crammed with people .
Though reserved by nature , the people are generally warm and friendly .
We could not help but think of the words : “ How comely upon the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news , the one publishing peace , the one bringing good news of something better , the one publishing salvation . ” ​ — Isa .
Ready to share the good news
What can be said about many who are considered wise ?
Your view of who is wise may be influenced by your background and circumstances .
As to some who rejected the knowledge of God , the apostle Paul wrote : “ Although asserting they were wise , they became foolish . ”
And through the prophet Isaiah , Jehovah himself said pointedly : “ Woe to those wise in their own eyes . ” ​ — Isa .
Proverbs 9 : 10 offers us this insight : “ The fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom , and the knowledge of the Most Holy One is what understanding is . ”
The wise must have a proper fear of God and a respect for his standards .
What actions will reveal that we possess such wisdom ?
We are not born with godly wisdom .
Jehovah’s ways are vastly superior to those of humans .
2 : 5 - 8 .
He had great responsibility , yet he is described as “ by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground . ”
What effort is needed for us to display godly mildness , and why ?
Likewise , the Bible counsels us : “ An answer , when mild , turns away rage , but a word causing pain makes anger to come up . ”
( Read James 3 : 14 . )
How will he view that ?
Why do you feel that the inspired counsel of James 3 : 15 , 16 is so important ?
( Read James 3 : 15 , 16 . )
They are “ animal ” in that they are the product of fleshly inclinations , similar to characteristics of unreasoning creatures .
How unfitting for a Christian to display those characteristics !
Perhaps you have had a doctor use a reflex hammer to tap the tendon just below your kneecap .
It is automatic ; you do not have to think about it .
Our chasteness and Bible - trained conscience should reflexively move us to reject what is bad .
The Bible provides examples of those who reacted in this way , such as Joseph and Jesus . ​ — Gen .
39 : 7 - 9 ; Matt .
Divine wisdom requires that we also be peaceable .
In the congregation , are we known as peacemakers or as peacebreakers ?
Can You Explain ?
12 : 25 .
How did you feel when you first entered the spiritual paradise ?
( a ) What may affect our view of others ?
If this happens to us , it is time to give attention to our view and bring it into line with Jehovah’s clear view . ​ — Ex .
As recorded at 1 Corinthians 12 : 2 - 26 , the apostle Paul compared the congregation of anointed Christians to a body with “ many members . ”
If we have that tendency , we ought to work hard to change , so that we are not adversely judged .
Really , who are we to judge someone whom Jehovah is using in an appointed position or to say that he should not be part of the congregation ?
A brother may have some shortcomings , but if Jehovah continues to accept him , would it be proper for us to reject him ?
He also knows what spiritual progress they have already made .

Jehovah can read hearts , while we cannot .
We do not know all of another person’s motives .
Thereafter , passersby comment on what a delightful home it is .
Rather than focusing on our brothers ’ surface defects , can we discern their good qualities and their potential for further spiritual growth ?
In recent times , global developments have resulted in vast movements of people .
Some of the people new to our area have become interested in Bible truth , and they have joined us in worshipping Jehovah .
That calls for bearing in mind the apostle Peter’s counsel to manifest “ unhypocritical brotherly affection ” and to “ love one another intensely from the heart . ”
Nonetheless , all of us are instructed : “ Have love for the whole association of brothers . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
Such feelings may reveal the need for us to rid ourselves of prejudice that we still harbor deep down .
The Bible gives us fine examples of those who did adjust , one of whom was the apostle Peter .
As a Jew , Peter would have avoided entering a Gentile’s home .
If we find that there are hidden traces of prejudice in us , let us work to root them out and to “ observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace . ”
Imitating Jehovah in Our Ministry
Jesus said : “ The field is the world . ”
What significance does that have for you and your immediate family ?
19 , 20 .
All lives are precious in God’s eyes , and we want to view things in the same way . ​ — Col .
If certain individuals treat us unkindly , that should not cause us to form negative opinions about their nationality or ethnic group as a whole .
Paul was treated badly by some , but he did not allow that to cause him to give up preaching to people of that background .
• How can we imitate Jehovah’s view of people when we are in the ministry ?
EARLY MINISTRY
Jesus sets out on his first preaching tour of Galilee .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
For Mary’s child to be a true descendant of her ancestors Abraham , Judah , and David , as God had promised , her ovum had to contribute toward her pregnancy .
No .
The fact that only his speech needed to be restored indicates that Zechariah’s hearing had not been affected . ​ — Luke 1 : 13 , 18 - 20 , 60 - 64 .
This refers to the distress Mary would experience upon seeing the majority of the people reject Jesus as the Messiah and the grief she would feel over his painful death . ​ — John 19 : 25 .
1 : 32 , 33 ; 2 : 19 , 51 .
24 : 3 .
2 : 41 - 50 .
A teacher of God’s Word must set a proper example for his students .
8 : 15 .
JESUS ’ LATER MINISTRY
Jesus sends forth 70 others in advance of him into cities and places in Judea .
Jesus was not stating that Satan had already been ousted from heaven .
“ The body ” they gather to is the true Christ at his invisible presence and the spiritual food that Jehovah provides for them . ​ — Matt .
11 : 1 - 4 .
Although Jehovah is willing to answer our prayers , we should be persistent when praying . ​ — 1 John 5 : 14 .
Genuine happiness comes from faithfully doing God’s will and not from family relationships or material accomplishments .
Our gifts of mercy should stem from a loving and willing heart .
We are wise to live within our means .
Although the word “ Armageddon ” has in recent years been used to signify a worldwide nuclear conflagration , one dictionary describes the principal meaning of the word this way : “ The place of a great and final conflict between the forces of good and evil . ”
“ As for the wicked , they will be no longer . ” “ The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth , and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it , ” says the book of Proverbs .
The Bible also makes clear that the wicked will not relinquish their power peacefully ; hence the need for a conclusive act of God that eliminates all evil , including the evil of war .
“ Throughout history , Megiddo and the Jezreel Valley have been ground zero for battles that determined the very course of civilization , ” writes historian Eric H .
Cline in The Battles of Armageddon .
Mongol armies , which overran much of Asia in the 13th century , suffered their first defeat in this valley .
Not far from Megiddo , British forces under General Edmund Allenby defeated the Turks during the first world war .
One historian counted at least 34 !
Megiddo’s history and its strategic location doubtless have a bearing on the figurative use of the word “ Armageddon . ”
Although that word occurs only once in the Bible , its setting in the book of Revelation makes it very clear that Armageddon will touch the lives of everyone on earth .
Although many past wars fought near Megiddo proved decisive , none eliminated wickedness .
Furthermore , the Bible specifically refers to Armageddon as God’s war .
This horseman is identified as none other than Jesus Christ . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 14 , 15 ; Revelation 19 : 11 , 12 , 16 .
Why would Jehovah and his Son , Jesus Christ , fight such a war ?
For one thing , Armageddon will “ bring to ruin those ruining the earth . ”
Why Is Armageddon Necessary ?
The book of Psalms describes Jesus as a mounted warrior .
Christ rides , the psalmist explains , “ in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness . ”
He wages war because he loves righteousness and hates wickedness . ​ — Psalm 45 : 4 , 7 .
He will clothe himself with the strong desire to set things right and to punish and avenge the wrongs that people suffer . ” ​ — Isaiah 59 : 15 , 17 , Today’s English Version .
“ Is the Judge of all the earth not going to do what is right ? ” asked Abraham .
Furthermore , the Bible assures us that Jehovah finds no delight in destroying the wicked ; he does so only as a last resort . ​ — Ezekiel 18 : 32 ; 2 Peter 3 : 9 .
Taking Armageddon Seriously
But how can we be sure ?
“ Seek righteousness , seek meekness , ” urges the prophet Zephaniah .
The will of God is that “ all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth , ” says the apostle Paul . ​ — 1 Timothy 2 : 4 .
Learning the truth about Jehovah and his purpose to rid the earth of wickedness is a first step toward salvation .
“ Never again will they learn war . ” ​ — Isaiah 2 : 4 , New American Standard Bible .
Learning the truth about Jehovah and his purpose is a first step toward salvation
“ OUR hearts may condemn us . ”
Indeed , it may insist that we are unworthy of God’s love and care .
Yet , the Bible reassures us : “ God is greater than our hearts and knows all things . ”
Yet not one of them goes forgotten before God . . . .
Sparrows were among the cheapest of all birds used for food .
Jehovah notices each time a sparrow falls to the earth perhaps because it is injured or alights on the ground in search of food .
The seemingly insignificant birds that were not too little for Jehovah to create are not too little for him to remember .
Of how much more worth are you than birds ? ”
In light of Jesus ’ words , we need not feel that we are too unworthy to be noticed and cared for by the God who “ is greater than our hearts . ”

Imitate Their Faith
ELIJAH longed to be alone with his heavenly Father .
The day that was now drawing to a close had revealed much about the character of both men .
It had been a bad day for Ahab and other Baal worshippers .
For over three years , the Baal prophets had implored their god to end the drought afflicting the land , but Baal had proved unable to do so .
How would Elijah conduct himself until then ?
Let us see as we examine the account recorded at 1 Kings 18 : 41 - 46 .
Elijah’s example teaches us much about prayer .
His heart was likely full of thanksgiving after the miracle he had seen Jehovah perform that day .
Look in the direction of the sea . ’
So he went up and looked and then said : ‘ There is nothing at all . ’
And he went on to say , ‘ Go back , ’ for seven times . ”
Elijah’s example teaches us at least two lessons .
Upon his return , the attendant delivered this unenthusiastic report : “ There is nothing at all . ”
The horizon was clear , and the sky , evidently cloudless .
Next , notice how watchful Elijah was .
He now gave his attendant urgent directions : “ Go up , say to Ahab , ‘ Hitch up ! And go down that the downpour may not detain you ! ’ ”
We too live at a time when God will soon act to fulfill his stated purpose .
Elijah awaited the end of a drought ; God’s servants today await the end of a corrupt world system of things .
Until Jehovah God acts , we need to remain watchful , as Elijah was .
*
* The parched ground drank in the drops .
Surely Elijah hoped that it would be so !
Jehovah’s prophet began to make his way along the same road Ahab had taken .
A long , dark , wet trek lay ahead of him .
“ The very hand of Jehovah proved to be upon Elijah , so that he girded up his hips and went running ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel . ”
As Elijah raced along that wet road , he surely knew that he had the approval of his Father , the only true God , Jehovah !
For more information on the evidence that Jesus ’ words are undergoing fulfillment today , see chapter 9 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Elisha acted as Elijah’s attendant , evidently offering practical assistance to an older man .
The full “ three years and six months ” had elapsed by the time all the people assembled to witness the great test on Mount Carmel .

Jesus then touched the man’s eyes again , with this result : “ The man saw clearly , and he was restored , and he was seeing everything distinctly . ”
Beginning to see for the first time after being blind for years ​ — or even for life — ​ is a major adjustment .
However , the patients have often been overwhelmed by the flood of information coming from their eyes to the brain .
In Jesus ’ day , why was reading from a scroll quite an undertaking ?
In some cases , longer sheets were used .
With regard to this account , Alan Millard says in his book Discoveries From the Time of Jesus : “ The reader held the book [ scroll ] and unrolled it with his left hand , taking the outer edge in his right and rolling it again as he read , column by column .
To reach Isaiah 61 , the chapter he read in the synagogue , Jesus would have unrolled most of the scroll and re - rolled it again . ”

What are some of our valuable things , and what is the best way to use them ?
They might include a measure of health and strength , inborn mental abilities , or financial resources .
3 : 9 .
Then we see that a Christian who diligently and faithfully serves Jehovah enjoys real security .
How can we avoid that ?
Among these are false gods .
16 : 25 , 26 .
As David indicated , we are surrounded by evidence of Jehovah’s greatness .
What a privilege it was for the Israelites to be in a covenant relationship with Jehovah !
10 : 14 , 15 ; Isa .
46 : 5 - 7 .
In many lands today , people still bow down to man - made images , and such gods are just as useless now as they were in the past .
We need it just to survive , and we can use it well in Jehovah’s service .
Yet , many who pursue such education end up with their minds filled with harmful propaganda .
Rather than looking to the advanced educational systems of this world for security , a Christian trusts in Jehovah . ​ — Prov .
Do Not Let Fleshly Desire Become a God
3 : 23 , 24 .
Covetousness is a strong desire for something we do not possess .
Jesus used a vivid word picture to show how important it is to control such wrong desires at any cost . ​ — Read Mark 9 : 47 ; 1 John 2 : 16 .
Yes , Moses ’ words were inspired by God .
Thus , they were valuable , indeed vital , for the well - being of the nation .
Those who heeded them enjoyed long life and prosperity .
May we always repudiate valueless words and cling to valuable words of truth .
Of course not !
However , apostates speak their own wisdom , and their words are valueless , a stumbling block to any who might listen .
How can we avoid being misled by them ?
If any statements come to our ears that are critical of the truth or that cast aspersions on the congregation , the elders , or any of our brothers , we do not accept them at face value .
Rather , we ask : “ Is the one spreading this story acting in harmony with what the Bible says ?
Anything we hear that tears down the brotherhood rather than builds it up is a worthless thing . ​ — 2 Cor .
13 : 10 , 11 .
When we do so , we in effect say with the psalmist : “ Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless ; preserve me alive in your own way . ”
• In a general sense , what “ valueless things ” should we repudiate ?
12 : 1 .
JEHOVAH views Christian youths as precious and as refreshing as dewdrops .
What confidence he has in you young brothers and sisters !
Remembering Jehovah involves what ?
Naturally , remembering Jehovah involves more than merely calling him to mind .
Shortly after his baptism , Jesus was approached by Satan , who tried to tempt him to accept worldly power and glory .
Today’s world is ruled by greed and selfishness .
Instead , be resolved to remember your Grand Creator .
( Read Psalm 119 : 99 , 100 . )
Sadly , some young servants of God have let their guard down and have allowed themselves to lose sight of how short a time this world has .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What strategy did Satan use on the Plains of Moab ?
The people started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Moab and to bow down to the Baal of Peor !
Today , we are rapidly nearing a much better promised land ​ — the new system of things .
True to form , Satan is again using sexual immorality to corrupt God’s people .
Moral standards in the world have fallen so low that fornication is considered normal and homosexuality is viewed simply as a matter of personal choice .
Pray earnestly to Jehovah for help to focus on wholesome things .
What negative state of mind do we want to avoid , and what questions can we ask ourselves ?
They are like the godless Israelites of Isaiah’s day who lived for “ exultation and rejoicing , . . . the eating of flesh and the drinking of wine . ”
Your answer will influence the goals and priorities that you set for yourself .
Why should young Christians who are still in school work hard ?
Young ones receive advice from all kinds of people ​ — including school guidance counselors , who usually think purely in terms of success in the secular world .
3 : 1 - 6 .
After all , they want you to gain life , something far more valuable than wealth or prestige in this world . ​ — Matt .
( b ) What important lesson do we learn from the experience of Baruch ?
Because this wholesome attitude runs contrary to the thinking of the world , we must be careful not to let the world’s spirit influence us .
It may be that Baruch wanted to make a better life for himself materially .
Jehovah noted this and kindly warned Baruch not to keep seeking “ great things ” for himself .
Baruch’s experience helps us to see that a good relationship with God is much more important than wealth and prominence in this world .
Jesus , for example , was the most gifted human who ever lived , yet he focused on that which would help people forever ​ — “ the good news of the kingdom . ”
Timothy , “ a genuine child in the faith , ” imitated Paul’s fine example .

Marriage and Parenthood in This Time of the End
The Bible also warned that this decisive period in human history would be a period of great social changes .
Why are such changes of concern to us ?
Because they are so extensive and so powerful that they could influence how Christians today view marriage and parenthood .
Nowadays , divorce has become easy and widespread , and the divorce rate in many countries is climbing .
Jehovah God expects those who are married to remain faithful to their marriage vow .
In fact , God’s Word states that Jehovah hates a divorce that has no Scriptural basis .
Responsible Marriage
Why do some young Christians regret that they rushed into marriage ?
The ungodly world in which we live is obsessed with sex .
How should young Christians react to this unwholesome influence , which can arouse sexual desire even against their will ?
In that way , they hope to avoid getting involved in sexual immorality .
Why ?
How should young Christians view the prospect of marriage ?
Are you young and still unmarried ?
What do some young couples experience , and why can this strain the marriage ?
When the newborn quite naturally becomes the primary object of the mother’s attention , the young husband may feel jealous .
This could have a debilitating effect on her spiritual health .
3 : 14 , 15 .
Single or Childless for a Noble Purpose
In fact , those who served as full - time ministers for some time while single and then later decided to marry often feel that their marriage is still benefiting from the valuable lessons they learned during those early years .
Some do so for economic reasons ; others do it because they want to be free to pursue a lucrative career .
However , they often do so to be freer to serve Jehovah .
This does not mean that such couples do not enjoy a normal married life .
Rearing children is a serious challenge for Christian parents .
17 : 25 .
In that way , our life ​ — whether we are single or married , with or without children — ​ will bring honor and praise to Jehovah and to the Christian congregation .
Those dealing with marital problems will be strengthened by reviewing such articles on marriage as found in The Watchtower of September 15 , 2003 , and Awake !
of January 8 , 2001 .
By Way of Review
Why is it wise for young Christians to wait to marry ?
Why do some Christian couples decide not to have children ?
There is much we can learn from Solomon’s experience .
Sometimes Solomon uses the word “ vanity ” as a parallel of “ striving after wind . ”
First , we will consider the pursuit of pleasure and possessions .
Where did Solomon search for satisfaction ?
Like many people today , Solomon tried to find satisfaction by pursuing a life of pleasure .
Not at all .
( Compare Mark 6 : 31 . )
Furthermore , not all kinds of recreation are wholesome .
As we listen to the funeral discourse and reflect on the life course of the faithful servant of Jehovah who has died , we might be moved to examine our own life course .
Solomon was one of the richest men on earth when he wrote Ecclesiastes .
A long time ago , Solomon had already reached that same conclusion .
everything was vanity and a striving after wind . ”
Solomon likewise appreciated the value of meaningful work . ​ — Eccl .
Sometimes the workplace itself is a source of frustration and even the scene of injustice .
As Solomon points out , the lazy one ​ — perhaps because he uses his connections with people in power — ​ may reap the reward of the diligent worker .
Other factors may also lead to disappointment .
That is priceless . ”
Miguel likewise says that preaching the Kingdom message brings him far more satisfaction than his secular work .
“ Send Out Your Bread ”
All these endeavors have permanent value and bring blessings to those who achieve them .
The Bible urges us to make wise decisions while we are still young regarding how we will use our life .
Nothing illustrates this better than the life of Jesus .
During his brief time on earth , Jesus provided the perfect example ​ — one that we strive to imitate — ​ of a truly worthwhile life . ​ — 1 Cor .
Every day , we can find ways to do things that are good in Jehovah’s eyes and that will enrich our lives .
For example , we can share the good news with others , strengthen our marriage and our family , and deepen our spirituality by personal study and meeting attendance .
If so , keep on following Solomon’s counsel : “ Fear the true God and keep his commandments .
• What kind of work will bring lasting satisfaction ?
Today , we still follow that inspired direction and look for ways to do good to our fellow believers .
True , in some lands , it is customary for families to look after elderly parents at home .
What challenges do they face ?
How can the Christian congregation help them ?
Challenges Faced in Nursing Homes
When elderly Christians move into a nursing home , they may find themselves in the territory of a congregation with which they are not familiar .
As a result , the local Witnesses may not think about visiting them frequently .
Moreover , in the nursing home , they will likely be surrounded by people who have different beliefs .
One caregiver observed : “ Some elderly Witnesses who are unable to communicate clearly have been taken in wheelchairs to church services without being consulted about their wishes . ”
Further , the staff of nursing homes often use birthdays , Christmas , or Easter to vary the routine of the residents .
If we visit our elderly brothers and sisters regularly , we will be able to help them deal with such challenges .
* Robert , an elder , points out : “ It would be good if Christian overseers personally visited the elderly to see their living conditions and to pray with them .
When necessary , the elders willingly coordinate practical assistance for their brothers and sisters in local nursing homes .
Jacqueline , who is in her mid - 80 ’ s and suffers from osteoarthritis , listens to the meetings by telephone .
She says : “ It does me a lot of good to hear the meetings while they are actually taking place .
I would not miss them for anything in the world ! ”
“ Sharing news regarding members of the local congregation with the elderly brothers and sisters makes them feel that they are still part of our spiritual family , ” says one overseer .
Maintain Communication
What can we do if he struggles to find the right words ?
Listen patiently , and if appropriate , mention two or three words that he seems to be groping for , or sum up his thoughts and encourage him to continue .
Laurence , a pioneer , regularly visits Madeleine , an 80 - year - old Christian sister who is no longer able to speak .
Robert , quoted above , states : “ Nursing staff are more likely to listen to someone who visits a resident regularly .
In some areas , a chronic shortage of qualified personnel reduces the quality of care the elderly receive .
We should not hesitate to ask the staff for suggestions on how we can assist .
Similar initiatives can make a big difference for those living in a nursing home . ​ — Prov .
Laurence admits : “ At first , Madeleine’s weakened condition affected me so much that I cried after each visit .
But when we pray together , I can still feel his faith . ”
Therefore , all of us should view care for the elderly , even over extended periods , as part of our ministering to one another .
Highlights From the Book of John
Many put faith in Jesus when they see a man who has been dead for four days come to life .
2 : 20 ​ — Which temple “ was built in forty - six years ” ?
The temple sanctuary and other main structures were constructed in eight years .
The man could become guilty of committing an unforgivable sin , deserving of death with no resurrection . ​ — Matt .
12 : 31 , 32 ; Luke 12 : 10 ; Heb .
5 : 26 ; 6 : 53 ​ — What does it mean to have ‘ life in oneself ’ ?
For Jesus Christ , this means receiving from God two specific capabilities ​ — the ability to give humans a fine standing with Jehovah and the power to impart life by resurrecting the dead .
6 : 64 ​ — Did Jesus know from the time of selecting Judas Iscariot that Judas would betray him ?
On one occasion in the year 32 C.E . , however , Jesus told his apostles : “ One of you is a slanderer . ”
Possibly , at that point Jesus noticed in Judas Iscariot a “ beginning , ” or start , of a wrong course . ​ — John 6 : 66 - 71 .
Happy we are when we do this . ​ — Matt .
( John 11 : 55 – 21 : 25 )
As the Passover of 33 C.E . nears , Jesus returns to Bethany .
On Nisan 10 , Jesus comes to the temple again .
As the Passover meal is in progress , Jesus gives his followers parting counsel and prays in their behalf .
Following his arrest , trial , and impalement , Jesus is resurrected .
14 : 2 ​ — How would Jesus “ prepare a place ” in heaven for his faithful followers ?
9 : 12 , 24 - 28 ; 1 Pet .
To become “ sons of light , ” or light bearers , we need to gain accurate knowledge of God’s Word , the Bible .
Then we must use that knowledge to draw others out of spiritual darkness into God’s light .
14 : 6 .
14 : 15 , 21 , 23 , 24 ; 15 : 10 .
Jehovah’s holy spirit serves as a teacher and remembrancer .
Peter was asked if he loved Jesus more than “ these , ” that is , the fish that were before them .
Yes , let us wholeheartedly continue following him .
Well , see if you can answer the following questions :
She was well - off but was not happy .
• In line with James 3 : 17 , what qualities should we display ?
Am I easily offended , or do I often offend others ?
( Mark 8 : 22 - 26 )
It is , however , possible that in this instance , by healing the blind man gradually , Jesus allowed him time to adapt to the new sensation of being able to see .
Keys to Family Happiness
He says : [ Annoyed and with a raised voice ] “ What do you mean ‘ buying new clothes ’ ?
She says : [ Defensively , feeling hurt and accused ] “ But there was a sale .
Rather , choose a time when you are both likely to be less stressed .
If you are married , your closest neighbor is your spouse .
Remember , your goal when discussing a problem is , not to win a battle or conquer an enemy , but simply to let your mate know your thoughts .
Do not presume that you know what your partner is thinking or feeling .
“ By presumptuousness one only causes a struggle , but with those consulting together there is wisdom , ” states God’s Word .
Take turns in this style of conversation until you both agree that you understand each other’s thoughts and feelings on the matter .
True , it requires humility and patience to listen attentively to your spouse and to acknowledge his or her opinion .
But if you take the lead in showing your mate such honor , your mate will be more inclined to honor you . ​ — Matthew 7 : 2 ; Romans 12 : 10 .
“ Two are better than one , because they have a good reward for their hard work .
True , Jehovah appointed the husband as head of the family .
A wise husband will not make arbitrary decisions .
Tanya , now married for seven years , says : “ It isn’t about who is right and who is wrong .
In his day , a yoke was a beam of wood that tied two animals together so that they could perform work .
What We Learn From Jesus
What is God’s Kingdom ?
Jesus said : “ You must pray , then , this way : . . .
‘ Let your kingdom come .
Additionally , Jesus chose some of his followers to rule with him .
A total of 144,000 of Jesus ’ followers will rule along with him . ​ — Revelation 5 : 9 , 10 ; 14 : 1 .
Jesus said to his disciples : “ If I go my way and prepare a place for you [ in heaven ] , I am coming again and will receive you home to myself , that where I am you also may be . . . . I am going my way to the Father . ” ​ — John 14 : 2 , 3 , 12 ; Daniel 7 : 13 , 14 .
While on earth , Jesus spoke to the crowds “ about the kingdom of God , and he healed those needing a cure . ”
After seeing the resurrected Jesus in a vision , the apostle John said : “ I saw a new heaven and a new earth . . . I heard a loud voice from the throne say : ‘ Look !
Consider , for example , the incident described at John 11 : 33 - 35 .
Was there something else that also touched Jesus ’ emotions ?
Look again at the above - quoted words .
The surge of strong emotions within him was evident as his eyes brimmed with tears .
Indeed , other Bible writers confirm this fact .
Empathy attracts .

In his renowned Sermon on the Mount , Jesus highlighted the importance of being mild - tempered , merciful , and peaceable .
See how you could identify Jehovah as the Great Deliverer and show others how God’s Kingdom will soon deliver mankind .
Can they succeed in leading a life of dedication to Jehovah regardless of how others might view them ?
How can the example of the apostle Paul help all in the congregation to make spiritual progress ?
Questions of such importance are discussed in these two articles . ALSO IN THIS ISSUE :
PAGE 29 Jehovah’s Word Is Alive ​ — Highlights From the Book of Acts PAGE 30
When his religious foes sent men to arrest him , the officers returned empty - handed and said : “ Never has another man spoken like this . ”
For instance , we “ return evil for evil to no one . ” ​ — Rom .
Jesus , who was “ mild - tempered and lowly in heart , ” is the “ appointed heir of all things ” and is therefore the principal Inheritor of the earth .
As “ joint heirs with Christ , ” 144,000 mild - tempered anointed ones were to share in Jesus ’ inheritance of the earth .
“ The merciful ” have tender compassion and show kind consideration , even pity , for the disadvantaged .
Jesus miraculously relieved suffering because he “ felt pity , ” or was “ moved with pity . ”
When a crowd met Jesus on his way to get some rest , “ he was moved with pity for them , because they were as sheep without a shepherd . ”
Consequently , “ he started to teach them many things . ”
Moreover , Jesus said : “ If you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you . ”
How will we act if we are peaceable ?
Why are “ the peaceable ” happy ?
What about Jesus ’ peaceable “ other sheep ” ?
15 : 27 , 28 .
Yes , we will be happy peacemakers .
( a ) What did Jesus say about spiritual light ?
“ A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain , ” said Jesus .
It was after he mentioned a shining lamp that Jesus told his disciples : “ Likewise let your light shine before men , that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens . ”
17 - 19 . ( a ) What was the “ gift ” mentioned at Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 21 - 25 . )
If you were bringing your gift to the altar and there remembered that your brother had something against you , what were you to do ?
But if you recalled that your brother had something against you , settling that matter was of even greater urgency than offering your gift .
“ Leave your gift there in front of the altar , and go away , ” said Jesus .
“ First make your peace with your brother , and then , when you have come back , offer up your gift . ”
Jesus did not limit his statement to particular offerings and specific transgressions .
If the offering was a living animal , it was to be left “ in front of the altar ” of burnt offering in the priests ’ courtyard of the temple .
Always Treat Others With Respect
( b ) What will we consider in the next article ?
With prayer , sincere effort , and Jehovah God’s blessing , we can be mild - tempered , merciful , and peaceable .
In the next article , we will consider other statements in the Sermon on the Mount that should help us to keep on doing good to others .
After meditating on the foregoing points drawn from Jesus ’ matchless discourse , however , we might ask ourselves , ‘ How well do I treat others ? ’
Declaring the Kingdom message is a vital way to let our light shine
[ Picture on page 6 ]
Keep On Doing Good
Although we seek the spiritual welfare of people by endeavoring to share with them “ the glorious good news of the happy God ” and his Son , they may be apathetic or ungrateful .
“ Love Your Enemies ”
His disciples were to act lovingly toward all who showed hostility to them .
And we “ pray for those persecuting ” us with physical violence or other forms of “ insulting ” treatment .
Why should we love our enemies ?
“ That you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens , ” said Jesus .
Even tax collectors , who were generally despised , showed love for people who loved them . ​ — Luke 5 : 30 ; 7 : 34 .
We need to imitate God , who freely forgives repentant sinners .
For he himself well knows the formation of us , remembering that we are dust . ” ​ — Ps .

3 : 13 .
Another way to do good was set out in the Sermon on the Mount when Jesus told his listeners to stop judging others and then used a powerful illustration to emphasize this point .
( Read Matthew 7 : 1 - 5 . )
Let us consider what Jesus meant when he said : “ Stop judging . ”
Instead , they were to “ keep on releasing , ” that is , forgiving the shortcomings of others .
With respect to our treatment of others , we reap what we sow . ​ — Gal .
6 : 7 .
A person inclined to criticize another individual takes note of a minor defect in his brother’s “ eye . ”
He hypocritically volunteers to help the brother see things more clearly .
Jesus therefore exclaimed : “ Hypocrite ! First extract the rafter from your own eye , and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother’s eye . ”
( Read Matthew 7 : 7 - 12 . )
Happy is the mortal man that does this , and the son of mankind that lays hold of it , . . . keeping his hand in order not to do any kind of badness . ’ ”
Yes , God expects his people to keep on doing good .
How Would You Answer ?
• Why should we be forgiving ?
[ Blurb on page 10 ]
Do you always treat others as you would like to be treated ?
What was Jesus ’ main teaching ?
WHEN Jesus Christ gave his Sermon on the Mount , he included a model prayer that summarized his main teaching .
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also upon earth . ”
Christ urged his followers : ‘ Keep on seeking first the kingdom and God’s righteousness . ’
For instance , consider how you might answer these questions : How important is the Kingdom message ?
Jesus foretold : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations ; and then the end will come . ”
The good news about God’s Kingdom is of utmost importance .
Its establishment is good news because it means that God has set up a government in heaven to take full control of earth’s affairs .
People will not get sick or die because of inherited sin and imperfection .
Even animals that are now dangerous will be at peace with humans and with one another . ​ — Ps .
46 : 9 ; 72 : 16 ; Isa .
For all of this to happen , the present system of things with its conflicting governments , religions , and commercial systems will have to be removed .
And that is exactly what the heavenly government will do .
God’s Kingdom ​ — a new heavenly government — ​ will then rule over a new earthly society .
There will be “ new heavens and a new earth . . . , and in these righteousness is to dwell . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 13 .
Before the global Flood , over 1,600 years later , “ the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time . ”
Conditions in the past 100 years have been worse than ever , and they continue to deteriorate .
Surely , thousands of years of human rule have proved the truthfulness of the words : “ To earthling man his way does not belong .
However , the good news is that God will soon deliver those who love him .
Why is Jehovah the only reliable Source of deliverance ?
We can be certain that Jehovah will always deliver his people and fulfill his purposes , for he has sworn : “ Surely just as I have figured , so it must occur . ”
Jehovah has guaranteed that he will deliver his servants when he executes judgment upon the wicked .
Why not ?
Even on a worldwide scale , Jehovah can deliver those who do his will .
As a result of that worldwide destruction , ‘ the upright will reside in the earth , but the wicked will be cut off from it . ’ ​ — Prov .
How will Jehovah’s servants who have died be delivered ?
However , many of God’s servants have already died because of illness , persecution , and other factors .
God has put the Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ , the one best qualified to rule the earth .
No wonder the Scriptures counsel us not to put our trust in man , “ to whom no salvation belongs ” !
But what a fine spirit will mark Christ’s rule !
“ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , ” said Jesus , “ and I will refresh you .
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment for your souls .
( Read Matthew 24 : 21 . )
The great tribulation will begin suddenly .
At a critical point , there will be “ signs in sun and moon and stars , ” and “ the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven . ”
• How does Jehovah prove to be the Great Deliverer ?

Jehovah “ will wipe out every tear . . . , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Rev .
“ Continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe . ” ​ — 2 TIM .
You young ones in the Christian congregation , have you made a dedication to Jehovah ?
Business leaders , educators , and sometimes family members and friends point youths toward materialistic goals .
But the fact is that serving the true God is the best way of life you can pursue .
Why should you serve the true and living God ?
What divine acts drew Joshua close to Jehovah ?
Another reason to serve Jehovah is found in the words of the Israelite leader Joshua .
Joshua knew that Jehovah had kept His promises .
Hence , Joshua declared : “ As for me and my household , we shall serve Jehovah . ”
What about you ?
Why is water baptism a vital step to take ?
Why did Jesus take that step ?
Most important of all , you will make Jehovah’s heart rejoice .
True , others may not understand why you have chosen to worship Jehovah , and they may question your decision .
They may even oppose you .
But you can successfully meet these challenges .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What questions may people ask you about your decision to serve God ?
( b ) What can you learn from the way Jesus answered questions about true worship ?
Your decision to serve Jehovah may leave schoolmates , neighbors , and relatives perplexed .
When Jewish religious leaders interrogated Jesus about the resurrection , he directed their attention to a scripture that they had not taken into account .
( Read 1 John 5 : 19 . )
The apostle Peter also did , and he wrote : “ Beloved ones , do not be puzzled at the burning [ suffering ] among you , which is happening to you for a trial , as though a strange thing were befalling you . On the contrary , go on rejoicing forasmuch as you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
Enduring persecution or opposition as a Christian is a reason to rejoice .
Because having the world’s approval would indicate that you are living according to Satan’s standards ​ — not God’s .
Persecution indicates that Satan and his world are angry with you because you serve Jehovah .
It was the door leading to great activity in preaching the good news and making disciples in that city .
By going through that door , Paul helped many to learn about Jehovah and worship Him .
Kingdom Hall construction , Bethel service , and the missionary field are other opportunities that may open up to many of you .
In old age , David said : “ You are my hope , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah , my confidence from my youth .
Then expand your ministry , and make steady spiritual progress .

However , he ‘ conducted himself in harmony with the desires of his flesh . ’
Paul’s Routine of Study
Right after his baptism , he “ went off into Arabia ” ​ — either the Syrian Desert or possibly some quiet place on the Arabian Peninsula that was conducive to meditation .
Paul apparently wanted to reflect upon the scriptures that proved that Jesus was the Messiah .
Paul also referred to the holy writings several times .
Wiser than my enemies your commandment makes me , because to time indefinite it is mine .
He “ went so far as to persecuting them even in outside cities . ” ​ — Acts 26 : 11 .
When the Lord Jesus appeared to him , Saul was on his way to Damascus to harass Christ’s disciples there .
By the time that Jehovah used Ananias to restore Saul’s sight , Saul’s attitude toward people had changed forever .
Paul was not content with just being at peace with others .
Jehovah forgave Paul , and receiving such undeserved kindness and mercy moved him to show love to others by preaching the good news to them .
Paul acted in harmony with any request he might have made for more workers by becoming a zealous worker .
2 : 16 .
Paul recognized that other Christians were also effective ministers of the good news .
How did Paul show humility and modesty in connection with the issue of circumcision ?
Consider how Paul handled a problem that arose in the Syrian city of Antioch .
The Christian congregation there was split over the issue of circumcision .
The departure of a proud , aloof man would not have caused that reaction . ​ — Acts 20 : 37 , 38 .
Another way is by highly esteeming all our brothers and sisters in the faith .
The congregations of Jehovah’s people are often composed of individuals of diverse national , cultural , racial , and ethnic backgrounds .
15 : 7 .
“ Run With Endurance ” the Race for Life
Paul wrote : “ I have run the course to the finish , I have observed the faith .
[ Picture on page 23 ]
[ Picture on page 24 ]
ATTRIBUTING holiness in the superlative degree to Jehovah God , the Bible states : “ Holy , holy , holy is Jehovah . ”
The Hebrew and Greek words for “ holiness ” convey the idea of purity or religious cleanness , of being set apart from defilement .
Would not the holy God , Jehovah , expect those who worship him to be holy , that is to be physically as well as morally and spiritually clean ?
In no uncertain terms , the Bible shows that Jehovah wants his people to be holy .
As Jehovah’s worshippers today , we enjoy a clean , tranquil spiritual environment in which we can worship Jehovah and have a peaceful relationship with him and with our fellow man .
Those desiring God’s favor today need to meet the same requirement .
Loose conduct involves “ licentiousness ; wantonness ; shameless conduct ; lewdness of conduct . ”
Suppose a Christian secretly begins to view pornography .
Consider another example .
7 : 1 ; Col .
Today , hurtful , vulgar speech has become very common , even in the home .
Pornography damages one’s relationship with Jehovah
[ Picture on page 28 ]
“ Let all . . . screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you ”
THE Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses consists of dedicated men who are anointed servants of God .
This enables these brothers to work together in unity .
It makes sure that all the committees operate smoothly and efficiently .
This committee oversees the selecting and inviting of new members of Bethel families and handles questions regarding their Bethel service .
The Head , Jesus Christ , supplies the body members with what is needed for good cooperation , coordination , and spiritual nourishment .
In such respects , the Governing Body is organized to take the lead as Jehovah directs them by holy spirit .
It will also move us to be self - sacrificing and will build up our faith in the Kingdom hope .
After receiving the holy spirit , the apostles give a bold witness .
2 : 44 - 47 ; 4 : 34 , 35 ​ — Why did believers sell their possessions and distribute the proceeds ?
One’s worship ​ — and therefore one’s prayers — ​ should go only to Jehovah God .
Lessons for Us :
1 : 8 .
Joseph of Cyprus was surnamed Barnabas , which means “ Son of Comfort . ”
We should be like him and not like Ananias and Sapphira , who resorted to pretense , hypocrisy , and deviousness .
During relatively peaceful times , we should strive to fortify our faith through study and meditation .
In 44 C.E . , Agabus comes to Antioch , where Barnabas and Saul have been teaching “ for a whole year . ”
“ After having fully carried out the relief ministration in Jerusalem , ” Barnabas and Saul return to Antioch .
Leaving Timothy and Silas in Corinth , Paul takes Aquila and Priscilla with him and sails away for Syria early in 52 C.E .
Paul spends about three years there .
Zeus was the ruler of the gods in Greek mythology , and his son Hermes was known for his eloquence .
There were just a few workers .
Gallio perhaps thought that the man who seemed to be the leader of the mob action against Paul was getting what he deserved .
However , the Bible does not state what Paul’s vow was .
Herod readily accepted glory that should be given only to God .
How that differed from the immediate and emphatic rejection of undue praise and honor by Paul and Barnabas !
Maintaining integrity to God is more important than preserving our life .
Logically , we need to find out what God’s own view is on the matter .
And the faithful apostle Paul testified : “ All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight . ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 16 .
When the people did what those laws , commonly called the Mosaic Law , required , they were accepted by God as his people and were blessed by him .
Is that really so ?
Scholars identify these figurines with the fertility goddesses Ashtoreth and Asherah .
Inscriptions found at archaeological sites seem to support this view .
These examples illustrate how the Israelites compromised by mixing the pure worship of Jehovah God with shameful pagan practices .
How did God view this form of compromised worship ?
The major lesson for us is that God does not accept worship that attempts to mix Bible - based teachings with dogmas , traditions , or rituals of other religions .
This is a lesson that the apostle Paul clearly took to heart .
Further , what harmony is there between Christ and Belial ?
‘ Therefore get out from among them , and separate yourselves , ’ says Jehovah , ‘ and quit touching the unclean thing ’ ; ‘ and I will take you in . ’ ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 6 : 14 - 17 .
Realizing that it does matter to God how we worship him , we may ask ourselves : ‘ What kind of worship does God approve ?
And what should I personally do to worship God in an acceptable way ? ’
Ashtoreth figurines from ancient Judean homes
HAVE you ever known someone who was very sick ? — Did you wish you could do something to help him ? — What if he was from a different country or of a different religion ?
She is taken to Syria , where she becomes the servant of the wife of Naaman , the Syrian army chief .
She says : ‘ If Naaman were in Samaria , Jehovah’s prophet Elisha could make his leprosy go away . ’
He expects Elisha to come out and wave his hand over the leprosy to make it go away .
He promises Elisha that he will never again “ render up a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other gods but to Jehovah . ” ​ — 2 Kings 5 : 13 - 17 .
And Jesus healed him , just as Jehovah had healed Naaman . ​ — Matthew 8 : 2 , 3 .
What did Jesus want to do , and why will life be wonderful in God’s new world ?
With those heartwarming words , the Bible assures us that Jehovah God is generous with his forgiveness .
Jesus uttered no harsh words , no condemnation .
Jesus repeated the question a second time , and Peter gave the same answer , perhaps more emphatically .
Jesus said : “ Shepherd my little sheep . ”
Jesus answered : “ Feed my little sheep . ” ​ — John 21 : 15 - 17 .
Is that not a comforting thought ?

Questions From Readers
Jehovah’s Word Is Alive ​ — Highlights From the Letter to the Romans
Powerful Despite Weaknesses
Whatever the cause , you seem to be trapped .
How can you break out of such despair ?
For example , you might consider Jehovah’s inspired questions to his faithful servant Job : “ Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth ?
Who set its measurements , in case you know , or who stretched out upon it the measuring line ? ”
He has allowed the present world situation to continue for good reason .
Paul likened it to being constantly slapped .
Jehovah’s answer was : “ My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you ; for my power is being made perfect in weakness . ”
Paul had to contend with it , but he added : “ When I am weak , then I am powerful . ”
Paul stated why God did not remove his thorn in the flesh : “ That I might not be overly exalted . ”
Paul’s “ thorn ” reminded him of his limitations and helped him to maintain a humble view of himself .
That is in line with what Jesus taught : “ Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
Trials can teach God’s servants humility and help them to appreciate that to endure faithfully they need to rely on Jehovah .
Some may have weaknesses that they are not aware of or that they are reluctant to acknowledge .
He brutally murdered two army generals .
Joab had been replaced by Amasa as army general and used this opportunity to get rid of his rival , probably in hopes of being reinstated as general .
When King David was near the end of his life , he instructed his son Solomon to see to it that Joab paid for his badness . ​ — 1 Ki .
The battle may even continue for as long as we are imperfect .
Elsewhere , Paul said : “ I pummel my body and lead it as a slave , that , after I have preached to others , I myself should not become disapproved somehow . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
David requested of Jehovah : “ Refine my kidneys and my heart . ”
Nevertheless , many have learned to cope , and that has enabled them to lead productive lives .
She says : “ I tearfully and fervently thanked Jehovah for all his help ; it kept me going .
When individuals feel unworthy , they may think that Jehovah will not listen to their call for help in their time of distress .
We can do everything humanly possible and then look to Jehovah with full assurance that he will guide our steps .

The prophet there apparently refers to going out “ of Jerusalem to the surrounding Hinnom Valley ( Gehenna ) , where human sacrifice was once practiced and which eventually became the city’s refuse heap . ”
There the prophet shows the two ways corpses were usually destroyed : putrefaction and incineration . . .
The most reliable Bible manuscripts do not include verses 44 and 46 .
Professor Archibald T .
Robertson writes : “ The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two verses .
“ They will actually go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that were transgressing against me ; for the very worms upon them will not die and their fire itself will not be extinguished , and they must become something repulsive to all flesh . ” ​ — Isa .
11 : 26 ) Did he mean that at some point all Jews would be converted to Christianity ?
In what way ?
Paul called this nation “ the Israel of God . ” ​ — Gal .
Other passages in the Christian Greek Scriptures establish that “ the Israel of God ” is made up of 144,000 spirit - anointed Christians .
Of course , such Jews , like all other humans , had to be bought with the blood of Jesus Christ . ​ — 1 Tim .
That is true with regard to God’s purpose to install 144,000 corulers alongside his Son in heaven .
Not one would be missing ! ​ — Rev .
Paul also says : “ A man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law . ”
2 : 21 - 24 ; Matt .
25 : 46 .
“ Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness ? ”
“ Never may that happen ! ”
“ You are slaves . . . , either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view , ” Paul explains .
8 : 13 .
When Jehovah anoints followers of Christ with the holy spirit , they are united with Jesus and become members of the congregation that is the body of Christ , he being the Head .
The Law helped people to realize the full range , or scope , of sin , making them more conscious of being sinners .
Lessons for Us :
2 : 28 ; 3 : 1 , 2 ; 7 : 6 , 7 .

By having a zealous share in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work , we can help others find God to be true .

8 : 38 , 39 .
9 : 22 - 28 ; 11 : 1 , 5 , 17 - 26 .
Along with love for God and our fellow man , strong faith in Jehovah and his promises can motivate us to have a zealous share in the Christian ministry .
How beautifully balanced are “ God’s kindness and severity ” !

Scriptural Questions Answered :
In Bible times , ore was put in a furnace with a layer of coals placed on top as well as underneath .
Lessons for Us :
To retaliate against evil is to take into our own hands what should be left up to Jehovah .
We should impartially welcome all sincere seekers of truth into the congregation and proclaim the Kingdom message to all we meet .

WHAT do you think of when you hear the word “ flee ” ?
The examples mentioned above involved fleeing in a literal way .

A Future Wrath From Which to Flee
Like the religious leaders whom Jesus condemned , the modern - day worshippers who are part of “ the son of destruction ” face destruction with no hope of a resurrection .

( b ) After the conquest of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians , what sort of fleeing became possible ?
This happened soon after the Medes and the Persians conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.E .
Among “ the disgusting things ” that she bears responsibility for are the many wars that have resulted in hundreds of millions being “ slaughtered on the earth . ”
Hopefully , they will see the need to “ flee out of the midst of Babylon ” before it is too late . ​ — Rev .
Flee From Idolatry
How does God view the veneration of images and idols ?
All who want to please God must avoid idolatry , in harmony with God’s statement : “ I am Jehovah . That is my name ; and to no one else shall I give my own glory , neither my praise to graven images . ” ​ — Isa .
( b ) What should we do if we experience unclean sexual desire ?
In his first letter to Timothy , Paul highlighted principles that should govern Christian slaves , some of whom may have expected material advantages because of having Christian owners .
Paul warned against “ thinking that godly devotion is a means of [ material ] gain . ”
Paul urged Timothy : “ You , O man of God , flee from these things .
Many Christian youths whose parents do not share their faith seek to find and apply principles set out in the Bible .
Regardless of who gives Bible - based counsel , submitting to it can lead to happiness both now and in the future . ​ — Heb .

The next article will consider seven of these .
What do you think of when you hear the word “ flee ” ?
Or you may recall the danger faced by an accidental manslayer in ancient Israel .
The vast majority of true Christians today , however , have a different prospect , or goal .
How can we show appreciation for God’s undeserved kindness ?
“ Pursue Righteousness ”
Why can we be sure that the pursuit of “ righteousness ” is important , and what initial steps must a person take ?
In both of his letters to Timothy , the apostle Paul listed qualities to be pursued , and each time , he mentioned “ righteousness ” first .
Moreover , in other passages the Bible repeatedly encourages us to pursue righteousness .

What must we do to gain and maintain a righteous standing with God ?
Being righteous is different from being self - righteous or “ righteous overmuch . ”
Truly pursuing righteousness involves the heart ​ — the correcting of wrong thoughts , attitudes , motives , and desires .
One Bible dictionary notes that the Greek word translated “ godly devotion ” describes “ the good and careful cherishing of the fear of God . ”
( b ) How was the answer to this “ sacred secret ” revealed ?
Thus , Jehovah inspired Paul to speak of “ godly devotion ” in describing Jesus ’ exemplary life course . ​ — Read 1 Timothy 3 : 16 .
But we can pursue it .
This calls on us to follow Christ’s model as closely as possible .
Thus , we will not be like the hypocrites who ‘ have a form of godly devotion but prove false to its power . ’
Yes , the pursuit of godly devotion requires that we take God’s righteous standards into consideration in our daily lives .
Three exceptional books are The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived , Learn From the Great Teacher , and “ Come Be My Follower , ” volumes that are designed to help us get to know Christ better and thus be in a position to imitate him .
The slave class also arranges for meetings , assemblies , and conventions , many of which highlight “ the word about Christ . ”
Do you see any ways in which you could take greater advantage of these as you pay “ more than the usual attention ” to what God provides ? ​ — Heb .
6 : 33 .
Paul gave practical counsel on how Christians can show love for one another .
Can you think of occasions when you have displayed love in a practical way ?
“ Pursue . . . Endurance ”
Indeed , Jesus taught about the need for endurance ​ — a quality that helps us not to give up when facing trials and temptations .
What did Jesus teach about endurance ?
However , he likened his faithful followers to fine soil in that they “ retain ” the word of God and “ bear fruit with endurance . ” ​ — Luke 8 : 13 , 15 .
What loving provision has helped millions to endure ?
Our meditating on a portion of God’s Word every day will help us to find the needed strength to keep on bearing fruit “ with endurance . ” ​ — Ps .
( a ) Why is “ mildness of temper ” so important ?
It takes great strength to be mild when dealing with unjust criticism .
In imitation of Jesus , may we be “ always ready to make a defense ” of our beliefs , “ doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect . ”
We have touched on seven Christian qualities that we are encouraged to pursue ​ — righteousness , godly devotion , faith , love , endurance , mildness of temper , and peace .
( b ) Are those who claim to be nonconformists truly independent ?
One author boasted : “ I do not endow my parents or a priest or a minister or a guru or the Bible with the power to decide what is true for me . ”
How did first - century Christians show that they did not blindly submit to human authority ?
As Christians , we take a position different from that of the world .
Such examples show that , historically , God’s people have taken a firm stand for what is right , regardless of the consequences .
Then your peace would become just like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea . ”
But there is another aspect of our obedience that we should not overlook .
How is having our “ perceptive powers trained ” related to accepting Jehovah’s authority ?
The Bible tells us that we should have our “ perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ”
We want to see the wisdom of Jehovah’s ways , so that we can say as did the psalmist : “ Your law is within my inward parts . ” ​ — Ps .
40 : 8 .
To appreciate God’s laws as the psalmist did , we need to meditate on what we read in the Bible .
What bad consequences have befallen those who have ignored God’s counsel in this matter ? ’
Some opt to live together , while others scheme to be freed from their spouse .
11 , 12 . ( a ) Why may it be hard for youths to accept Jehovah’s authority ?
( b ) Relate an experience showing the folly of disregarding Jehovah’s laws and principles .
If so , you may be a special target of Satan’s attempts to undermine Jehovah’s authority .
“ The desires incidental to youth ” coupled with pressure from your peers may incline you to conclude that God’s laws are burdensome .
Are they really happy now ?
She recognized that it was foolish to break Jehovah’s laws and that she should have treated them with the greatest respect .
Sharon died just seven weeks after writing the above words .
As her tragic experience shows , Satan has nothing good to offer those who become part of this wicked system .
In accepting Jehovah’s authority , we need to guard against an independent spirit .
A haughty attitude can cause us to feel that we do not need guidance from anyone .
For example , we might resist counsel given by those taking the lead among God’s people .
Be like the faithful apostles .
14 , 15 .
For example , the faithful and discreet slave class has been admonishing us to “ stay awake and keep our senses . ”
Hence , how wise it is to accept the Bible’s counsel and avoid the self - serving lifestyle that is so prevalent in Satan’s world ! ​ — 1 John 2 : 16 .
Yes , make it your aim to resist the world’s spirit of independence and to accept Jehovah’s authority .
Strive in all aspects of life to show that you reject an independent spirit and that you accept Jehovah’s authority .
Do You Recall ?
Keep “ the Love You Had at First ”
3 : 11 .
Perhaps you realized that you had been misled .
Did you have a similar experience ?
Yet , it is possible that even now some Christians may lose “ the love [ they ] had at first ” for Jehovah and for Christian truth .
What impressed others was the love among Jehovah’s people .
Still others reasoned on what it means to be no part of the world .
They concluded that true Christians cannot share in the political controversies or the wars of any nation . ​ — Isa .
Your first love for the truth was important , but as time went by , you needed a deeper love to face new challenges that put your faith to the test .
However , Jehovah sustained you .
34 : 8 .
Yes , Jehovah proved to be just what he needed to be for you .
11 , 12 .
Could legitimate concerns , such as providing adequately for your family , caring for your health , or the like , have blunted your sense of urgency as to the nearness of Jehovah’s day ?
But he who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in it , this man , because he has become , not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , will be happy in his doing it . ” ​ — Jas .
If such self - examination reveals any deficiencies , do not ignore them .
If adjustments are needed , by all means make them without delay . ​ — Heb .
After all , the objective of self - examination is to identify where improvement can be made .
( Read Matthew 10 : 29 - 31 . )
An awareness of your imperfections should instead make you humbly resolved to do better , with Jehovah’s help .
Great benefits are to be had from continuing to build on the foundation of the love you had at first .
You understand the reasons behind what is going on in the world .
Count your blessings !
Doing that every so often will undoubtedly help you to apply the admonition : “ Keep on holding fast what you have . ” ​ — Rev .
This journal has repeatedly drawn attention to other essentials to maintaining spiritual health .
When a Loved One Dies
She was watching TV when she heard the news about the plane crash .
Her son , Renato , was on the plane . He was only 26 .
He had planned to get married in October .
Antje lost her fiancé in a tragic car accident in January 1986 .
How is it possible to cope with the loss of a loved one ?
Along with his grandfather Abraham and his father , Isaac , Jacob is commended for his outstanding faith .
Evidently , Jacob was a deeply spiritual man .
At first , he refused to believe that it was true .
At such times , he often broke down and cried .
As Leonardo’s experience well illustrates , grief can be intense .
Just as a severe physical wound takes time to heal , so it is with bereavement .
Recovering from grief may take months , a few years , or even longer .
But the acute pain you feel in the beginning will lessen in time , and life will gradually seem less bleak and meaningless .
We need to adjust to life without that person .
How , then , can you express your grief in healthy ways ?
Notice , for example , the words of the Bible character Job , who suffered the loss of all ten of his children and endured other tragedies . He said : “ My soul certainly feels a loathing toward my life .
Jesus Christ “ gave way to tears ” when he neared the tomb of his dear friend Lazarus , who had recently died . ​ — John 11 : 33 , 35 .
Think about this .
I begged him to help me . ”
You too may find that in response to your persistent prayers , “ the God of all comfort ” will give you the courage and the strength to cope . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 ; Romans 12 : 12 .
Jesus said : “ I am the resurrection and the life . He that exercises faith in me , even though he dies , will come to life . ”
Imagine the great ecstasy when the dead come back to life and are reunited with their loved ones !
It can be to you too !

This Bible verse indicates that God can help his faithful servants to endure any problem or challenge that they may face .
He had just arrived home , and when he remembered that no one was there , he began to cry uncontrollably .
Suddenly , a van stopped nearby , and Leonardo recognized that the driver was one of his Christian brothers .
He recalls : “ Our brief conversation was enough to give me renewed courage .
I could not help but feel that her phone call was the answer to a prayer for help . ”

Bringing Comfort to Others
Consider the example of Claudete , who regularly visits others to share her Bible - based beliefs .
The woman enjoyed the visits , but she felt that Claudete would never fully comprehend her pain .
However , soon after Claudete’s son died , the woman visited her and told her that she had come to see if Claudete still maintained her faith now that her son had died .
Impressed by Claudete’s strong faith , the woman is having a regular Bible study with Claudete and is finding much comfort from God’s Word .
He says : “ One of the things that has helped me to cope with my grief is my desire to help the deaf to learn about God .
Writing can be helpful in expressing grief
Second , Jehovah “ gives to all persons life and breath and all things . ”
Is it reasonable to believe that our generous God would keep to himself and thereby deny us the gift of knowing who he is and of drawing close to him ?
So the opportunity to draw close to him is open to us regardless of our skin color , nationality , or ethnic background .
We will “ really find him , ” Paul assures us . ​ — Verse 27 .
He did not ask for her father or her mother .
This one would stand out anywhere .
She was engaged to marry the carpenter Joseph ​ — not a wealthy man but a faithful one .
Suddenly , though , she found herself faced with this visitor who brought her an assignment from her God , a responsibility that would change her life .
Let us instead focus on what the Bible actually reveals .
A Visit From an Angel
Mary’s visitor , as you may know , was no mere man .
When he called Mary “ highly favored one , ” she was “ deeply disturbed ” by his words and wondered about this unusual greeting .
Still , she did not proudly presume that she had God’s favor .
He explained that she was to bear a child who would become the most important of all humans .
Today , many youths are eager to cast off their virginity and quick to ridicule those who do not .
Gabriel explained : “ Holy spirit will come upon you , and power of the Most High will overshadow you .
Mary’s Response to Gabriel
Skeptics , including some theologians of Christendom , have a hard time believing that a virgin could give birth .
For all their education , they fail to grasp a simple truth .
She had her assignment before her and had evidence that God was going to do all that Gabriel had said .
She was to carry the life of the most precious of all of God’s creatures ​ — his own beloved Son !
She would have to care for him when he was a helpless infant and protect him in a wicked world .
She knew that she was safe in his hands , that he is loyal to those who are loyal to him , and that he would bless her as she did her best with this challenging assignment . ​ — Psalm 18 : 25 .
Further , she was inspired to commend Mary for her faithful obedience , saying : “ Happy too is she that believed . ”
In turn , Mary spoke .
Her words are carefully preserved at Luke 1 : 46 - 55 .
Both women remind us of the importance of friendships .
If we seek out friends who truly love our God , Jehovah , we are sure to grow spiritually and draw closer to him .
Mary and Joseph
Beforehand , she may have wondered how this decent , God - fearing man would respond to what she had to tell him .
But it does say that he decided to divorce her , for engaged couples were then viewed as being married .
He took Mary as his wife , and he prepared to take on the unique responsibility of caring for Jehovah’s Son . ​ — Matthew 1 : 20 - 24 .
Married people ​ — and those contemplating marriage — ​ do well to learn from this young couple of 2,000 years ago .
Although at first he may have found her story difficult to comprehend , she waited on him as the man who would be the family head .

Our Readers Ask
A major reason why the Witnesses refrain from taking part in war is that participating in such conflicts would violate their Christian conscience .
Another reason Jehovah’s Witnesses do not go to war is that they are members of a worldwide community of believers .
As an example , examine their course of action during World War II , 1939 - 1945 .
Any individuals who lost their loved ones on the battlefields of World War II ​ — or any subsequent war for that matter — ​ can rest assured that not a single one of Jehovah’s Witnesses was responsible for such deaths .
In 1942 the Nazis beheaded this 20 - year - old German because he refused to go to war .
The greatest and most holy law he gave mankind is : ‘ You shall love your God above all else and your neighbor as yourself . ’
According to first - century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus , inscriptions in Greek and Latin were posted on this barrier , warning Gentiles not to cross it so as not to set foot within the holy precincts .
Whosoever is caught will be responsible for his death which will ensue . ”
Jehovah told Moses : “ Only the tribe of Levi you must not register , and the sum of them you must not take in among the sons of Israel . And you yourself appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony and over all its utensils and over everything that belongs to it . ” ​ — Numbers 1 : 49 , 50 .
For these two reasons , the tribe of Levi was not generally included when the tribes were listed .
That is to say , God’s name is represented by four Hebrew letters Yohdh , He , Waw , and He , commonly transliterated YHWH .
According to this translation , when Moses asked God how he should respond if the Israelites were to ask him who had sent him to them , God replied : “ You are to say to the sons of Israel : ‘ Yahweh , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ’ This is my name for all time ; by this name I shall be invoked for all generations to come . ” ​ — Exodus 3 : 15 .
While praying , Jesus said regarding his own use of the divine name : “ I have made your name known to them and will continue to make it known . ”
It might come as a surprise , then , to learn that in his recent book Jesus of Nazareth , Pope Benedict XVI had this to say concerning the use of the divine name : “ The Israelites were . . . perfectly right in refusing to utter this self - designation of God , expressed in the word YHWH , so as to avoid degrading it to the level of names of pagan deities .

Jehovah’s Slave Girl ! ”
Where is house - to - house preaching specifically mentioned in the Bible ?
Some 20 years later , the apostle Paul reminded the older men of the congregation in Ephesus : “ I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house . ”
From 1919 on , the responsibility of each Christian to have a personal share in witnessing has been stressed .
Detailed presentations were provided in the Bulletin ( now Our Kingdom Ministry ) .
They raised various objections , but the basic problem was that some felt it beneath their dignity to preach from house to house .
During the early 1950 ’ s , 28 percent of the Witnesses in that country limited their preaching activity to distributing handbills or standing on the streets with magazines .
8 , 9 .
What training program was initiated in 1953 , and with what results ?
Brother Nathan H .
The results of this training program were outstanding .
Within a decade , the number of publishers worldwide increased by 100 percent , the number of return visits by 126 percent , and the number of Bible studies by 150 percent .
The seventh man is told to “ pass through the midst of the city ” and “ put a mark on the foreheads of the men that are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the midst of it . ”
Following that marking work , the six men with the slaughtering weapons are commanded to execute all those who do not have the mark . ​ — Read Ezekiel 9 : 1 - 6 .
22 : 17 .
How does Ezekiel’s vision about marking foreheads highlight the importance of our ongoing search for sheeplike ones ?
Hence , the proclamation of God’s message must continue unabated right to the end .
In the prophecy recorded at Malachi 1 : 11 , Jehovah declares : “ From the sun’s rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations , and . . . a presentation will be made to my name , even a clean gift ; because my name will be great among the nations . ”
13 : 15 .
The siege of Jericho , recorded in the book of Joshua , provides an illustration .
No doubt , by the time of the destruction of the present system of things , we will have seen the greatest witness to God’s name and Kingdom in the history of this world .
16 , 17 . ( a ) What will be accomplished before “ the great tribulation ” is finished ?
7 : 14 ; Ezek .
These questions will be considered in the following article .
How Would You Answer ?
Meeting the Challenges of the House - to - House Ministry
“ We mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God with a great deal of struggling . ” ​ — 1 THESS .
2 : 2 .
When Jehovah informed him of his commission to be “ prophet to the nations , ” he cried out : “ Alas , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah !
Nevertheless , trusting in Jehovah , he accepted the assignment .
Even so , many of us faced circumstances in our lives that made it difficult , at least for a time , to keep on preaching .
Or what if you are a baptized Witness who finds it difficult to share in the door - to - door work , even though you are physically able to do so ?
Be assured that people of all backgrounds are meeting the challenges of the house - to - house ministry .
( Read Ephesians 6 : 18 - 20 . )
How can we imitate Paul’s example ?
A pioneer said : “ I pray that I can speak with confidence , pray that I can reach the hearts of people , and pray that I can find joy in the ministry .
After all , this is Jehovah’s work , not our own , so we can do nothing without his help . ”
In a vision , Jehovah gave Ezekiel a scroll written on both sides with “ dirges and moaning and wailing ” and told him to eat it , saying : “ Son of man , you should cause your own belly to eat , that you may fill your very intestines with this roll that I am giving you . ”
He felt highly privileged to represent Jehovah and to fulfill this God - given assignment , even though that meant delivering a strong message to an unreceptive people . ​ — Read Ezekiel 2 : 8 – 3 : 4 , 7 - 9 .
We too have a strong message to deliver to people who are not always appreciative of our efforts .
For us to continue to view the Christian ministry as a God - given privilege , we must be well - nourished spiritually .
Could you more often meditate on what you read ? ​ — Ps .
Another pioneer said , “ When I familiarize myself with the publications that I am going to offer , I become enthusiastic about using them . ”
Doing so helps them to give their best to Jehovah . ​ — Col .
However , the brother conducting the meeting for field service should take sufficient time to discuss or demonstrate a simple presentation that is well - suited to the territory or to consider other practical information that can be used in the ministry that day .
The Power of Listening
Give examples .
So I decided to invite them in with the intention of demolishing their arguments . . . .
In time , this woman accepted a Bible study .
Jehovah has dignified us by giving us free will .
As his ministers , we should be ready to present the good news in a manner worthy of our merciful God each time we give a witness .
What can help us to meet this challenge ?
( b ) What can help us focus on finding deserving ones ?
Jesus instructed his followers not to become unduly concerned if some rejected the message but rather to focus on finding deserving ones .
It warns the ungodly that “ the hour of the judgment by [ God ] has arrived . ”
• What can help us to start Bible discussions in the house - to - house ministry ?
▪ After you greet the householder , you might hand him a tract and say , “ My purpose in visiting today is to share an encouraging thought on this important subject . ”
That is how the apostle Paul described the privilege all of us can enjoy .
( Read 1 Corinthians 3 : 5 - 9 . )
Why does the fact that ‘ God makes it grow ’ help us to have a proper view of our ministry ?
What similarity exists between the work of sowing literal seed and that of making disciples ?
Many factors are beyond our control .
In Bible times , the sowing of seed was generally done by broadcasting .
Rather , he speaks of one type of seed that lands on different types of soil , each of which produces a different result .
It is the Kingdom message found in God’s Word .
The Responsibility of Those Who Hear the Word
Is their response predetermined ?
But this does not have to happen .
How can they avoid this ?
13 : 5 .
Even though some who respond to the word have a good heart condition and bear fruit , what they are able to do in proclaiming the good news varies according to their circumstances .
For example , advanced age or enfeebling illness may limit the share that some have in the preaching work .
( Compare Mark 12 : 43 , 44 . )
15 , 16 .
What truth about literal and spiritual growth did Jesus bring out in his illustration of the sower ?
The wording used in this verse indicates an ongoing process of working by day and sleeping by night over a period of time .
They symbolize their dedication by water baptism .
Kingdom fruitage is reaped by the original sower as well as by other Kingdom proclaimers who may not personally have been involved with sowing the seed that produced that particular disciple .
Lessons for Us Today
We can clearly see that we have a work to do ​ — sowing .
How comforting it is to know that our success is measured by our faithfulness to Jehovah and to the privilege that he has granted us to preach the “ good news of the kingdom . . . for a witness to all the nations . ” ​ — Matt .
We will analyze some of these illustrations in the next article .
However , it should be noted that in Jesus ’ illustration the seed does not change into bad seed or rotten fruit .

You Do Not Know Where It Will Have Success !
A FARMER needs to be patient .
Gradually , when conditions are favorable , shoots begin to appear , breaking through the surface of the ground .
Eventually , the farmer has a field ready to be harvested .
How humbling , too , to realize who is the Source of this growth .
Let us now consider three more of Jesus ’ illustrations ​ — the mustard grain , the leaven , and the dragnet .
The Illustration of the Mustard Grain
Like a mustard grain , which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds that are on the earth ​ — but when it has been sown , it comes up and becomes greater than all other vegetables and produces great branches , so that the birds of the heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow . ” ​ — Mark 4 : 30 - 32 .
( Compare Luke 17 : 6 . )
Since the establishment of God’s Kingdom in heaven in 1914 , the branches of the mustard “ tree ” have expanded beyond expectations .
God’s people have seen the literal fulfillment of the prophecy recorded by Isaiah : “ The little one himself will become a thousand , and the small one a mighty nation . ”
11 : 9 .
( a ) Whom do the birds in Jesus ’ illustration represent ?
( Compare Isaiah 32 : 1 , 2 . )
The Illustration of the Leaven
He says : “ The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three large measures of flour , until the whole mass was fermented . ”
The apostle Paul referred to leaven in this way when speaking of the corrupting influence of a sinner in the congregation in ancient Corinth .
This meal was one of cheerfulness . ​ — Lev .
But at Revelation 5 : 5 , Jesus is likened to a lion ​ — “ the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah . ”
He simply referred to the normal process of making bread .
Thus , the leavening process was hidden from the view of the housewife .
Jesus said that “ the seed sprouts and grows tall , just how [ the man ] does not know . ”
What aspect of the preaching work is illustrated by the fact that the leaven ferments the whole mass ?
Does this separating refer to the final judgment of the sheep and the goats that Jesus said would occur when he arrived in his glory ?
That final judgment will occur at Jesus ’ coming during the great tribulation .
Some attend the Memorial , others come to our meetings , and still others are happy to study the Bible .
20 , 21 . ( a ) What have we learned from reviewing Jesus ’ illustrations concerning growth ?
Second , it is God who makes it grow .
Just as the hidden leaven spread through the whole mass , this growth has not always been readily discernible or understood , but spread it does !
Does this mean that everyone who has stopped studying or associating with Jehovah’s people has been thrown away as unsuitable by the angels ?
No !

We Were Not Afraid ​ — Jehovah Was With Us
In 1972 , the Witnesses throughout Cyprus gathered in Nicosia to hear a special talk by Nathan H .
Knorr , who had long taken the lead in the ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He recognized me right away , and even before I had a chance to introduce myself , he asked : “ Do you have any news from Egypt ? ”
I had met Brother Knorr 20 years earlier in my hometown of Alexandria , Egypt .
I WAS born in Alexandria on January 23 , 1914 , the eldest of four children .
Alexandria was then a beautiful cosmopolitan city , renowned for its architecture and history .
I was also very religious and loved to read the Bible , even though I understood little of what I read .
About that time ​ — in the mid - 1930 ’ s — ​ I met a fine young man , a native of Cyprus .
Often he serenaded me from below my window with romantic Greek songs .
We were married on June 30 , 1940 .
Theodotos ’ secret was out .
I was taken aback .
In 1939 , World War II began , and it soon escalated .
Then Theodotos was asked to care for his employer’s new confectionery parlor in Port Taufiq , near Suez , so we moved there .
Stavros enjoyed studying the Bible so much that he would turn all the clocks in his house back one hour so that we would miss the last train home and have to stay longer .
Once again , we felt how Jehovah encouraged us through upbuilding association with mature Christian friends .
Thus our older son , John , developed a love for Bible truth , and while he was still in his mid - teens , he began to pioneer .
Our son James was only four .
What were we to do ?
In 1960 we had to leave Egypt with just one suitcase each .
We moved to Cyprus , my husband’s island home .
Cared for During Difficult Times
Eventually , James married , and he and his wife served as pioneers until the first of their four children was born .
At the same time , though , we rejoiced to see an increase in the number of Kingdom publishers in Cyprus .
I find comfort when I hear news of those whom Theodotos and I were privileged to help .
Many of their children and grandchildren are in the full - time ministry ​ — some serving in Australia , Canada , England , Greece , and Switzerland .

2 : 3 - 5 .
Likewise , we should not permit unusual circumstances to hold us back from declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom .
Marriage mates ought to be careful not to get so absorbed in each other that Kingdom interests take second place in their lives .
Scriptural Questions Answered :
What the apostle envisioned was likely the spiritual paradise enjoyed by the Christian congregation in “ the time of the end . ” ​ — Dan .
4 : 16 .
A young Christian mother may express such sentiments because she feels overwhelmed by the constant attention demanded by her newborn child and is frustrated that she cannot pay more attention to spiritual interests .
How have some Christians been able to cultivate a realistic view of their circumstances ?
The apostle Paul gives us a key to maintaining our joy when he says : “ Always rejoice in the Lord . Once more I will say , Rejoice !
To experience joy and satisfaction in our service to God , we need to cultivate reasonable expectations in the light of our own abilities and circumstances .
On the other hand , we should be careful not to become too lenient with ourselves , using our perceived limitations as an excuse for slowing down more than is necessary in the Christian ministry .
In addition , we would deprive ourselves of the deep satisfaction , true joy , and other rich blessings that come from whole - souled service . ​ — Prov .
The word also conveys the sense of not being overly strict .
So , then , if we are reasonable , we will be able to take a balanced look at our circumstances .
To have a reasonable view of our limitations can be more challenging if we have been brought up by overly demanding parents .
Jehovah loves us for the wholehearted way in which we render our service to him .
He knows our limitations and loves us when we serve him zealously in spite of them .
If that is true in your case , why not seek the help of an experienced Christian who knows you well ?
That is an excellent goal !
For instance , he could suggest that she get some rest before starting a new month of increased activities .
This may build up her energy and help her to preserve her joy in the ministry .
He was privileged to serve for two weeks every year at the temple .
However , when the sailor at the helm encounters a fierce storm , he is forced to adjust the sails .
He is not in control of the storm , but by making adjustments , he may remain in control of his sailboat .
In a comparable way , often we have no control over adverse stormlike circumstances that we encounter in life .
Or if a mother is unable to share in the house - to - house ministry because her child is unwell , she may find it practical to invite a Christian sister to her home to share with her in witnessing by telephone while the child is having a nap .
You can determine how much you can prepare and do that as well as possible .
Adjusting our goals may require determination and effort .
Serge notes : “ We feel very useful in the congregation . ”
We thus rejoice over what we can accomplish , even if it is relatively modest . ​ — Gal .
As we cultivate balance in what we expect of ourselves , we will become more considerate of fellow Christians .
Remember , as a loving Father , Jehovah never asks more of us than we can give .
[ Picture on page 30 ]
Serge and Agnès benefited from setting new goals
Paul speaks not just for himself but also for “ us ” ​ — that is , for all who serve God loyally .
To emphasize his point , Paul lists a number of things that cannot prevent Jehovah’s love from reaching his devoted servants .
Meanwhile , God’s love for his loyal worshippers remains constant no matter what life in this system of things may bring them .
Neither can governments , which may oppose true Christians , alter God’s view of his servants . ​ — 1 Corinthians 4 : 13 .
The Greek word used here is broad in meaning .
“ Nor height nor depth . ”
Jehovah loves his people regardless of the circumstances ​ — high or low — ​ in which they find themselves .
“ Nor any other creation . ”
Knowing this surely moves us to draw closer to Jehovah and to try our best to prove our love for him .
Keys to Family Happiness
you ask your son .
“ What happened at school today ? ”
Ramón , in Mexico , observes something similar with his 16 - year - old son .
That last aspect can pose a challenge for adolescents , for upon entering puberty even the most outgoing child can suddenly turn timid .
Experts say that adolescents typically feel that they are always onstage before an imaginary audience , constantly under the glare of an unforgiving spotlight .
Rather than face the spotlight , self - conscious adolescents may pull the curtain down , so to speak , and retreat into a private world that parents cannot easily enter .
On the contrary , surveys indicate that even when adolescents say otherwise , they value the advice of their parents more than that of their friends .
How , though , can you make sure that the door of communication remains open ?
Imagine that you are driving on a long , straight highway .
To keep your car on the road , you have no choice but to adjust your steering .
‘ When my son or daughter is ready to open up , am I ready to communicate ? ’
Seize that opportunity .
‘ Do I discern the message behind the words ? ’
For instance , “ You always treat me like a child ” could mean “ I feel that you don’t trust me , ” and “ You never listen to me ” might mean “ I want to tell you how I really feel . ”
Try to discern the message behind the words .
By your words and demeanor , create “ peaceful conditions ” so that your adolescent will feel inclined to talk .
Communicating with adolescents is not an impossible task .

Are you kind even when people are unkind to you ?
A husband must love his wife as his own body .
Jesus set the example for husbands .
So that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
Therefore , what God has yoked together let no man put apart . . . .
Although Jesus was perfect and his parents were imperfect , as a child he obeyed them .
[ Picture on page 17 ]
DO YOU ever see others do bad things ? ​ — * Samuel did .
He lived where you would not expect such things to happen .
What do you think their father should have done ? — Yes , he should have disciplined them and not allowed them to do those bad things .
Eli’s reply was : “ What is good in his [ Jehovah’s ] eyes let him do . ”
If you do , you will make both Jehovah and your parents happy .
If you are reading with children , the dash provides a reminder to stop and direct the question to them .
What challenges did Samuel face there ?
Although the Bible does not indicate whether this was the case , it is interesting to note that there is no mention of an interpreter being used for this conversation . ​ — John 18 : 28 - 40 .
By the time that Jesus was on earth , King Herod had doubled the size of the Temple Mount as compared to that of Solomon’s time .
[ Picture on page 26 ]
Temple stones thrown down outside the temple mount , Jerusalem
1 , 2 . ( a ) What developments in the tenth century B.C.E . tested the loyalty of God’s servants ?
Their newly appointed king , Jeroboam , quickly moves to consolidate his power by establishing a new State religion .
12 : 1 - 33 ; 2 Chron .
11 : 13 , 14 .
Can we successfully “ take [ our ] stand against him , solid in the faith ” ?
David was not perfect , but he was loyal to God and trusted in him .
6 : 11 - 13 .
Gradually , Solomon ceased to obey Jehovah’s laws and became increasingly oppressive .
Jehovah told Solomon : “ For the reason that . . . you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I laid in command upon you , I shall without fail rip the kingdom away from off you , and I shall certainly give it to your servant . ” ​ — 1 Ki .
Although Solomon was rejected , how did Jehovah care for His loyal ones ?
Jehovah acted in behalf of his people and provided a way of bringing them relief from oppression .
Oppression and injustices abound today .
“ Man has dominated man to his injury , ” states Ecclesiastes 8 : 9 .
Greedy commerce and corrupt rulership may result in harsh economic conditions .
3 : 1 - 5 , 12 .
Just think of the steps he has already taken to replace the world’s corrupt rulers .
Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven for close to a hundred years .
Soon he will bring complete relief to those fearing God’s name .
Jesus has already proved himself loyal to God to the point of death .
( a ) How can we show that we appreciate God’s Kingdom ?
With full confidence in the Kingdom , we repudiate the world’s ungodliness and zealously pursue fine works .
We strive to remain without spot from this world .
( Read Psalm 97 : 10 . )
Jehovah’s servants are so precious to him that he will not allow them to perish as a group .
While Exposed to Apostate Influences
How did Jeroboam become disloyal ?
Instead , his actions further tested their loyalty to God .
So Jeroboam established a new religion centered on two golden calves .
Like their faithful forefathers , the Levites living in cities given to them in the territory of the northern kingdom lost no time in reacting .
Jehovah saw to it that the way back to true worship was kept open so that in later generations others from the northern kingdom could abandon calf worship and return to Judah . ​ — 2 Chron .
2 : 9 ; Rev .
14 : 1 - 5 .
Like the faithful Levites back in the tenth century B.C.E . , God’s loyal ones today are not deceived by apostate ideas .
Why does “ the faithful and discreet slave ” deserve our loyalty ?
With hearts full of gratitude , we stay close to “ the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics , to give them their food at the proper time . ”
Christ has appointed this slave “ over all his belongings . ”
Therefore , even if we as individuals do not fully understand a certain position taken by the slave class , that is no reason for us to reject it or return to Satan’s world .
He assigned a prophet from Judah to travel north to Bethel and appear before Jeroboam while he was officiating at his altar .
The prophet was to deliver a devastating judgment message to Jeroboam .
13 : 1 - 3 .
Jeroboam was forced to ask the prophet to soften the face of Jehovah and pray that the dried - up hand be restored .
13 : 4 - 6 .
But we must never allow the fear of rejection to dampen our zeal for the ministry .
( Read John 14 : 15 - 17 ; Revelation 14 : 6 . )
He is “ loyal in all his works . ”
[ Footnote ]
Whether the prophet continues to obey Jehovah or not and what happens to him will be discussed in the following article .
• How should we respond to apostates and their ideas ?
• How does Jehovah guard his loyal ones as they engage in the Christian ministry ?
86 : 11 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) According to Psalm 86 : 2 , 11 , what will help us to remain faithful to Jehovah in the face of tests or temptations ?
How vital it is that we cultivate heartfelt loyalty to Jehovah now , before tests or temptations come upon us !
“ Let Me Give You a Gift ”
How did Jeroboam react to the judgment message delivered by God’s prophet ?
The man of God has just delivered a stinging message to King Jeroboam , who had set up calf worship in the northern ten - tribe kingdom of Israel .
The king becomes furious .
Or should he reject the king’s invitation , even though the king appears to be remorseful ?
If God’s prophet has harbored any secret desire for material things , the king’s offer is likely to be a huge temptation .
Materialism may not seem to be an issue of loyalty , but it is .
( Read Philippians 4 : 11 - 13 . )
What “ gifts ” might be offered to us , and what will help us to decide whether to accept them ?
But before we act on them , should we not examine our motives ?
He warned : “ Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness , because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses . ”
Things would have gone well with God’s prophet if he had continued on his journey back home .
When the man of the true God declines the invitation , the old man replies : “ I too am a prophet like you , and an angel himself spoke to me by the word of Jehovah , saying , ‘ Have him come back with you to your house that he may eat bread and drink water . ’ ”
13 : 11 - 18 .
The prophet from Judah should have been able to see through the ruse of the old prophet .
What a tragic end to his prophetic career ! ​ — 1 Ki .
*
What good example did Ahijah set ?
The elder may preface his remarks by acknowledging that he is not in a position to tell the brother how to support his family .
Proverbs 3 : 5 states : “ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding . ”
His mistake cost him his life and his good name with God .
We might grow weary of some aspect of sacred service and begin to feel that we have done enough over the years , thinking that perhaps it is time for others to carry the load .
Whenever we find ourselves in such situations , we would be wise to ask Jehovah to help us .
Nevertheless , some did remain loyal to Jehovah .
[ Footnote ]
The Bible does not say whether Jehovah brought about the death of the old prophet .
Daniel wrote : “ I kept on beholding until there were thrones placed and the Ancient of Days sat down . His clothing was white just like snow , and the hair of his head was like clean wool . ” ​ — Dan .
Jehovah and “ the faithful and discreet slave ” deeply appreciate all their past and present contributions to the Kingdom work . ​ — Matt .
In fact , God’s Law given through Moses links consideration and respect for the elderly with the fear of Jehovah .
*
Show Tender Regard in Practical Ways
Why should congregations show their concern for aging Christians ?
Their concern for older congregation members is well - illustrated by Paul when he points out that if one member of the human body suffers , “ all the other members suffer with it . ”
What burdens do older ones bear ?
They may feel that doing even basic things ​ — going to the doctor , doing paperwork , cleaning the house , preparing food — ​ is beyond their capacity .
Loving brothers and sisters help them with shopping , cooking , and cleaning .
After the wife of one older brother died , he could no longer afford to pay the rent without her pension .
This elderly brother lived with them until he died at age 89 .
They have not ‘ lost their reward ’ for having helped a fellow disciple of Jesus Christ . ​ — Matt .
You can also invite them to your home and include them when you go on outings .
Lowering her head , she said through her tears , “ I’m not doing anything anymore . ”
What encouragement can older servants of Jehovah draw from the psalms ?
( Read Psalm 68 : 19 . )
Endeavor to replace depressing , pessimistic thoughts with positive ones .
*
Consider Johan , who at 80 years of age cares full - time for his faithful , now invalid , wife , Sannie .
They urged him to continue serving as an elder , even if his participation was limited .
The apostle Paul , who may have been dealing with a physical affliction , ‘ did not give up , even if the man he was on the outside was wasting away . ’ ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 4 : 16 - 18 .
Many modern - day examples prove that older ones can “ keep on thriving . ”
But the challenges of illness and old age can be daunting , even for those who have caring and committed family members to help them .
Caregivers too may become worn - out .
The congregation has the privilege and responsibility to put their love into action in behalf of older ones and those who care for them .
2 : 15 - 17 . Why can faithful elderly Christians view the future with confidence ?
On the contrary , all of these faithful Christians are precious in his eyes , and he will never leave them .
Names have been changed .
How Would You Answer ?
• Why do you consider faithful elderly Christians to be precious ?
[ Pictures on page 18 ]
“ I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language , in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah . ” ​ — ZEPH .
3 : 9 .
What a wonderful gift this has proved to be !
Why do humans no longer speak one common language ?
So Jehovah confused the original language of those rebels and caused them to speak various tongues .
Thus , they were scattered over all the surface of the earth . ​ — Read Genesis 11 : 4 - 8 .
What happened when Jehovah confused the speech of the rebels at Babel ?
Through his prophet Zephaniah , Jehovah foretold : “ Then I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language , in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah , in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder . ”
The pure language is the truth about Jehovah God and his purposes as found in his Word , the Bible .
That “ language ” includes a correct understanding of the truth about God’s Kingdom and how it will sanctify Jehovah’s name , vindicate his sovereignty , and bring eternal blessings to faithful mankind .
What results from this change of language ?
Pronunciation of new sounds will require a different use of the speech organs , such as the tongue .
What will help us not only to understand the pure language but also to speak it fluently ?
In a similar way , we are admonished : “ It is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us , that we may never drift away . ”
Listening requires concentration , but the effort is truly worthwhile .
When at Christian meetings , do we find ourselves concentrating on what is being explained , or are we distracted ?
It is vital that we do our utmost to concentrate on what is being presented .
Imitate fluent speakers .
Students of a new language are encouraged not only to listen carefully but also to try to imitate , or mimic , the pronunciation and speech patterns of fluent speakers .
Be willing to accept correction when you make mistakes . ​ — Read Hebrews 12 : 5 , 6 , 11 .
If we persist in doing this , it will result in unity among God’s people , allowing them to speak , as it were , with the same accent . ​ — 1 Cor .
Some have made it a goal to memorize the wording of a certain number of Bible texts or citations .
Could we make better use of this valuable skill ?
The apostle Peter said : “ I shall be disposed always to remind you of these things , although you know them and are firmly set in the truth that is present in you . ”
Why do we need reminders ?
Constantly reviewing God’s standards and principles helps us scrutinize ourselves and counteracts the tendency to be “ a forgetful hearer . ”
What will help us when we are studying the pure language ?
Read aloud .
In Hebrew , the expression “ to read in an undertone ” is closely related to meditation .
At some point , it is beneficial to study the grammar , or word patterns and rules , of a new language that we are learning .
Just as a language has a pattern of words , the pure language of Scriptural truth has “ the pattern of healthful words . ”
Continue to make progress .
What can help us to overcome this tendency ?
6 : 1 , 2 .
Shorter study periods on a regular basis are better than longer periods held spasmodically .
Study at times when you are alert and not easily distracted .
6 : 18 .
How grateful we are that no matter what language we normally speak , we are all united in speaking the pure language of Bible truth !

In the Bible , the Hebrew word for “ dignity ” can also be translated “ splendor , ” “ majesty , ” “ glory , ” and “ honor . ”
According to one dictionary definition , “ dignity ” is “ the quality or state of being worthy , honored , or esteemed . ”
Why , though , can humans act with dignity ?
How are Jehovah’s dignity and splendor made evident ?
How should we be affected by God’s dignity ?
What can Jesus Christ teach us about displaying this quality ?
Because they are made in God’s image , all humans have the capacity to act with dignity .
What evidence of Jehovah’s dignity and splendor do we see in the heavens ?
Yet , Jehovah “ is counting the number of the stars ; all of them he calls by their names . ”
How does the provision of bread magnify our Creator’s wisdom ?
Though bread is considered a simple food , the chemical process that transforms a few basic ingredients into delicious bread is anything but simple .
Leaven , or yeast , was sometimes used in the bread - making process .
These simple substances combine to form an astonishing number of chemical compounds that have active links to one another .
Moreover , the way bread is digested in the body is another amazingly intricate process .
How Are You Affected by God’s Dignity and Splendor ?
Reflecting on God’s creative works can have what effect on us ?
Surely , then , we are moved to join David in honoring Jehovah and saying : “ As for your greatness , I will declare it . ”
Are you zealously declaring the good news and helping people to appreciate the dignity , splendor , and majesty of Jehovah God ?
( b ) As King , how does Jesus treat his subjects ?
Consider one example of how Jesus as King - Designate treated the people he met , especially the unwanted and the seemingly unlovable .
( Read Mark 1 : 40 - 42 . )
He reached out , touched the leper , and healed him .
One way is by appreciating that all humans ​ — regardless of status , health , or age — ​ deserve due honor and respect .
Stressing that this is a requirement for all Christians , the Bible states : “ In brotherly love have tender affection for one another . In showing honor to one another take the lead . ” ​ — Rom .
Displaying Dignity in Worship
19 , 20 . ( a ) What is a fine way to dignify others ?
Let us always show deep respect for him , for his worship , and for our fellow worshippers .

Missionaries Are Compared to Locusts
UPON hearing that some Christians were being deflected from pure worship by Judaizers , the apostle Paul writes a powerful letter “ to the congregations of Galatia . ”
He strongly admonishes the Galatians : “ Stand fast , and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery . ” ​ — Gal .

EVERY six months , the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead holds a graduation program to which the entire United States Bethel family is invited .
All 6,411 in attendance rejoiced with the students on their special day .
It was based on the Bible example of Aquila and Priscilla ( or , Prisca ) , a first - century Christian married couple .
God’s goodness and love can become in us a driving force to do good things for others .
Like the lyrics of a song , the actions of every Christian eventually become known to others .

Surely it is the course of wisdom to try to find out what is at the end of any road before we take the first step along it .
Perhaps you too have said , ‘ If only I had known how this was going to turn out , I would never have started it in the first place . ’
So before you take the first step down any road , it is wise to seek Jehovah’s advice , as did King David of ancient Israel , who prayed : “ Make known to me the way in which I should walk . ” ​ — Psalm 32 : 8 ; 143 : 8 .
What Will Be Their Future ?
He meditated on the prospects of those whom he envied .
What would be their future ?
He realized that such people were “ on slippery ground ” and would be “ brought to their finish through sudden terrors ! ”
What of the path that the psalmist himself was taking ?
Reflecting on the consequences of the actions of those who achieve prosperity through expedient or questionable dealings reassured the psalmist that he was on the right path .
Keeping close to Jehovah God always results in lasting benefits . ​ — Psalm 73 : 28 .
What are the likely consequences ?
Will you be required to be away from home , potentially creating stress for your spouse or for yourself ?
By taking a close look at the road ahead , you will be able to make a wise decision .
What occurred was exactly as described in the Bible : “ All of a sudden he is going after her , like a bull that comes even to the slaughter . ”
If only he had considered the “ end afterward ” ! ​ — Proverbs 7 : 22 , 23 .
The nation was at a crossroads , and Jehovah God advised them : “ Ask for the roadways of long ago , where , now , the good way is ; and walk in it . ”
What was the “ end afterward ” of their rebellious course ?
In 607 B.C.E . , the Babylonians came and completely destroyed the city of Jerusalem and took its inhabitants to Babylon as captives .
But ignoring “ Do Not Enter ” signs that should regulate moral conduct can lead only to disaster .
Just pausing to contemplate the potential “ end afterward ” may suffice to prevent you from taking a course that can have serious consequences .
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted pregnancies , abortions , ruined relationships , and guilty consciences litter the path of those who have chosen to ignore such signposts .
The end of the road for those practicing immorality is clearly stated by the apostle Paul .
Sometimes it is difficult to see where a path is taking us .
Is it the right one ?
Consult the ‘ road map , ’ the Bible .
So before taking your next step down the path of life , ask yourself , ‘ What is going to be the “ end afterward ” ? ’
Nonetheless , one Tuesday morning , I began my journey to attend a Christian assembly in Wamblán , a small town in northern Nicaragua .
I set off at dawn , driving my old but sturdy truck along the smooth Pan - American Highway .
Through the mist , I saw trees lined with orchids and draped with Spanish moss .
On a hairpin turn , I narrowly missed an oncoming bus that hogged the road .
The sun blazed as I approached Wiwilí and caught my first sight of the river Coco .
At last , the track ended , and there in deep shadow in a wooded valley was Wamblán , my destination .
Outhouses of shiny tin sat on concrete slabs .
People smiled and spoke to me warmly .
We chatted above the noise of local traffic ​ — the clip - clop of horses and mules .
Saturday arrived .
Yet , the audience listened with rapt attention to the counsel and guidance given .
They followed along as the speakers read Bible texts , they sang the songs based on Bible themes , and they listened respectfully to the prayers being offered on their behalf .
I showed them images of stars and galaxies on my computer .
All too soon the assembly ended , and everyone had to go home .
2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4
In verse 3 , God is called “ the Father of tender mercies . ”
The Greek word rendered “ tender mercies ” can convey the idea of feeling compassion for the sufferings of others .
Paul tells us that God lovingly gives us His Word so that “ through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope . ”
To what extent does Jehovah comfort his people ?
Paul says that God “ comforts us in all our tribulation . ”

What kind of attitude do you think Jesus reflected when he asked : “ Why did you have to go looking for me ? ”
WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU LEARNED ABOUT . . .
WHAT ASPECTS OF THIS BIBLE ACCOUNT DID YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL , AND WHY ?
IT WAS THE MORNING OF APRIL 16 , 2007 . As I crouched in a corner of a third - floor office in Norris Hall on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University , or Virginia Tech , I was once again reminded of how grateful we should be for each precious day of life that we have .
A professor came by to ask me to go to his office to help him with a computer problem .
As we waited , an event of 15 years earlier flashed through my mind .
I was working as a mechanic in an auto shop .
It also reinforced my determination to use my life in the service of the one who gave me that life , Jehovah God ​ — as one of his Witnesses . ​ — Psalm 90 : 12 ; Isaiah 43 : 10 .
This harrowing experience has taught me how fleeting and uncertain life is .

Sadly , before long the divine institution of marriage came under attack .
How is the marriage arrangement under attack today ?
Homosexual unions , unmarried couples living together , and easy divorces prove that he is having much success in this regard .
For a marriage to thrive , Jehovah needs to be involved in the relationship .
( b ) What does one sister value about her husband ?
Marriage mates should also strive to strengthen their partner’s love for God . ​ — Prov .
Indeed , a husband and wife must work hard in order to obtain “ a good reward ” in the form of a loving and lasting union that has God’s blessing .
Clearly , the spirit of independence is now seen in many marriages .
12 : 4 .
He adds , “ Doing things together , especially spiritual things , draws mates much closer to each other and to Jehovah . ”
King David said : “ To you the eyes of all look hopefully . ”
At our meetings , couples learn how to combat the “ crafty acts ” that Satan is using to divide families .
Granted , the above suggestions may not sound new or original , but why not openly discuss them with your mate ?
See if some area merits additional attention in your marriage .
Indeed , when tragedies or other difficult circumstances arise , the ensuing emotional turmoil can cause one to act irrationally .
With love and patience , you may be able to help your mate to make gradual improvement .
Do not forget , though , that Jesus likened one who picks at another’s minor failings to someone who sees a “ straw ” in his brother’s eye but fails to notice a “ rafter ” in his own eye .
Jesus urged us : “ Stop judging that you may not be judged . ”

Aging parents may need special care .
If the strain on your marriage makes you feel that you have reached the breaking point , what can you do ?
The Bible contains many accounts of ones who remained faithful despite severe trials .
What blessings come from keeping God in one’s marriage ?
The blessings that result from having God in a marriage are many .
“ We have always endeavored to show kindness , patience , and love to each other . ”
IN THE year 1911 , British authorities passed a law designed to save the lives of coal miners .
This early warning was vital .
In a spiritual sense , Christians face a situation similar to the mine workers .
3 , 4 .
What warning did Jesus give his disciples , and why should that interest us ?
Happily , though , Jesus also promised that his Father would provide holy spirit to refresh their memories and to help them stay awake and be strong . ​ — John 14 : 26 .
If so , what must we do to receive it ?
5 , 6 .
What can holy spirit do for us , but what must we do to receive it ?
( Read Luke 11 : 13 . )
How does the spirit of the world influence individuals ?
As is evidenced all around us today , it encourages rebellion against God’s standards .
However , the opposite is also possible .
What are some warning signs that we might be succumbing to the spirit of the world ?
In a spiritual sense , what are some early warning signs signaling that we are being influenced by the spirit of the world ?
We likely prayed fervently and often .
Of course , we may have many demands upon our time and energy , and it can be challenging to maintain a healthy spiritual routine .
Will we now make a strong effort to revive the good habits we once had ?
“ Never Become Weighed Down ”
“ Pay attention to yourselves , ” he said , “ that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life , and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare . ” ​ — Luke 21 : 34 , 35 .
13 , 14 .
Yet , Jesus knew that the spirit of the world promotes a lack of self - control in those areas .
How can we be sure that the world’s spirit has not poisoned our senses as to the dangers of overeating or heavy drinking ?
Another vital step in resisting the spirit of the world involves managing anxiety .
He lovingly said to his disciples : “ Stop being anxious . ”
Those duped by this propaganda will slave to gain riches and are constantly anxious about acquiring the newest , the biggest , the most advanced products .
We do all within our power to honor our financial commitments , letting our “ Yes mean Yes ” when it comes to paying off debts .
Thus , the apostle Paul reminds us of the need to guard our thinking .
8 : 6 .
She pours out her heart to Jehovah .
Yes , when faced with severe trials or hardships , God’s worshippers naturally turn to him for help .
This stirring psalm was written by David , a loyal worshipper of Jehovah who faced many difficult trials and challenges during his life .
Psalm 70 begins and ends with an urgent cry for God’s help .
What do we learn about David from Psalm 70 , and what confidence can we have ?
Like David , we can have full confidence that Jehovah is our Helper and “ the Provider of escape ” for us .
What helped David to know that Jehovah provides the righteous with escape ?
When Jehovah brought the Deluge upon an ungodly world , he preserved alive Noah and his God - fearing family .
When Jehovah destroyed proud Pharaoh and his military forces in the Red Sea , He kept his people safe , thus helping them to escape a terrible end .
7 - 9 . ( a ) What reason did David have for placing his trust in God’s saving power ?
David had experienced firsthand that Jehovah’s “ everlasting arms ” can deliver those who serve Him .
Consider an example .
( Read 1 Samuel 18 : 11 - 14 . )
Later , when Saul’s scheme to have David killed by the Philistines failed , “ Saul got to see and know that Jehovah was with David . ” ​ — 1 Sam .
My God is my rock .
Confined for a time to a sickbed , David was so ill that it seemed to some of his enemies that he would never “ get up again . ”
12 , 13 . ( a ) What confidence did David express ?
Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness ; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness . ”
Rather , David felt certain that Jehovah would “ sustain him ” ​ — that is , give him support and strength while he was lying on his sickbed .
Jehovah may well have strengthened David by bringing to his mind comforting thoughts .
David may also have found strength in reflecting on the fact that despite his weakened condition and the bad things that his enemies were saying , Jehovah regarded him as a man of integrity .
David did finally recover from his sickness .
1 : 3 .
Supplied With Sustenance
When he became king of Israel , David could enjoy the best of food and drink and even invite many others to dine at his table .
Recognizing the plight of David and his men , these three loyal subjects brought much needed supplies , including beds , wheat , barley , roasted grain , broad beans , lentils , honey , butter , and sheep .
David was convinced that Jehovah cares for his people .
“ Jehovah Knows How to Deliver People ”
What has Jehovah time and again demonstrated ?
Since David’s time , God has time and again demonstrated the truthfulness of the apostle Peter’s words : “ Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial . ”
How did Jehovah provide deliverance in Hezekiah’s day ?
Jehovah answered Hezekiah’s prayer
SHADOWS created by the sun do not remain still .
The Creator of earth and sun , however , does not change .
As we noted in the preceding article , Jehovah proved to be “ the Provider of escape ” in Bible times .
How has Jehovah provided escape for his servants in modern times ?
Why can we be sure that opposers will not stop Jehovah’s people from preaching the good news ?
No amount of satanic opposition will ever prevent Jehovah’s Witnesses from giving Jehovah the exclusive worship that he deserves .
God’s Word assures us : “ Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success , and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn . ”
F .
During the persecution , our brothers carried on the preaching work underground .
After the collapse of the Nazi regime , they used their freedom to continue preaching .
Today , there are over 165,000 Kingdom publishers in Germany .
What about today ?

What , though , about Jehovah ?
By sincerely praying for his spirit , we will receive help to resist the temptation to engage in questionable conduct .

A few days after their daughter , Theresa , was reported missing , they received devastating news : She had been murdered .
I have found peace in knowing that her future life prospects are in his loving hands . ”
that discuss our particular health problem .
Consider the young brother referred to at the beginning of the preceding article .
In 1998 , he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS , which finally left him totally paralyzed .
He explains : “ I have had moments of pain and frustration when I have felt that death would be my only means of escape .
Whenever I feel overwhelmed , I pray that Jehovah give me three things : a calm heart , patience , and endurance .
A calm heart lets me reflect on comforting thoughts , such as what it will be like in the new world when I will be able to walk , enjoy a tasty meal , and talk with my family again .
Endurance enables me to keep faithful and not lose my spiritual balance .
35 : 5 , 6 .
Jehovah promises to care for us materially .
( Read Matthew 6 : 33 , 34 and Hebrews 13 : 5 , 6 . )
Relate an experience that shows that we may be provided for in times of need .
She explains : “ I would go out in the field service in the morning , and I would spend every afternoon looking for work .
I remember one day when I went to the grocery store to buy some milk .
This sister soon learned that the bags had been left by a brother in the congregation who grew the vegetables in his garden .
She later wrote to him : “ Even though I thanked you very much that day , I also thanked Jehovah for using your kindness to remind me of his love . ” ​ — Prov .
Soon , when the great tribulation comes upon Satan’s world , we will need Jehovah’s help as never before .

Desiring to have such , we are eager to improve the quality of our faith and to render sacred service zealously .
The Key to Faith
Paul encourages us to render sacred service to God with our “ power of reason ” and to ‘ make our mind over . ’
All day long it is my concern . ” ​ — Ps .
Ewa remarks : “ I constantly try to improve the quality of my personal study .
Consider , too , the examples of Wojciech and Małgorzata , who have considerable family obligations .
How do they manage to fit personal Bible study into their schedule ?
Study With a Receptive Mind
For example , could you make it a point to mention to your mate or to a Christian friend things that you have read or learned during your study periods ?
Some have long enjoyed studying deeply , becoming absorbed in spiritual matters .
How Can I Find the Time ?
It is stimulating to use your imagination while you are reading the Bible .
It will be easier to maintain the habit of reading the Bible every day .
Why not sit down together for a relaxed discussion of the potential benefits of family study ?
Or perhaps your discussion will reveal the need to adjust the family schedule .
Deep study of God’s Word can bear “ fruit in every good work . ”
Above all , you will draw closer to Jehovah .

Imitate Jesus ​ — Render Acceptable Worship to God
Thus , Jesus could confidently point the way to true worship .
Jesus demonstrated a personal attachment to his Father by being obedient to Him , doing His will , even when it involved great personal hardship .
His self - sacrificing spirit left him little time for himself , but he was happy to minister to others .
The Struggle to Please God Well
However , Satan the Devil also noticed Jesus ’ faithful life course .
And the Devil wanted to stop Jesus from rendering the worship that Jehovah so rightly deserved . ​ — Rev .
In our case , Satan may not offer us all the kingdoms of the world and their glory in exchange for our worship .
4 : 4 .
By maintaining his integrity to God , Jesus glorified Jehovah in a way that no other human had .
Blessings From Rendering Acceptable Worship
Try to imagine what a joy it will be when he welcomes you as a guest in his tent , supplying you with his protective care so that no harm will befall you !
Moreover , all who render worship acceptable to God are described as being guided to “ fountains of waters of life . ”
For all the nations will come and worship before you , because your righteous decrees have been made manifest . ” ​ — Rev .
Why ?
Today , the marketplace may be a shopping center or a mall .
For example , at a shopping mall in New Jersey , U.S.A . , an attractive display of literature was arranged on the theme “ Maintaining Family Values ​ — How ? ”
In one day , 153 books in six languages were placed .
One woman who approached the literature booth listened attentively to the explanation given by one of the Witnesses .
In the early afternoon , a man passed by the display of literature as he was about to enter the store next to it .
The sister standing in the booth noticed a curious look on his face .
She handed him the book , which he was already reaching for .
The man was grateful for the suggestion , made a donation , and accepted the offer to have someone visit them .
It was wonderful to be a part of this arrangement .
Everyone who participated in it was happy .

No .
Why ?
This time , he corrects an erroneous viewpoint held by some and exhorts the brothers to stand firm in the faith .
Paul writes to Timothy , encouraging him to stay in Ephesus and carry on spiritual warfare against false teachers inside the congregation .
When a wave of persecution is unleashed upon Christians in the wake of a fire that ravages Rome in 64 C.E . , Paul writes his second letter to Timothy .
4 : 12 .
“ STAY AWAKE ”
( 1 Thess .
Paul commends the Thessalonians for ‘ their faithful work , their loving labor , and their endurance . ’
4 : 15 - 17 ​ — Who are “ caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air , ” and how does this happen ?
These are anointed Christians who are alive during Christ’s presence in Kingdom power .
They are “ caught away , ” or raised instantly . ​ — 1 Cor .
Jehovah’s worshippers should continue to make spiritual progress .
2 : 1 - 3 .
Hence , it can be said that Jesus will do away with the man of lawlessness “ by the spirit [ activating force ] of his mouth . ”
Lessons for Us :
The nearness of Jehovah’s day should not be used as an excuse for not working to provide for our needs and to support ourselves in the ministry .
“ GUARD WHAT IS LAID UP IN TRUST WITH YOU ”

Scriptural Questions Answered :
Childbearing , caring for her children , and managing a household can keep a woman “ safe ” from becoming an unoccupied ‘ gossiper and meddler in other people’s affairs . ’ ​ — 1 Tim .
5 : 11 - 15 .
These words apply to the one whose manifestation they describe , namely , Jesus Christ .
Regardless of whether we have embraced Christianity recently or long ago , we should strive to be progressive and continue to make spiritual advancement .
If we are employed by a fellow believer , rather than take advantage of him in any way , we should serve him even more readily than we would someone outside the congregation .
“ PREACH THE WORD , BE AT IT URGENTLY ”
Timothy is advised : “ A slave of the Lord does not need to fight , but needs to be gentle toward all , qualified to teach . ” ​ — 2 Tim .
1 : 7 ; 2 : 24 .
Apostate teachings were spreading , so the apostle counsels the younger overseer : “ Preach the word , be at it urgently . . . , reprove , reprimand , exhort . ” ​ — 2 Tim .
We keep holding to this pattern by practicing what we have learned from the Bible .
4 : 13 ​ — What were “ the parchments ” ?
Some of the scrolls could have been of papyrus but others of parchment .
4 Foretelling the Messiah



Through Isaiah , God foretold the release of the ancient Israelites from Babylonian captivity and their return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple .
How precise was this prophecy ?
What makes God different ?
When he foretells through his prophets that something will occur , he becomes “ the One making the word of his servant come true , and the One that carries out completely the counsel of his own messengers . ”
Rather , they “ spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit . ”
Then we will consider events that Jesus and his disciples foretold for our day and beyond .
Significantly , Bible prophecies include remarkable details of the Messiah’s life .
Isaiah foretold that the Messiah , or Christ , would be born of a virgin .
Details of the Messiah’s Life .
‘ He will not wrangle , nor cry aloud . . .
Isaiah’s prophecy continued to be fulfilled at Jesus ’ death and even afterward .
But later , wealthy Joseph of Arimathea laid Jesus ’ body in his own newly quarried tomb .
Jesus also pointed to the fulfillment of Bible prophecies in the events unfolding around him and in events to come .
Further , Jesus and his disciples themselves foretold events that would occur after their day , including many that we have seen take place today .
The following article will discuss these and other , yet future , fulfillments of Bible prophecy .
page 200 , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ The virgin will . . . give birth to a son ”
Events Foretold for Our Day
THE Bible foretells that God’s Kingdom will bring permanent peace and happiness to the earth .
International Wars .
For example , the newly invented airplane was used to drop bombs on civilians .
In developed countries too , increasing food prices force many to choose between having food for dinner or paying for other necessities , such as medicine or heating .
K . Chadha in 2007 .

“ One - third of the world’s population is currently infected with the TB bacillus , ” reports the World Health Organization .
“ Men will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , self - assuming , haughty , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , without love of goodness , betrayers , headstrong , puffed up with pride , lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God , having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power . ”
“ There will be . . . pestilences ”
Foretelling Our Immediate Future
Worldwide Peace and United Worship .
“ Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples , in this mountain , a banquet of well - oiled dishes , a banquet of wine kept on the dregs , of well - oiled dishes filled with marrow , of wine kept on the dregs , filtered . ” ​ — Isaiah 25 : 6 .
No More Death .
“ He will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes , nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears . And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones , and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth . ” ​ — Isaiah 11 : 3 , 4 .
“ The wilderness and the waterless region will exult , and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron .
They will not build and someone else have occupancy ; they will not plant and someone else do the eating . For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be ; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full .
“ ‘ Just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making are standing before me , ’ is the utterance of Jehovah , ‘ so the offspring of you people and the name of you people will keep standing . ’ ” ​ — Isaiah 65 : 17 - 25 ; 66 : 22 .

Draw Close to God
Compassion .
Have you ever felt that your efforts to cultivate noble attributes are doomed to failure ?
A self - critical heart may insist that certain obstacles , such as ingrained bad habits or painful experiences from the past , make it impossible for you to develop appealing traits .
Note that Paul prefaced the admonition to imitate God with the word “ therefore . ”
As a little boy may try to be just like his father , so true Christians try their best to be like their heavenly Father .
Jehovah does not force humans to imitate him .
On the contrary , he has dignified us with free will .
Never forget , though , that you have within you the potential for displaying godlike qualities .
Colossians 3 : 9 , 10 indicates that being made in God’s image has to do with personality traits .
Those who want to please God are urged to clothe themselves “ with the new personality , ” which is “ made new according to the image of the One [ God ] who created it . ”
But what was the skin bottle he referred to , and how can God put our tears in one ?
The skin bottle was familiar to David .
As a result , the earth is experiencing terrible woes .
For that reason , there are many who , like David , are faced with emotional , mental , or physical suffering ​ — especially those who are trying to please God .
Does that describe you ?
They can be assured that their heavenly Father sees not only the trials they face but also the emotional impact of those trials .
That gift is not at all in conflict with the fact that Adam was perfect .
Perfection in anyone or anything else is limited .
A thing is perfect only in relation to its purpose .
Thus , when Adam sinned , his Creator did not need to correct some design flaw but rightly placed the blame squarely on Adam .
Why , though , did Adam choose to disobey God ?
Did he believe that he would improve his situation in some way ?
▪ Did the Bible foretell the problems we see in the world today ?
See page 22 .
See page 27 .
When you need counsel , they offer it in love .
The psalmist David expressed the depth of Jehovah’s interest in us when he said : “ [ Jehovah’s ] own eyes behold , his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men . ”
How does Jehovah demonstrate a balanced attitude toward our imperfections ?
Likewise , Jehovah did not take offense at the frank words of the widow of Zarephath to the prophet Elijah .
4 , 5 .
How did Jehovah show graciousness in the way he dealt with Abimelech ?
But now return the man’s wife , for he is a prophet , and he will make supplication for you . So keep living . ” ​ — Gen .
But God saw that the man acted honestly on this occasion .
Jesus perfectly imitated his Father , focusing on the good in his disciples and readily forgiving their errors .
Such love explains why Jehovah examines us , how he views us , and how he acts on what he sees . ​ — Read 1 John 4 : 8 , 19 .
Often , these traits begin when a person nurtures unwholesome thoughts or desires .
Why did Jehovah disapprove of Cain’s offering , and how did Cain respond ?
Rather than learn from the event and change his attitude , Cain became consumed with anger toward his brother . ​ — Gen .
If we receive Scriptural counsel , may we appreciate it and view it as an evidence of Jehovah’s love .
How does Jehovah respond to wrongdoing ?
Some may feel that if no one sees them do wrong , they will get away with it .
This fact was reflected in Jehovah’s dealings with Achan and with Ananias and Sapphira .
Following Pentecost of 33 C.E . , a common fund was set up to care for the physical needs of the new believers from distant lands who still remained in Jerusalem .
Satan is doing all he can to corrupt us and make us lose Jehovah’s approval .
Pornography can now be easily accessed through computers or other electronic devices .

( a ) Why does Jehovah eventually bring hidden sins into the open ?
Do you appreciate Jehovah in that way ?
How do we do so ?

Do you see the value of living by Bible principles ?
• Why does Jehovah examine us ?
[ Picture on page 6 ]
“ [ Jehovah’s ] eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ” ​ — 2 CHRON .
3 , 4 .
He said : “ Because [ Jehovah ] is at my right hand , I shall not be made to totter . ” ​ — Ps .
Of course , we cannot literally take Jehovah by the hand and walk with him .
How does Jehovah keep a fatherly eye upon his loyal ones , and how should we feel toward him ?
For instance , he may observe that our potentially treacherous heart begins to desire things that are improper .
Consider God’s response to a situation that developed in the life of Baruch , the prophet Jeremiah’s personal secretary and close friend .
A True Father to Baruch
( b ) How did Jehovah demonstrate his fatherly concern for Baruch ?
Speaking through Jeremiah , Jehovah promptly addressed the matter , saying to Baruch : “ You have said : ‘ Woe , now , to me , for Jehovah has added grief to my pain !
45 : 1 - 5 .
Jehovah also knew that Jerusalem and Judah were in their last days , and he did not want Baruch to stumble at that critical time .
Jehovah evidently reached Baruch’s heart , for he responded positively and survived the destruction of Jerusalem , which occurred 17 years later .
How would you answer the questions raised in the paragraph ?
As you reflect on the account about Baruch , consider the following questions and scriptures : What does God’s way of dealing with Baruch reveal about Jehovah and his feelings toward his servants ?
( Read Luke 21 : 34 - 36 . )
In imitation of Jeremiah , how can Christian elders reflect Jehovah’s concern for His servants ? ​ — Read Galatians 6 : 1 .
Thus , in the book of Revelation , Jesus is depicted as a lamb with “ seven eyes , which eyes mean the seven spirits of God that have been sent forth into the whole earth . ”
He examines us through the eyes of love .
One of Jesus ’ titles , “ Eternal Father , ” reminds us of the role he will play in the granting of everlasting life to all who exercise faith in him .
Therein , Jesus indicated both his awareness of what was happening in each congregation and the depth of his concern for his followers .
Give examples .
Jehovah often answers prayers in these ways .
Regarding help received through prayer , consider the example of three prison inmates who came to a knowledge of Bible truth while incarcerated and became unbaptized publishers .
That sparked a protest .
How glad they were that the “ Hearer of prayer ” was near ! ​ — Ps .
For example , food prices may rise considerably because of increasing demand , extreme weather , or economic instability .
Had he been free , he could have searched for it .
Jeremiah , as well as Baruch , Ebed - melech , and others , survived that time of famine , disease , and death . ​ — Jer .
Yes , “ the eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones , and his ears are toward their supplication . ”
Do you rejoice in your heavenly Father’s watchfulness ?
• How can we show that we are ‘ walking with God ’ ?
• As Head of the Christian congregation , how does Jesus reflect his Father’s qualities ?

“ Imagine , ” she said , “ this was the God I had longed to know since I was a child ! ”
What message does this psalm have for us today ?
By whom was Psalm 83 composed , and what threat does he describe ?
Those enemies were situated all around Israel and are listed as follows : “ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites , Moab and the Hagrites , Gebal and Ammon and Amalek , Philistia together with the inhabitants of Tyre .
Also , Assyria itself has become joined with them . ”
Listen as the psalmist pours out his feelings in prayer : “ O God , let there be no silence on your part ; do not keep speechless , and do not stay quiet , O Divine One . For , look !
Against your people they cunningly carry on their confidential talk . . .
For with the heart they have unitedly exchanged counsel ; against you they proceeded to conclude even a covenant . ” ​ — Ps .
What was the psalmist’s foremost concern ?
What hatred those nations had for God’s chosen people !
But they had another motive for their conspiracy .
“ Your Holy Abiding Place ”
9 , 10 . ( a ) In ancient times , what was God’s holy abiding place ?
In ancient times , the Promised Land was referred to as God’s holy abiding place .
Later , that “ abiding place ” contained a temple with its priesthood and a capital city , Jerusalem , with a line of kings who descended from David and sat on Jehovah’s throne .
To them , Jehovah made the same promise that he made to ancient Israel : “ I shall be their God , and they will be my people . ”
How that infuriates Satan !
Satan’s main goal , however , has always been to break us up as a people so that our God - given name will be remembered no more .
Look back at the words of the psalmist .
A Pattern for Jehovah’s Victory
He weaves together two decisive victories of Israel over its enemies near the ancient city of Megiddo , which dominated a valley plain of the same name .
4 : 13 ; 5 : 19 .
Following God’s direction , they surrounded the enemy camp at night holding jars that concealed flaming torches .
Meanwhile , more Israelites joined in pursuit of the enemy .
Then , “ Jehovah began to throw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the camp into confusion . ”
How have the faces of opposers been ‘ filled with dishonor ’ today ?
Throughout these “ last days , ” Jehovah has thwarted all efforts to eliminate his people .
As a result , opposers have been shamed .

“ In showing honor to one another take the lead . ” ​ — ROM .
God’s Word tells us to honor whom ?
We are also commanded to show honor to family members and fellow believers as well as to some outside the congregation .
What are some ways in which we show that we honor Jehovah ?
What is one important way to honor Jehovah ?
One important way to honor Jehovah is by showing proper respect for his name .
As Paul reminded the Christians in Rome , if we do not live in harmony with the good news we preach , the name of God is “ blasphemed , ” brought into disrepute . ​ — Rom .

By doing so , he imitates Jesus .
He said : “ The harvest is great , but the workers are few .
Time and again , Jesus told his disciples not only what they should do but also why they should do it .
Of what is respect for the worldwide Christian congregation and its representatives a reflection ?
Explain .
When we heed Scriptural counsel from the faithful slave class , we show respect for Jehovah’s arrangement .
In the first - century Christian congregation , the apostle John saw the need to censure those who showed a lack of respect for appointed ones .
The history of the patriarchs , judges , and kings among the ancient Hebrews provides ample evidence that Jehovah gives direction through human representatives .
1 : 2 - 17 ; 2 : 19 , 23 , 24 .
What , then , are some practical ways in which we can honor those who hold positions of oversight in the worldwide Christian congregation ?
Showing Respect for Traveling Overseers
Traveling overseers are certainly to be counted among “ those who are working hard . ”
One way to do so is by responding wholeheartedly to their counsel and encouragement .
What , though , if we are directed to do things in a way that is different from what we are used to ?
What are some ways in which we show respect for fellow believers ?
To the contrary , entreat him as a father , younger men as brothers , older women as mothers , younger women as sisters with all chasteness .
What , though , if there is a personal difference between you and your brother or sister ?
Indeed , in the Christian congregation , which is identified by the heartfelt love that exists among its members , we have numerous opportunities to honor one another . ​ — Read John 13 : 34 , 35 .
Granted , applying that principle can be a challenge if a workmate or a schoolmate treats us unkindly .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Picture on page 24 ]
Elders in every land honor traveling overseers , who are appointed by the Governing Body
Why did Jesus reject Peter’s rebuke ?
THE apostle Peter could not believe his ears .
Likely they too shared this mistaken opinion .
Then he said to Peter : “ Get behind me , Satan !
might have reminded his listeners of Satan’s allegation in the days of Job : “ Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul . ”
The answer is , Of no benefit at all .
What was Jesus ’ priority ?
Rather than please himself , he said : “ I always do the things pleasing to [ God ] . ”
Earlier , when Jesus began to warn his followers that he would soon have to “ give his soul , ” Peter urged him to be kind to himself .
If a slave came to love his owner , he could choose to remain a slave in the household for the rest of his life .
We make a similar choice when we dedicate ourselves to God .
What a privilege it is to be a loyal servant for Jehovah to use as he pleases !
Those words may have reminded Jewish Christians of the sacrifices that were a feature of their worship before they became followers of Jesus .
Anything inferior was unacceptable .
When we dedicate ourselves to God , we unreservedly give him our “ souls , ” our lives ​ — including our strength , assets , and abilities .
12 , 13 .
True , “ for everything there is an appointed time , ” including pleasurable relaxation and secular employment to enable us to fulfill our Christian obligations .
However , a dedicated Christian needs to stay balanced and use his time wisely .
Could you adjust your circumstances in order to spend more time , even “ considerable time , ” in the preaching work , perhaps serving as a pioneer ? ​ — Read Hebrews 13 : 15 .
When the apostle Paul and Barnabas visited the Christian congregation in Antioch , “ they spent not a little time with the disciples ” in order to encourage them .
Many have found joy in helping to provide relief to those who have suffered loss through man - made or natural disasters .
6 : 10 .
What would you personally give in exchange for everlasting life ?
We will surely make whatever sacrifices Jehovah asks of us in order to gain “ the real life . ”
Nevertheless , like Jesus , we avoid the temptation to ‘ be kind to ourselves . ’
• In ancient Israel , only what kind of sacrifices were acceptable to Jehovah , and how does that guide us today ?
“ This Is Indeed God’s Most Holy and Great Name ”
In that sermon , In principio erat verbum ( In the Beginning Was the Word ) , Nicholas of Cusa used the Latin spelling Iehoua for Jehovah .
This codex from the early 15th century is one of the oldest extant documents in which the Tetragrammaton is rendered “ Iehoua . ”
In fact , my father used to say , “ Whenever the wind blows on you , you get sick . ”
WHEN I was a child , clergymen prayed fervently for peace , but when the second world war broke out , they prayed for victory .
This puzzled me and raised doubts in my mind .
Annie left the book Salvation with us and invited Mother to attend a Bible discussion that would be held in Annie’s home .
It was about the ransom , and to my surprise , the discussion was not boring at all .
About the time I was baptized , street - corner witnessing was introduced .
And that is exactly what I did !
In May 1945 , I had the joy of starting to serve as a special pioneer .
While pioneering in Lisburn , Ireland , I studied with a man who was an assistant pastor in a Protestant church .
That was a hard time for me .
I met an elderly man who had accepted one of our publications more than 20 years earlier .
Together with his son and daughter , he accepted the truth .
Oh , how I enjoyed the Bible instruction we received during those months !
The instructor , Brother Maxwell Friend , humorously said : “ Not only were you nervous in the beginning , as all good speakers are , but you were nervous right to the end . ”
During the course , we all improved in our ability to express ourselves in front of the class .
In 1952 , there were fewer than 150 Kingdom publishers in Thailand .
It was especially challenging to say the words in the right tone .
But gradually ​ — and after many laughs — ​ we succeeded .
Most Thai are Buddhist and are not familiar with the Bible .
In Khorat , I studied with the postmaster .
Like the apostle Paul , we experienced what it means to “ have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power . ” ​ — Phil .
The first two and a half years , we traveled by bicycle , up and down the hills , rain or shine .
How truthful are the words at Ecclesiastes 4 : 9 , 10 : “ Two are better than one , . . . for if one of them should fall , the other one can raise his partner up ” !
That straightforward comment made Benjamin think about his life .
I really am a fragile ‘ earthen vessel . ’
How grateful I am , though , that I took up the pioneer service when I was young !
It is now out of print .
The answer lies in understanding what Paul meant by “ all things . ”
They are ‘ saved through a bath ’ in that God has bathed , or cleansed , them with the blood of Jesus on the merit of the ransom sacrifice .
They are ‘ made new by holy spirit ’ because they have become “ a new creation ” as spirit - begotten sons of God . ​ — 2 Cor .
As in the first century , mature Christian sisters today need to “ be reverent in behavior , not slanderous , neither enslaved to a lot of wine , teachers of what is good . ”
Keeping our “ minds on maintaining fine works ” is “ fine and beneficial ” because it helps us to be fruitful in God’s service and keeps us separate from the wicked world .
EXHORT “ ON THE BASIS OF LOVE ”
Philemon is commended for being an example in “ love and faith . ”
His being a source of refreshment to fellow Christians has given Paul “ much joy and comfort . ” ​ — Philem .

Scriptural Questions Answered :
However , from the start of Satan’s course of wickedness in Eden , his lies have caused death because Adam sinned and passed sin and death on to the human family .
Even if God permits some of us to die under Satan’s attacks , we can be confident that God will undo whatever harm is brought upon us .
4 : 9 - 11 ​ — How do we “ enter into [ God’s ] rest ” ?
Jehovah is the Maker of the new covenant , while Jesus is “ the human covenanter . ”
Jesus is the Mediator of that covenant , and by his death , he provided the sacrifice needed to validate it . ​ — Luke 22 : 20 ; Heb .
This was not a literal city but a symbolic one .
Abraham was awaiting “ heavenly Jerusalem , ” composed of Christ Jesus and his 144,000 corulers .
It was the joy of seeing what his ministry would accomplish ​ — including the sanctification of Jehovah’s name , the vindication of God’s sovereignty , and the ransoming of the human family from death .

A Lover of Justice
His Word , the Bible , assures us that hard - hearted practicers of sin will not escape divine retribution .
( Verse 26 ) Willful sinners are most reprehensible .
They make a practice of sin .
At the latest , they will stand before God in the near future when he comes to rid this earth of all injustice .
Learning that Jehovah God does not condone willful sin is both comforting and reassuring , especially for those who have been hurt by a hardened wrongdoer .

Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Break Up Marriages ?
“ IF ONE partner changes his or her religion , the marriage will break up . ”
But is this assertion always true ?
A Husband’s Perspective
I suddenly felt that my lifestyle was threatened .
It has continued to improve since my wife was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses 15 years ago . ”
What helped the marriage to succeed ?
I liked to make many decisions on my own .
So I try to be a good wife , to speak and act in a way that makes Jehovah and my husband happy . ”
At first , my husband didn’t want me to engage in the public preaching work .
Today , he gives me full support in my spiritual activities .
A Force for Good
One husband who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses honestly admitted : “ I initially felt some anguish when my wife embraced the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses , but I now feel the gain was worth the pain . ”
Another had this to say about his wife : “ My wife’s faithfulness , determination , and integrity have caused me to have great admiration for Jehovah’s Witnesses .
▪ Do Jehovah’s Witnesses encourage their members to separate from a marriage mate who is not a Witness ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses abide by this command .
However , a husband’s authority is not absolute .
He is accountable to God and Christ .
No .
Therefore , Jehovah’s Witnesses hold to Jesus ’ view that adultery provides grounds for divorce .
She says : “ I noticed for some time that Michael , my husband , had been emotionally distant from me and was treating our children coldly .
* His behavior changed soon after we were connected to the Internet , and I suspected that he was viewing pornography on the computer .
One night after the children had gone to bed , I cornered him , and he confessed that he had been viewing pornographic Web sites .
To make matters worse , a workmate had recently started to express a romantic interest in me . ”
I felt horribly embarrassed and very guilty .
Like many couples , though , their commitment to the marriage waned over time , and they seemed to drift apart .
Do you feel that the bond between you and your mate has weakened as the years have passed ?
What challenges can undermine such commitment ?
Certainly , such motives are admirable and will help a marriage survive difficult times .
To create that sort of bond , a couple must learn to trust each other .
Equally important , they need to develop a lifelong friendship .
Mortar is made from a combination of ingredients , including sand , cement , and water .
However , the concept of yielding to someone else’s wishes ​ — of giving without asking , ‘ What’s in it for me ? ’ ​ — has become unpopular with many and even offensive to some .
Likely the answer is , Few if any .
Why ?
It states that “ the married man is anxious for the things of the world , how he may gain the approval of his wife , ” and that “ the married woman is anxious for the things of the world , how she may gain the approval of her husband . ”

And a woman who respects her husband has “ great value in the eyes of God . ” ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 1 - 4 , 7 .
How important is your marriage to you ?
Now number the list according to what you believe to be your spouse’s priorities .
When a person engages in sexual intercourse outside of marriage , he or she delivers a devastating blow to the union , one that the Bible says is grounds for divorce .
Do you think that he is making it easier for his wife to remain committed to the marriage ?
Is he treating her as his closest friend ?
Who can know it ? ” Has your heart fooled you ?
If my spouse asked me to limit my contact with an associate of the opposite sex , how would I react ?
TRY THIS : If you find yourself attracted to someone other than your mate , limit your contact with that one to only what is necessary and keep all encounters on a purely professional level .
Instead , focus on your mate’s positive qualities .
Recall the reasons why you fell in love with your mate .
Of course , seeking advice is just the first step .
Are you willing to do that ?
While the example here is of a man who viewed pornography , a woman who did the same would also be displaying a lack of commitment to the marriage .
What could I do to assure my mate that I am committed to our marriage ?

The Scriptures foretold his coming and showed that he was a unique Shepherd who sought to find the “ lost sheep ” of Israel .
Discouragement , health problems , or other factors may have weakened their zeal and caused them to become inactive .
Those in the flock of God lack nothing in a spiritual way , but that is not the happy lot of sheep who have strayed .
How can aid be provided ?
How did Jesus show what is needed to rescue lost sheep of God’s pasturage ?
Earnest effort is required to rescue lost sheep of God’s pasturage .
Who can help sheeplike individuals who have strayed from the flock ?
5 : 1 - 3 .
Christian shepherds need to imitate “ the fine shepherd , ” Jesus .
Inactive ones are particularly vulnerable and therefore need assistance in order to apply the admonition to ‘ walk by spirit . ’
( Compare Proverbs 27 : 23 . )
This includes making arrangements to help sheep who have strayed .
So God is pleased when elders take similar steps in an effort to help sheep who have strayed to return to the flock .
Elders may read scriptures , review an article , discuss meeting highlights , pray with the inactive one , and so forth .
A Cooperative Effort
Others can cooperate with these shepherds .
How may such assistance be given ?
How might you be privileged to assist one who needs some spiritual assistance ?
Paul longed to see Christians in Rome in order to impart some spiritual gift to them so that they might be made firm .
Should we not have that spirit when we seek to help sheep who have strayed from the flock of God ?
How wonderful , reasonable , satisfying , and spiritually liberating the truth was !
Continue to Show Them Love
Do the foregoing suggestions really work ?
Yes .
It is love that motivates Christians to assist inactive ones to return to the congregation .
Yes , love is an identifying mark of true Christians .
Should not that love be expressed for baptized Christians who may have become inactive ?
Depending on the circumstances , you may also need to be forgiving .
But , besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union . ” ​ — Col .
3 : 12 - 14 .
Why is it worthwhile to make the effort to help sheeplike ones return to the Christian fold ?
It will also show how those returning can expect to be received .
• How may you be able to help those who are not now associating with the congregation ?
“ Whom shall we go away to ?
What did Peter say when many disciples abandoned Jesus ?
JESUS CHRIST was once abandoned by many disciples who rejected one of his teachings .
There was nowhere else to go .
5 : 1 ; Gal .
In the preceding article , reference was made to Jesus ’ illustration about a man who had 100 sheep .
Motivated by love , elders and other members of the congregation have probably visited the inactive one .
Perhaps they can encourage a person to return to the congregation by kindly showing him that Jehovah loves His sheep and requires only things that we can do .
To discern how to help inactive fellow believers , elders and other mature publishers need to listen carefully as such individuals make heartfelt expressions .
What can we encourage those who have strayed from the flock to do ?
12 : 5 - 13 .
Was It a Problem With a Teaching ?
10 , 11 .
When endeavoring to help those who have strayed from God’s flock , the elder might refer to the disciples who abandoned Jesus because of rejecting one of his teachings .
By cutting off association with Christ and his faithful followers , they lost their spirituality and their joy .
No , for there is none !
If someone who has strayed from the flock admits that he has committed serious sin , how may it be possible to help him ?
But they will not be expelled from the congregation if they have discontinued the unscriptural practice and are genuinely repentant .
Since this system of things will soon be destroyed , he should ‘ come home ’ without delay .
With some , drifting takes place gradually , just as a boat that is adrift slowly floats farther from land .
16 - 18 . ( a ) How did one elder help a brother who had been inactive for years ?
One Christian elder says : “ Our local body of elders is very interested in calling on those who are inactive .
He admits : “ I started giving more attention to worldly matters than to spiritual things .
This brother’s problems began to subside after he accepted a personal Bible study .
He says , “ I realized that what was missing in my life was the love and guidance of Jehovah and his organization . ”
That really touched my heart .
How can you encourage inactive ones to return to the flock without delay , and how can you show them that God does not expect too much of us ?
Urge them to start attending immediately .
She also did what she could .
Most of us can attend Christian meetings and share in the Kingdom - preaching work .

Ladies who go to a window in search of light and find only darkness are a fitting illustration of dimming eyesight .
Moreover , death inherited from Adam is one of “ the works of the Devil ” that God’s Son will undo by means of his Messianic Kingdom .
At the present time , some of Jehovah’s servants find themselves faced with the problems of ill health and aging that are common to sinful mankind .
Paul himself had to deal with “ a thorn in the flesh , ” perhaps an eye affliction or some other physical ailment for which there was no medical cure at that time .
Instead , God strengthened him to endure it .
Why should we avoid excessive concern over our health ?
Of course , we are aware that perfect health is not yet attainable .
magazines occasionally include articles regarding our spiritual brothers and sisters who have serious illnesses .
*
New moon and sabbath , the calling of a convention ​ — I cannot put up with the use of uncanny power along with the solemn assembly . ”
Satan will resort to any means to distract us from true worship .
Why do we need wisdom in choosing health care , and what wise counsel did the first - century governing body give ?
Keeping a Scriptural view of health care requires divine wisdom and calls for good judgment on our part .
Then , too , we will experience the fulfillment of this thrilling prophecy : “ No resident will say : ‘ I am sick . ’ ” ​ — Isa .
While taking reasonable care of our health , of what can we be assured ?
By Way of Review
• Who is responsible for sickness , and who will relieve us of the effects of sin ?
• Although it is normal for us to be concerned about our health , what should we avoid ?
• Why does our choice of therapy matter to Jehovah ?
• With regard to our health , how can we benefit from adhering to Bible principles ?
Why was Jehovah confident that Jesus would successfully resist the Devil ?
Writing under divine inspiration , the prophet Daniel foretold : “ In the days of those kings [ existing in our day ] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [ in heaven ] that will never be brought to ruin . And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people . It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [ now existing ] , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ”
There is no doubt that Jehovah’s organization will be preserved and will prosper spiritually .
But this requires diligent effort and earnest prayer for ‘ deliverance from the wicked one . ’ ​ — Matt .
In the wilderness , Satan used temptations in an effort to get Jesus to compromise His obedience to Jehovah .
Neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor men kept for unnatural purposes , nor men who lie with men . . . will inherit God’s kingdom . ”
Supposedly , this would result in a spectacular display of Jesus ’ Messiahship .
4 : 7 ; Deut .
Let us not put Jehovah to the test in improper ways , perhaps by cultivating friendship with the world . ​ — Read James 4 : 4 ; 1 John 2 : 15 - 17 .
However , Satan did not intend to stop tempting Jesus , for we are told : “ So the Devil , having concluded all the temptation [ in the wilderness ] , retired from him until another convenient time . ”
But we should also seek God’s continued help , for the Devil will return to tempt us at another time convenient for him ​ — and not necessarily when we may be expecting a temptation .
Jesus assured his followers of the availability of God’s spirit by saying : “ If you , although being [ imperfect and thus comparatively ] wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him ! ”
Let us continue praying to Jehovah for his holy spirit .
In addition to regular and fervent prayer , we need to put on the complete suit of spiritual armor from God in order ‘ to stand firm against the machinations , or crafty acts , of the Devil . ’ ​ — Eph . 6 : 11 - 18 , ftn .

What Kind of Person Do You Want to Be ?
Pointing to the stack of papers on his desk , he added : “ Did you know that all of these are records of past judicial cases against him ?
It was the inspired message of God’s Word , the Bible .
However , our new personality is still in its early stage .
We must continue to enhance it by making adjustments .
Even Paul saw the need to make improvements .
When we renovate an old house , it is not enough to paint the outside if there are rotten beams inside .
Self - scrutiny , then , is a must .
To that end , Jehovah has provided us with help .
It pierces deep down within us ​ — figuratively to the marrow in the innermost part of the bones .
What help God’s Word is in enabling us to recognize our problems !
When we repair an old house , it may not be enough to replace the damaged materials .
Even the television programs and movies we watch , as well as other forms of entertainment , leave their mark .
Referring to those in the congregation in Corinth who had been fornicators , homosexuals , drunkards , and the like , Paul said : “ That is what some of you were . But you have been washed clean . . . with the spirit of our God . ”
With the help of Jehovah’s holy spirit , we too can succeed in making necessary changes .
Consider the case of a man named Marcos , * who lives in the Philippines .
Commenting on his background , Marcos said : “ My parents were always arguing .
Marcos became notorious for gambling , thievery , and holdups .
He is now a baptized Christian who regularly shares in teaching others how they too can change .
3 : 8 - 10 .
Our primary goal , then , is to put away the old personality and put on the new .
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you , so do you also . But , besides all these things , clothe yourselves with love , for it is a perfect bond of union . ”
Another way to discern what changes we may need to make is by studying the personality traits of Bible characters , considering what was attractive about them and what was not .

He counseled fellow Christians : “ Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another . ”
Leaving personal differences unresolved can likewise be disastrous .
Jesus instructed his disciples : “ If , then , you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you , leave your gift there in front of the altar , and go away ; first make your peace with your brother , and then , when you have come back , offer up your gift . ”
*
“ Happy are the peacemakers , ” said Jesus .
Furthermore , peace promotes good health , for “ a calm heart is the life of the fleshly organism . ”
Although most Christians agree that pursuing peace is necessary , you may wonder how to resolve a personal difference .
Let us examine Scriptural principles that can guide us .
Before “ the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh ” moved across the Jordan River , they erected “ an altar great in conspicuousness . ”
The other tribes of Israel believed that the altar was used for idolatrous worship and could not just ignore the problem .
Would they lash out at their accusers or refuse to speak to them ?
Their response preserved their relationship with God and saved lives .
On the other hand , what if a fellow Christian confronts us about a problem , perhaps even falsely accusing us ?
“ An answer , when mild , turns away rage , ” says the Bible .
Harbored resentment can easily lead to critical speech .
Pursuing peace , however , does not mean avoiding all talk about our brothers and sisters .
But such a course is unwise .

Baptism is a requirement for those seeking salvation .
The baptismal candidate must have faith that salvation is possible only because Jesus died a sacrificial death , was resurrected , and “ is at God’s right hand , ” having authority over the living and the dead .
For our faith to have excelling value , it must be of proved , or tested , quality .

The “ daystar ” is Jesus Christ in Kingdom power .
Peter was referring to advance knowledge , or foreknowledge , of future events , given to him and other Bible writers by inspiration .
In addition to helping us increase in “ accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus , ” our putting forth earnest effort to cultivate such qualities as faith , endurance , and godly devotion can “ cause [ us ] to be neither inactive nor unfruitful ” regarding that knowledge . ​ — 2 Pet . 1 : 8 , ftn .

“ The Song of the Sea ” ​ — A Manuscript That Bridges a Gap

Commenting on the relevance of the scroll fragment , Adolfo Roitman , head of the Shrine of the Book , Israel Museum , and curator of the Dead Sea Scrolls , states : “ The Song of the Sea manuscript demonstrates the tremendous fidelity with which the Masoretic version of the Bible was transmitted over the centuries .
Moreover , the Scriptures were meticulously copied by scribes .
Obviously , standards of cleanliness vary according to customs and circumstances .

Jehovah is said to be worthy to “ receive ” glory , honor , and power .
Without question , he is the most glorious , honorable , and powerful Personage in the universe .

Will she share in that , or will she try to change the subject ?
Do you have your own integrity in mind as you face your concerns , needs , and goals in life ?
On a day - to - day basis , people think about their appearance , their health , the challenges of making a living , the ups and downs of their friendships , perhaps even romance .
We may give such concerns considerable attention .
It is our integrity .
Jehovah bestows what privilege on us , and what will we consider in this article ?
The Hebrew words relating to “ integrity ” come from a root meaning sound , whole , or faultless .
An animal for sacrifice gained his approval only if it was sound , or whole .
Explain .
Imagine , for instance , a book collector who finds a precious volume after a long search , only to discover that it is missing several vital pages .
Disappointed , he may put it back on the shelf .
Rest assured that Jehovah does not expect us to be perfect in the absolute sense .
He expects us , not to be perfect , but to love him wholeheartedly , giving worship to him alone .
7 , 8 . ( a ) Jesus set what example regarding integrity ?
( Read Mark 12 : 28 - 30 . )
He showed that integrity is expressed , not in mere words , but in positive actions that spring from pure motives .
Our priorities in life will reflect his priorities .
Let us consider three reasons why this is so important .
His rulership thus needs to be vindicated ​ — confirmed as right , just , and loving — ​ before all intelligent creatures .
What charge has Satan made regarding the integrity of humans , and how would you like to respond ?
He taunts Jehovah with the claim that Christians ​ — including you — ​ will not remain faithful .
What would be the course of integrity ?
The husband who is using the Internet could look at sexually arousing material , but he recalls the principle reflected in Job’s words : “ A covenant I have concluded with my eyes . So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin ? ”
Similarly , the man refuses to let his eyes rest on unsavory images , avoiding such material as if it were poison .
Do you view your personal choices and decisions in that light ?
It is thus the basis on which God can judge us .
( Read Job 31 : 6 . )
Job knew that God weighs all mankind in “ accurate scales , ” using His perfect standard of justice to gauge our integrity .
David similarly said : “ Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples . Judge me , O Jehovah , according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me . . . .
We need to remember , though , what he is looking for .
Only three perfect humans have walked this earth , and two , Adam and Eve , failed to keep integrity .
Still , many millions of imperfect humans have succeeded in doing so .
Because integrity is at the core of Jehovah’s judgment of us , it is essential to our hope for the future .
( b ) What questions will the next article discuss ?
It can give us the joy we need to get through difficult times .
[ Footnote ]
Jesus did say : “ You must accordingly be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect . ”
He evidently understood that even imperfect humans can be complete , or perfect , in a relative sense .
1 , 2 .
In today’s world , literal building projects often prove costly .
Likewise , building integrity costs time and effort , yet it is well worth it .
So let us discuss three questions : How can we be people of integrity ?
How can we maintain our Christian integrity ?
Jesus lived a course of perfect obedience .
He “ became obedient as far as death . ”
Pornography is harmful , for it inflames wrong and greedy desires , damages the conscience , erodes marriages , and degrades everyone involved . ​ — Prov .
7 : 1 ; 1 Thess .
How pleased Jehovah must be when he sees you resisting temptation !
Do not trade your precious integrity for the shameful act of looking at or reading pornography !
We can also be integrity keepers by obeying Jehovah when we are among unbelievers .
Think of Daniel and his three companions .
As youths , they were taken as captives to Babylon .
There , surrounded by unbelievers who knew little or nothing of Jehovah , the four Hebrews were put under pressure to eat delicacies that God’s Law forbade .
Around the world , young Witnesses of Jehovah are following a similar course , holding to God’s standards for Christians and refusing to give in to harmful peer pressure .
You benefit yourself , and you delight Jehovah and your fellow Christians ! ​ — Ps .
We also need to be obedient when dealing with members of the opposite sex .
We do not try to get as close as we can to sin without being punished .
Did he decide that it was no use enduring ?
On the contrary .
We are part of a worldwide congregation of imperfect humans , any one of whom may wrong us or even become unfaithful .
Still , how will we respond should an individual let us down or hurt our feelings ?
He is blessing his people now more than ever .
We are delighted to see evidence that the spiritual light is still increasing .
What if Someone Does Not Keep Integrity ?
Without it , we have no relationship with Jehovah and no real hope .
Still , some fail to maintain their integrity .
What can be done ? Let us first consider what not to do .
( Read Hebrews 4 : 13 . )
Jehovah is not pleased with acts of worship carried out by individuals who are concealing serious sins .
21 : 27 ; Isa .
18 , 19 . ( a ) How does David’s example show that integrity can be regained ?
David’s life exemplified what we read at Proverbs 24 : 16 : “ The righteous one may fall even seven times , and he will certainly get up . ”
( Read 1 Kings 9 : 4 . )
Yes , you will be a person of integrity by showing loving obedience .
The wallet contained $ 2,000 , far more money than she was used to carrying .
“ I was crushed , ” she later told a local newspaper .
“ It was a really , really beautiful thing to do , ” the grateful owner commented .
The newspaper noted that as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , she “ credits her integrity to the religion with which she was raised . ”
Yet , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , is unique in many ways .
Jesus said : “ I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me . ”
( b ) How was Jesus ’ role in creation unique ?
The Greek word translated “ only - begotten ” has been defined as “ single of its kind , only , ” “ the only member of a kin or kind , ” or “ unique . ”
The only - begotten Son’s role in creation is also unique .
He was not the Creator , or Originator , of creation .
Why is Jesus called “ the Word , ” or Logos ?
If anyone desires to do His will , he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality . ”
Appreciation for Jesus ’ example of humility should move us to avoid speaking of our own initiative .
8 , 9 . ( a ) What does the word “ amen ” mean , and why is Jesus called “ the Amen ” ?
( b ) How did Jesus fulfill his role as “ the Amen ” ?
The word rendered “ amen ” is a transliteration of a Hebrew word that means “ so be it , ” or “ surely . ”
Of all God’s creatures , the firstborn Son could give the most conclusive answer to that charge .
How can we imitate Jesus in his unique role as “ the Amen ” ?
11 , 12 .
What does Jesus ’ role as Mediator involve ?
Why should all Christians , whatever their hope , truly appreciate Jesus ’ role as Mediator ?
Whether we have a heavenly hope or an earthly hope , each one of us has good reason to appreciate Jesus ’ role as the Mediator of the new covenant .
Why is Jesus ’ sacrifice truly unique ?
Jesus was a perfect man , the exact equal of Adam before that one sinned .
Truly , appreciation of this fact should move us to ‘ live no longer for ourselves , but for him who died for us . ’ ​ — 2 Cor .
The Foretold “ Seed ”
What prophecy was uttered after Adam sinned , and what was later revealed concerning this prophecy ?
Also , he was to be in the line of King David . ​ — Gen .
How is it that Christ is the promised Seed , and yet others too are included ?
Yes , Jesus ’ role in fulfilling this prophecy is truly unique .
What have we learned from this brief review of Jesus ’ unique role in Jehovah’s purpose ?
Do You Remember ?
• What have you learned about the unique role of Jesus from his titles or designations ?
( See box . )
▪ The Word .
Only one man , Jesus Christ , is the primary part of that foretold seed .
It would be fascinating to study in detail all that Paul did thereafter , but for now , let us focus on a talk Paul gave in about 56 C.E . , as set out in Acts chapter 20 .
You can imagine how excited the Ephesian elders were when they received Paul’s message .
Paul had followed what course when he was in Ephesus for some years ?
( Compare Acts 17 : 16 , 17 . )
He described his pattern of life over the years , including when he earlier was in Ephesus .
With no fear of contradiction , he said : “ You well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia . . . I thoroughly bore witness . ”
Here is scriptural warrant for house to house evangelism as well as that carried on in public meetings . ”
Do you think it likely that all those who did hear stayed in Ephesus , none moving elsewhere to do business , to be near relatives , or to escape the hustle and bustle of big - city life ?
Hardly .
What would happen when they returned home ?
Those who had accepted the truth would bear witness .
Others might not have become believers , yet they likely talked of what they had heard while in Ephesus .
Hence , relatives , neighbors , or clients heard the truth , and some may have accepted it .
( Compare Mark 5 : 14 . ) What does this suggest about the effect that your bearing thorough witness might have ?
Paul never visited them , but the good news reached them .
Epaphras was from that area .
( b ) What will be the yeartext for 2009 ?
That command applies to all true Christians today , as Jesus ’ words indicate : “ Look ! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ​ — Matt .
In a 2007 book on effective missionary work , David G .
( a ) Why do we call “ multiple times ” at homes in our territory ?
Others may have listened briefly as you shared a Bible verse or a Scriptural thought .
Perhaps something happened to them , or to a loved one , that opened their mind and heart to the truth .
Hence , do not give up , even if you have not recently found many receptive ones .
With some , there may be immediate good results .
Yes , it may be that they inadvertently enable those seeds to find receptive soil elsewhere .
Witnessing by one brother led to what results ?
In time , Jodi met Mandi , as both of them were nurses .
Mandi was pleased to answer Jodi’s questions .
It might be , though , that you witness at a door , at work , in school , or in an informal setting , and unknown to you , it becomes the avenue for spreading truth to others .
During 2009 , may we all take to heart our commission to witness from house to house and in other ways .
• What is the yeartext for 2009 , and why do you feel that it is fitting ?
[ Blurb on page 19 ]
The yeartext for 2009 will be : “ Bear thorough witness to the good news . ” ​ — Acts 20 : 24 .
Archaeologists have unearthed cuneiform texts that discuss people and events mentioned in the Scriptures .
And what testimony to the Bible’s reliability do such texts offer ?
“ Signs could now represent not only words but also syllables , several of which could be combined to represent the syllables of a word , ” explains the NIV Archaeological Study Bible .
Archaeology Odyssey states : “ Experts estimate that somewhere between one and two million cuneiform tablets have already been excavated , and another 25,000 or so are found every year . ”
The discovery of bilingual and trilingual texts in cuneiform writing was the key to deciphering cuneiform .
Says the book The Bible in the British Museum : “ In his address in 1870 to the newly formed Society of Biblical Archaeology Dr Samuel Birch was able to identify [ in cuneiform texts the names of ] the Hebrew kings Omri , Ahab , Jehu , Azariah . . . , Menahem , Pekah , Hoshea , Hezekiah and Manasseh , the Assyrian kings Tiglath - Pileser . . . [ III ] , Sargon , Sennacherib , Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal , . . . and the Syrians Benhadad , Hazael and Rezin . ”
Among those to benefit were the Jews .
In 1883 an archive of over 700 cuneiform texts was found in Nippur , near Babylon .
Among the 2,500 names mentioned , about 70 can be identified as Jewish .
They appear , says historian Edwin Yamauchi , “ as contracting parties , agents , witnesses , collectors of taxes , and royal officials . ”
The evidence that Jews continued to conduct such activities close to Babylon in this period is significant .
10 : 21 , 22 .
Those that experts have already deciphered furnish eloquent testimony to the dependability of the Bible .
I Have Seen It Grow in Korea
Later , in 1948 , we were married .
Liz agreed to go with me to a meeting for prospective Gilead students .
As directed in the letter quoted above , we went first to Japan .
Over 200 Korean Witnesses welcomed us , and we shed tears of joy .
Koreans have not only their own language and alphabet but also their own cuisine , physical features , and traditional dress , as well as other things unique to them , such as the design of their buildings .
There were no books available to us on how to learn Korean .
A person can learn correct pronunciation only by learning the Korean alphabet .
We made mistakes .
The householder had a strange look on her face as she left and brought back a box of matches .
Liz had asked for sungnyang ( matches ) instead of sungkyung , the word for “ Bible . ”
Back in 1944 , during World War II , I too refused to enter military service and thus had to spend two and a half years in the U.S . penitentiary in Lewisburg , Pennsylvania .
If we had left Korea during those years , we would not have been allowed to return .
Eventually , they realized that we would not be intimidated , so that restriction ended at last ​ — after ten years .
During the mid - 1980 ’ s , opposers of our ministry falsely accused the directors of our legal corporation of teaching young men to refrain from entering the military .
This helped set the record straight for the future .
God Blesses Our Work
In Korea , opposition to our preaching work had intensified through the years because of our neutrality .
After returning to the United States , many have become active Witnesses .
There are more than 95,000 Witnesses in Korea , nearly 40 percent of them serving as either regular or auxiliary pioneers .
Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Paying attention to the message of the three letters of John and of Jude’s epistle can help us to remain strong in the faith despite obstacles . ​ — Heb .
( 1 John 1 : 1 – 5 : 21 )
Intended for the entire association of those in union with the Christ , John’s first letter provides sound counsel designed to help Christians take their stand against apostasy and remain firm for the truth and for righteousness .
John is speaking about the commandment regarding self - sacrificing brotherly love .
19 : 18 ; John 15 : 12 , 13 .
5 : 5 - 8 ​ — How did water , blood , and spirit bear witness to the fact that “ Jesus is the Son of God ” ?
2 : 9 - 11 ; 3 : 15 .
If a Christian allows anything or anyone to destroy his brotherly love , he is walking in spiritual darkness , not knowing where he is going .
Or he may be using a figure of speech to address a particular congregation in order to confuse persecutors .
7 ​ — What “ coming ” of Jesus does John speak of here , and how are deceivers “ not confessing ” it ?
Lessons for Us :
8 - 11 .
( 3 John 1 - 14 )
The third letter of John is addressed to his personal friend Gaius .
“ We . . . are under obligation to receive such persons hospitably , ” says the apostle , “ that we may become fellow workers in the truth . ” ​ — 3 John 5 - 8 .
Lacking spirituality , some do not see God with their eyes of understanding .
John uses it to refer to fellow believers in general .
( Jude 1 - 25 )
5 - 7 .
Can the wicked escape Jehovah’s judgment ?
We should follow the example of Michael the archangel and show respect for divinely constituted authority .
False teachers may seem to be generous , but they are like waterless clouds in that they are spiritually empty .
22 , 23 .
In an effort to save “ some that have doubts ” out of the fire of everlasting destruction , mature ones in the congregation ​ — especially appointed overseers — ​ provide them with spiritual help . [ Pictures on page 28 ]
Water , spirit , and blood bore witness that “ Jesus is the Son of God ”
Thus , Insight on the Scriptures explains that “ the fatty things ” here “ refers to rich portions , things not skinny or dry , but luscious , including tasty items prepared with vegetable oils . ”

And more important , how does God view her ?
Mary might well have wondered who would believe her story .
Mary’s strong faith enabled her to submit to the will of her God , Jehovah .
Jehovah’s slave girl ! May it take place with me according to your declaration . ”
Mary was willing to face the challenges that lay ahead because she valued the spiritual privilege she had been offered . ​ — Luke 1 : 38 .
The Bible does not say how long this difficult period lasted .
However , both Mary and Joseph must have felt extremely relieved when Jehovah’s angel appeared to Joseph .
Caesar Augustus decreed a census , requiring all to register in their town of origin .
Later some shepherds arrived , eager to see the baby .
Then we read : “ Mary began to preserve all these sayings , drawing conclusions in her heart . ”
Doing so will surely help us to endure trials .
Poor and a Refugee
The Bible indicates that Joseph and Mary were relatively poor .
Among the few facts that the Gospels ​ — Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John — ​ reveal about this couple is that 40 days after Mary gave birth , she and Joseph went to the temple to make the required offering ​ — “ a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons . ”
Nonetheless , living in a foreign country can be challenging and disorienting .
Are you and your family among the many millions who have left their homeland , perhaps for the welfare of their children or to escape danger ?
However , consider what the Gospels say .
Matthew 1 : 25 states that Joseph “ had no intercourse with her until she gave birth to a son . ”
Mary was a spiritually - minded person .
Although the Law did not require women to attend the Passover celebration , Mary customarily accompanied Joseph on the annual journey to Jerusalem for the festival .
That would have involved a round - trip of nearly 190 miles [ 300 km ] each year ​ — with a growing family !
They know , as Mary doubtless did , that worshipping God together with their husband and children strengthens and unifies the family .
Once when Mary and Joseph were returning from a festival in Jerusalem ​ — probably with several children now — ​ they realized that 12 - year - old Jesus was not with them .
Here is another indication of Mary’s depth of spirituality .
Years later , she likely recounted vivid memories concerning this and other events of Jesus ’ early life to the Gospel writers . ​ — Luke 2 : 41 - 52 .
Enduring in the Face of Suffering and Loss
Like so many single mothers today , she faced the challenge of caring for her children without the help of a husband .
So much time , effort , and emotion are invested in children that a huge void may seem to linger when they leave .
Mary , no doubt , told them what the angel had told her ​ — that Jesus was “ God’s Son . ”
Such endurance is precious to God , whether other humans respond or not . ​ — 1 Peter 3 : 1 , 2 .
The Hardest Challenge
The death of a child has been described as “ the ultimate loss , ” “ the most devastating death , ” whether the child is still young or he is an adult .
Did Mary let this final test destroy her emotionally or let it weaken her faith in Jehovah ?
* ​ — Acts 1 : 14 .
Does the Bible account of Mary’s unique role justify her being venerated ?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Yes , he did .
Thus , scholar Frank E .
[ Box on page 7 ]
She Had the Courage to Change
Mary was born into a Jewish family , and she followed the Jewish religion .
She attended the local synagogue , as the Jewish place of worship is called , and she visited the temple in Jerusalem .
Jewish religious leaders had her Son , the Messiah , put to death .
God withdrew his blessing from the religious system in which Mary had been raised . ​ — Galatians 2 : 15 , 16 .
Did she reason that she had been born into the Jewish religious system and that she wanted to remain loyal to the traditions of her forefathers ?
Did she say that she was too old to change ?
If Jesus wanted his mother to be revered , he had here a golden opportunity to recommend that form of devotion .
How does this fit in with the adoration that many sincere believers bestow on Mary ?
Do these phrases not indicate that particular reverence is due Mary ?
In reality , no .
What place is that ?
While “ the festival of Pentecost was in progress , ” says the Bible , “ they were all together at the same place ” when God’s holy spirit was poured out upon them , granting them the ability to speak in foreign languages . ​ — Acts 2 : 1 - 4 .
As priests , they will share in applying the merits of Jesus ’ sacrifice to all obedient mankind , raising them to spiritual , moral , and physical perfection .
[ Footnote ]
Do You Fear the Dead ?
Others have fearsome experiences that they attribute to the influence of spirits of the dead .
However , some aspects of spiritism were frightening .
John’s explanation of the condition of the dead was based on the Bible .
Who can best answer this question ?
Rather , Jehovah , the Creator of all life “ in the heavens and upon the earth , the things visible and the things invisible , ” has the answer .
What did that mean ?
They , however , were not the first to die .
Their son Abel was .
Many centuries later , King Herod was agitated when astrologers informed him that a “ king of the Jews ” had been born in his realm .
They were not spirits of dead humans .
Rather , Jesus identified them as “ demons , ” or unclean spirits . ​ — Matthew 8 : 29 - 31 ; 10 : 8 ; Mark 5 : 8 .
Their motives were selfish .
Jehovah , however , prevented them from resuming “ their original position . ”
The Bible states : “ God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned , but , by throwing them into Tartarus , delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment . ” ​ — 2 Peter 2 : 4 .
Agboola has faith that his three sons will be included .
Your loved ones who have died may well be among them .
Associate with those who believe what the Bible teaches .
Agboola no longer fears the dead , and he has learned how to resist the demons .
He says : “ I don’t know who caused the deaths of my three sons .
Fairness .
Sadly , justice often proves to be elusive in today’s world .
There is , however , a Judge who deserves our trust ​ — Jehovah God .
*
God said that he would spare the cities if just 50 righteous men were there .
Was Abraham arguing with God ?
He referred to himself as mere “ dust and ashes . ”
The faithful patriarch voiced his conviction that “ the Judge of all the earth ” would “ do what is right . ” ​ — Verse 25 .
Yes and no .
But he was certainly right in saying that God would never “ sweep away the righteous with the wicked . ”
[ Footnote ]
For another example , see Genesis 16 : 7 - 11 , 13 .
For example , Jonah’s story helps us to see how even those with genuine faith can go astray ​ — and how they can make amends .
* Jonah served as a prophet during the reign of King Jeroboam II of the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel .
So Jonah’s service could not have been easy or pleasant .
Some scholars say that Tarshish was in Spain .
We should not be too quick to judge him .
As we shall see , he was capable of remarkable personal courage .
Like all of us , though , Jonah was an imperfect human struggling with a great many faults .
It may occasionally seem that God asks us to do what strikes us as difficult , even impossible .
How long did it take for that wooden craft to seem terribly small and frail , lost in a watery wilderness of towering waves and plunging canyons ?
Did Jonah know , at that point , what he later wrote ​ — that “ Jehovah himself hurled forth a great wind at the sea ” ?
There , he went fast asleep .
Soon the truth was plain .
He was a servant of the almighty God , Jehovah .
Jonah may have shuddered to think of himself drowning in that cold , wild sea .
But how could he send all these men to such a death when he knew he could save them ?
It must have warmed Jehovah’s heart to see Jonah’s brave , self - sacrificing spirit in that dire moment .
Instead , they did everything they could to work their way through the storm ​ — but to no avail .
The tempest only grew worse .
Calling out to Jonah’s God , Jehovah , to show them mercy , they lifted the man up and hurled him over the side , into the sea . ​ — Jonah 1 : 13 - 15 .
Jonah plummeted into the raging waves .
Perhaps he struggled , floundering a bit , and saw amid a chaos of foam and spray that the ship was swiftly moving away .
He thought with sadness that he would never again see the beautiful temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem .
Without a doubt , it was his God , Jehovah , who had “ appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah . ”
It also shows a heartwarming quality : gratitude .
Jonah learned that salvation is something that Jehovah can bring to anyone , anywhere , anytime .
Only Jehovah could keep a man alive and well for three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish .
Did he learn to show his gratitude to Jehovah through obedience ?
He did .
Imagine ​ — after all that , Jonah did not even have to swim ashore !
Jonah’s origin in a Galilean town is noteworthy because the Pharisees arrogantly said about Jesus : “ Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galilee . ”
Many translators and researchers suggest that the Pharisees were making a sweeping generalization that no prophet ever has arisen or ever does arise out of lowly Galilee .
However , lest we judge Jonah’s sleep as a sign of indifference on his part , we might recall that sometimes an urge to sleep overcomes those who are very low in spirits .
Although there is no way to determine exactly what kind of sea creature was involved , it has been observed that there are sharks in the Mediterranean large enough to swallow a man whole .
When he did not have enough money to pay his bill , the landlord ejected him .
For One with unlimited power , such things would not be difficult at all . ​ — Isaiah 40 : 26 .
Could God not use his power to do far more ?
“ With God no declaration will be an impossibility . ” ​ — LUKE 1 : 37

“ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me . ” ​ — LUKE 9 : 23 .
TOWARD the end of his ministry , Jesus was witnessing in Perea , a region across the Jordan , northeast of Judea .
Indeed , Jesus offered the same invitation to all lovers of righteousness when he said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually . ”
Hence , anyone can be Jesus ’ follower if he really wants to .
How can we avoid drifting away from following Jesus ?
Bearing the answers to those two questions in mind will help us to strengthen our resolve to remain on the fine path we have chosen .
Why Follow Jesus ?
The prophet Jeremiah stated : “ I well know , O Jehovah , that to earthling man his way does not belong .
Who knows better than our Creator whom to appoint as a Leader for us ?
Second , Jesus has qualities that we can admire and imitate .
What is involved in following Jesus ?
( Read Matthew 7 : 21 - 23 . )
7 , 8 . ( a ) What is wisdom , and why did Jesus possess it so abundantly ?
His wisdom originated with Jehovah , so we are not surprised at the soundness of Jesus ’ judgment .
“ Seeking first the kingdom ” brings great happiness and satisfaction . ​ — Matt .
6 : 33 .
What did that involve ?
Jesus enjoyed the glorious privilege of dwelling in his Father’s heavenly presence , but he willingly “ emptied himself . ”
His life was transferred to the womb of a Jewish virgin , there to develop for nine months until he was born as a helpless infant in the household of a lowly carpenter .
What extraordinary humility !
Such work may appear lowly , especially when people respond with apathy , ridicule , or hostility .
Thus we help to save lives .
Another example is the maintenance of our Kingdom Hall .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Jesus demonstrate zeal , and what motivated him ?
In his early life , he likely worked with his adoptive father , Joseph , as a carpenter .
How can we follow his example ?
Old or new , such truths are , indeed , priceless treasures .
( Read Matthew 13 : 52 . )
He constantly directed his hearers to the Scriptures .
In his recorded words , he quoted directly from or referred indirectly to over half of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures .
And when such ones accept the invitation to follow Jesus , our joy is boundless .
His willingness to surrender his soul in mankind’s behalf was the ultimate expression of his love .
He then did something extraordinary .
“ He stretched out his hand and touched him , and said to him : ‘ I want to .
Still , Jesus empathized with the sick even though he himself was never sick .
The more we learn about him , the more we want to be like him ​ — and the more we want to help others to do the same .
• How can we show wisdom , as Jesus did ?
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 5 ]
[ Picture on page 4 ]
“ Go therefore and make disciples . ” ​ — MATT .
“ I HAVE been studying with a family from Pakistan for the past 11 weeks , ” wrote a sister who is serving with a Hindi - speaking group in the United States . “ Needless to say , ” she continues , “ we have become friends .
Tears well up in my eyes as I think about this family going back to Pakistan soon .
Similarly , many today find great joy in making disciples .
One couple from Australia who were temporarily serving in Zambia wrote : “ The stories are true .
People approach us , some even asking for particular issues of the magazines . ”
In other places , however , publishers may find it difficult to place literature and to conduct Bible studies regularly .
Many people have been spiritually injured ​ — skinned and thrown about by false shepherds .
Understandably , such ones may be wary of becoming involved in discussions about the Bible .
Moses said : “ Excuse me , Jehovah , but I am not a fluent speaker , neither since yesterday nor since before that . ”
We might worry that a person will not become a disciple because we are not the perfect teacher .
How can we deal with the challenges just mentioned ?
A first step is to prepare our own heart .
Jesus was motivated in his ministry by a heartfelt concern for the welfare of others .
He said to his disciples : “ The harvest is great . . .
Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest . ” ​ — Matt .
Think , too , of the people we will meet in the ministry and how they will benefit from hearing the message that we bear .
I thank Jehovah and Jesus that these people have come into my life . ”
( Read John 4 : 35 , 36 . )
Rather than seeing only the barren ground between the stalks of grain , can we likewise focus on the potential harvest in our assigned territory ?
For example , have you tried witnessing to people on the street or at their places of employment ?
Could you contact people by telephone or obtain the phone numbers of those with whom you have already shared the Kingdom message so that you can stay in touch with them ?
What if many in your territory are apathetic about religion ?
By learning a foreign language .
You can also usually obtain literature in the language of the people whom you meet .
Granted , it requires extra time and effort to communicate with those of another language and culture .
However , making disciples is not dependent on the efforts of just one individual .
Rather , it is a congregation effort .
Why ?
Jesus said : “ By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ”
Jesus said that those who become his followers may be opposed by their literal family .
How can we overcome the fear of failure ?
14 : 12 .
What Are the Rewards ?
( b ) How does Jehovah view all who engage in the preaching work ?
What a cause for joy that would be !
What assurances do we find in God’s Word ?
We find an answer in the book of First Peter .
“ God’s Undeserved Kindness Expressed in Various Ways ”
Peter states : “ In proportion as each one has received a gift , use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways . ”
It implies that whatever the nature of our trial may be , there will always be an expression of God’s undeserved kindness that will match it .
Hence , each one in the congregation is to have a share in building fellow Christians up .
We have been placed in charge of something valuable belonging to Jehovah , and we are responsible for distributing it to others .
How do we “ use it in ministering to one another ” ?
God’s Word states : “ Every good gift and every perfect present is from above . ”
“ Use It in Ministering ” ​ — How ?
( Compare 1 Timothy 5 : 9 , 10 . )
God’s Word mentions various ways in which first - century Christians ministered to one another .
Many brothers spend hours each month preparing meeting parts .
The tender affection and practical assistance rendered by such caring brothers and sisters are all manifestations of “ God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways . ” ​ — Read 1 Peter 4 : 11 .
The apostle Paul recognized these two aspects of his service to Jehovah .
Yet , he also stated : “ We have been proved by God as fit to be entrusted with the good news . ”
Asking a question like that is somewhat similar to asking about a bird , Which of his two wings is more important ?
In both activities ​ — preaching to the public and “ ministering to one another ” — ​ we have the wonderful privilege of serving as an instrument in Jehovah’s hand . ​ — Gal .
What would happen if we held back in “ ministering to one another ” ?
In showing honor to one another take the lead . ”
Indeed , having affection for our brothers impels us to serve wholeheartedly as stewards of God’s undeserved kindness .
When they learned that Hurricane Katrina had destroyed hundreds of homes of fellow Witnesses , brotherly love moved them to quit their jobs , give up their apartment , buy a secondhand trailer , fix it up , and travel 900 miles [ 1,400 km ] to Louisiana .
Ryan adds : “ Working with older brothers taught me much about how to care for the brothers .
The ones we help are spiritually strengthened , while we experience the heartfelt joy that only giving can bring .
Furthermore , the love and affection that we show for one another clearly identifies us as true Christians .
Jesus said : “ By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ”
• With what are we entrusted ?
AS THE time to commemorate Christ’s death approaches , God’s people do well to follow the apostle Paul’s counsel to “ look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith , Jesus . ”
They will enhance our understanding of the Memorial , which we will be commemorating this year on Thursday , April 9 , after sundown .
The Servant Identified
3 , 4 . ( a ) In the book of Isaiah , what does the word “ servant ” designate ?
Philip lost no time in explaining that Isaiah spoke about the Messiah , Jesus . ​ — Acts 8 : 26 - 35 .
While Jesus was yet a babe , a righteous man named Simeon declared under the power of the holy spirit that “ the young child Jesus ” would become “ a light for removing the veil from the nations , ” as foretold at Isaiah 42 : 6 and 49 : 6 .
Furthermore , the humiliating treatment meted out to Jesus on the night of his trial was foretold in the prophecy of Isaiah 50 : 6 - 9 .
During all that time , Jehovah’s Servant listened to his Father and learned from him , becoming a submissive disciple .
As was foretold in Isaiah’s prophecy , Jesus was able to say : “ The One declaring me righteous is near .
Who can contend with me ? . . .
The Servant’s Ministry on Earth
During his earthly ministry , Jesus fulfilled this prophecy in a remarkable way .
12 : 15 - 21 .
The common people among the Jews were despised by the Jewish religious leaders .
3 : 13 ; Dan .
“ A Light ” and “ a Covenant ”
In fulfillment of Isaiah 42 : 6 , Jesus did indeed prove to be “ a light of the nations . ”
That work is still being pursued as Jesus ’ anointed brothers on earth and their companions spread spiritual light and help people to put faith in Jesus , the “ light of the nations . ”
In that same prophecy , Jehovah told his chosen Servant : “ I shall safeguard you and give you as a covenant of the people . ”
That solemn promise provided assurance that God’s faithful Servant would continue as “ a light of the nations , ” liberating those in spiritual darkness . ​ — Read Isaiah 49 : 8 , 9 .
In harmony with this pledge , Jehovah’s chosen Servant would “ open the blind eyes , ” “ bring forth out of the dungeon the prisoner , ” and deliver “ those sitting in darkness . ”
In a similar way , Jesus has brought spiritual deliverance to millions of non - Jews .
From his heavenly position , Christ Jesus is overseeing the global preaching work .
Jehovah Elevated the “ Servant ”
Why and how did Jehovah elevate his Servant ?
In view of his Son’s loyal submission to His sovereignty and his faithfulness under the most extreme test , Jehovah elevated him .
What have we learned thus far by studying Isaiah’s prophecies regarding the “ servant ” ?
As we shall next see , another prophecy regarding the Messianic Servant reveals that he would suffer and pour out his life for our benefit , matters we should “ consider closely ” as the Memorial of his death approaches . ​ — Heb .
You can find these prophecies at Isaiah 42 : 1 - 7 ; 49 : 1 - 12 ; 50 : 4 - 9 ; and 52 : 13 – 53 : 12 .
[ Picture on page 21 ]
Philip clearly identified the “ servant ” mentioned by Isaiah as Jesus , the Messiah
[ Picture on page 23 ]
As Jehovah’s chosen Servant , Jesus showed compassion for the poor and afflicted
The Memorial reminds us of the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty , the sanctification of his name , and the fulfillment of his purpose , including the salvation of mankind .
Isaiah foretold the Servant’s sufferings and provided specific details about Christ’s death and about the blessings his death would result in for his anointed brothers and his “ other sheep . ” ​ — John 10 : 16 .
This very fact is proof of Jehovah’s absolute confidence in his Son’s loyalty .
Why should the Jews have welcomed Jesus , but how did they receive him ?
Read Isaiah 53 : 3 .
The apostle John wrote : “ He came to his own home , but his own people did not take him in . ”
Isaiah also prophesied that Jesus was meant to have “ acquaintance with sickness . ”
During his ministry , Jesus certainly got tired on occasion , but there is no indication that he got sick .
He did , however , become acquainted with the sicknesses of those to whom he preached .
He felt pity for them and healed many .
Many of Jesus ’ contemporaries did not understand the reason for his suffering and death .
26 : 39 .
To understand this part of the prophecy , we should remember that in challenging Jehovah’s sovereignty , Satan cast doubt on the loyalty of all of God’s servants in heaven and on earth .
Read Isaiah 53 : 6 .
Being imperfect , not one of Adam’s descendants could buy back what Adam had forfeited .
By consenting to be “ pierced for our transgression ” and “ crushed for our errors , ” Christ carried our sins upon the stake and died in our place .
When John the Baptizer saw Jesus approaching , he exclaimed : “ See , the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world ! ”
Like Isaac of old , Jesus was willing to be offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of Jehovah’s will for him .
1 : 19 , 20 .
( a ) Who are “ the things in the heavens ” mentioned by Paul ?
All Thanks to Jehovah and His Approved Servant !
We have learned that God’s Son is not rebellious .
We have seen that during Jesus ’ earthly ministry , he showed compassion for the people to whom he preached , healing many of them both physically and spiritually .
The zeal he showed in preaching the Kingdom , as “ a light of the nations , ” is a reminder to his followers to preach the good news zealously throughout the earth . ​ — Isa .
As we gather together for the Memorial , may our hearts be filled with gratitude to Jehovah and to his faithful Servant .
The Story of Emilia Pederson
As told by Ruth E .
Although she became a schoolteacher , she really wanted to use her life helping people draw close to God .
Evidence of Mother’s desire was a large trunk sitting in our home in the small town of Jasper , Minnesota , U.S.A .
In 1916 , Mom heard that Charles Taze Russell would be at a convention in Sioux City , Iowa .
She wanted to attend .
By this time , Mom had five children , and Marvin , the youngest , was only five months old .
Upon returning home , she wrote an article about the convention , which was published in the Jasper Journal .
When I was about seven years old , my aunt Lettie phoned and said that her neighbors , Ed Larson and his wife , wanted to study the Bible .
Gordon had been warned : “ Be careful with the boss’s daughters .
The one in Columbus , Ohio , in 1931 was momentous because it was then that the name Jehovah’s Witnesses was adopted .
Eunice married Leo Van Daalen in 1940 , and they became pioneers .
That same year , Lilian married Gordon Kammerud , and they too became pioneers .
That convention was a turning point for me .
In our farming community , it was difficult for all the brothers to attend the conventions because these were often held during harvesttime .
In February 1943 , Gilead School was established for the training of pioneers for missionary service .
We said our farewells with mixed emotions , since we did not know when we would see them again .
Although learning Spanish was a challenge , soon some of us were conducting more than 20 Bible studies each .
On April 11 , they left by airplane .
Some 600 attended the funeral talk , and a fine witness was given to the community , where Father was well - respected .
She married Dennis Trumbore , and they have shared in the full - time ministry ever since .
Mark and his wife , Lavonne , pioneered for years and reared their four children in “ the way . ” ​ — Isa .
He is still faithfully serving Jehovah .
What Mom Left
Mom never fulfilled her desire to be a missionary .
21 : 3 , 4 .
See The Watchtower , June 15 , 1983 , pages 27 - 30 , for the life story of Emil H .

Highlights From the Book of Revelation ​ — I
Those who read the account of these visions with faith are indeed comforted and encouraged . ​ — Heb .
4 : 2 ; 5 : 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 .
Thus , the message to “ the seven congregations ” ultimately applies to all of God’s people gathered together in more than 100,000 congregations earth wide .
10 : 7 .
Although Jehovah is referred to as “ the first and the last ” at Revelation 22 : 13 , in that there is none before or after him , the context in the first chapter of Revelation shows that the title “ the First and the Last ” there applies to Jesus Christ .
24 : 45 , 47 .
This name has to do with Jesus ’ new office and privileges .
Lessons for Us :
1 : 3 .
We also need to put on “ white outer garments , ” which proclaim our identity as followers of Christ , and use “ eyesalve , ” such as counsel published in the Watchtower magazine , to gain spiritual discernment . ​ — Rev .
The 24 elders represent the 144,000 in their heavenly glory , where they serve not only as kings but also as priests .
They were pictured by the priests in ancient Israel , whom King David organized in 24 divisions .
( Rev .
Seven angels receive seven trumpets .
Six of the angels blow their trumpets , heralding judgment messages on “ a third ” of mankind ​ — Christendom .
10 : 10 ; 11 : 1 , 15 .
The seventh vision enlarges on what is stated at Revelation 11 : 15 , 17 .
In response to their prayers , the angel hurled to the earth a symbolic fire that set the anointed Christians afire spiritually .
Though few in number , they began a worldwide preaching campaign that made God’s Kingdom a burning issue , thus lighting a fire in Christendom .
8 : 13 ; 9 : 12 ; 11 : 14 ​ — In what way are the final three trumpet blasts “ woes ” ?
The fifth blast is related to the release of God’s people from “ the abyss ” of inactivity in 1919 and to their relentless witnessing work , which became like a tormenting plague on Christendom .
Many meek people who live in so - called non - Christian nations have responded well to the message we proclaim .

Jehovah’s Servant ​ — “ Pierced for Our Transgression ”
SONGS TO BE USED : 224 , 214
It also requires that we be zealous in making disciples .
These two articles examine several prophecies found in the book of Isaiah that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ .
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE :
PAGE 17
John : * Before my parents punished me for some wrongdoing , they would put forth real effort to understand my motive and the circumstances involved .
Her father and mother were more impulsive .
They seem to have chastised their children without being concerned about the circumstances surrounding an incident .
He showed no interest in me or my three siblings .
My mom worked very hard to provide for us , and I shouldered a lot of responsibility in caring for my younger sisters .
When my own children need discipline , I agonize over their mistakes .
Tension can be exacerbated by exhaustion .
When tired parents clash over how to train a child , small disputes might explode into major arguments .
Marriage should exist before the children arrive , and it is intended to remain long after they leave home .
Certainly , parents need to invest time in training their children , but they do well to remember that a strong marriage is the best foundation upon which to do so .
Admittedly , making time to spend together as a couple is not easy .
Alison , the mother referred to earlier , says , “ Just when it seems that my husband and I might have a few moments together , our youngest daughter demands attention or our six - year - old experiences some ‘ crisis , ’ like not being able to find her crayons . ”
When the bell sounds , put the child to bed without further concessions .
Let your “ Yes mean Yes , your No , No . ” ​ — Matthew 5 : 37 .
How can parents deal with that challenge ?
However , he admits that presenting a united front is more easily said than done .
Alison says : “ If I disagree with the way my husband is disciplining our daughter , I wait until she is out of hearing range before I offer my input .
I don’t want her to think that she can ‘ divide and conquer ’ by playing on our different points of view .
How can you prevent disagreements about child training from building resentment between you and your mate ​ — and , as a consequence , undermining your children’s respect for you ?
At times , the task may seem to be all - consuming .
My respect and love for him have grown as I’ve watched the way he lovingly cared for our girls . ”
What better example could you set for your children ?
Names have been changed .
How much time do I spend with my mate each week without the children around ?
But her joy turns to grief when she sees the child lie motionless .
When the grandmother takes the limp little body to bathe it , the boy suddenly begins to move and breathe and cry !
While hiding in a field , the man vows that if God saves him , he will call his firstborn Manirakiza , meaning “ God Is the Savior . ”
GIVING children names that have a specific meaning may seem unusual to some , but this custom has ancient roots .
Understanding the meaning of various individuals ’ names will enhance your Bible reading .
Consider just some examples .
Meaningful Names in the Hebrew Scriptures
Among the first names recorded in the Bible is that of Seth , meaning “ Appointed . ”
God himself changed the names of certain adults for prophetic purposes .
Consider , too , Abraham’s wife , Sarai , possibly meaning “ Contentious . ”
Isaac’s daughter - in - law Rachel gave her last son his name for a very different reason .
Whether these names were given at birth or later is not stated , but they seem to be fitting , given the early demise of these two young men . ​ — Ruth 1 : 5 .
On returning to Bethlehem , destitute after losing her husband and sons , Naomi no longer wanted to be called by that name , meaning “ My Pleasantness . ”
Yet another custom was to name a child in honor of a significant event .
After Jesus was anointed with holy spirit at his baptism , his name was combined with the Hebrew designation “ Messiah . ”
In Greek , this same title is rendered “ Christ . ”
One example is that of the disciple Joseph , whom the apostles named Barnabas , meaning “ Son of Comfort . ”
How so ?
[ Footnote ]
Many of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Africa have names that are connected with the titles of Witness conventions and assemblies held when they were born .
However , the Gospel writer Matthew showed that Isaiah’s prophecy was completely fulfilled in Jesus . ​ — Matthew 1 : 22 , 23 .
Some have claimed that by applying the name Immanuel to Jesus , the Bible teaches that Jesus is God .
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 15 ]
What is the significance of that name ?

The repetition of memorized prayers does not please God .
Jesus prayed for others . The Bible tells us : “ Young children were brought to him , for him to put his hands upon them and offer prayer . ”
“ Keep on asking , and it will be given you , ” said Jesus .
Rather , Jesus said : “ If you , although being wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him ! ” ​ — Luke 11 : 5 - 13 .
At the critical moment , God intervened by means of an angel .
Abraham evidently kept the details of the test to himself .
But Abraham’s resolve did not weaken .
Why ?
“ Before God , ” explains one scholar , “ the willingness was reckoned as equal to the deed . ”
And Abraham’s confidence in Jehovah was rewarded , for God repeated and enlarged upon his covenant with Abraham , which covenant promised blessings for people of all the nations . ​ — Verses 15 - 18 .

Josiah was the son of Amon , a king of Judah , who was only 16 years old when Josiah was born .
The Bible does not say how much contact Manasseh had with his grandson Josiah .
Did Josiah choose to follow the bad example of his father , Amon , or the good example of his repentant grandfather , Manasseh ? —
Josiah was influenced by the prophet Zephaniah .
What do you think you can learn from studying about Josiah ? — If you , like him , do not have a father who serves Jehovah , is there someone else who can help you learn about God ?
Whatever the case , although Josiah was only a child , he was old enough to know that he should make friends with people who serve Jehovah .
In contrast , Jehovah’s Witnesses do not use any form of idol or icon in their worship .
Instead , they associated it with the worship of Jehovah .
True , God has overlooked the times of such ignorance , yet now he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses obey God’s clear direction not to use images of any sort when they worship him .
[ Blurb on page 31 ]
With his disciples and others present , he sits down on a mountainside and begins teaching . ​ — Matt .
Happiness is ‘ a state of well - being ranging from contentment to intense joy . ’
The nine happinesses that Jesus pronounced highlight why Christians are happy , and these sayings are as beneficial today as they were nearly 2,000 years ago .
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why are those conscious of their spiritual need happy ?
How should we feel about Satan’s world ?
8 , 9 .
Such meekness harmonizes with the apostle Paul’s counsel . ​ — Read Romans 12 : 17 - 19 .
Like Jesus , we should be mild - tempered .
But what if we are known for having a belligerent spirit ?
Such an aggressive and hostile attitude may cause people to shy away from us .
( b ) How are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness “ filled ” ?
The “ righteousness ” that Jesus had in mind is the quality of doing what is right by conforming to God’s will and commandments .
The psalmist said that he was “ crushed with longing ” for God’s righteous judicial decisions .
Do we prize righteousness so much that we hunger and thirst for it ?
This became possible after Pentecost 33 C.E . , for Jehovah’s holy spirit then began to “ give the world convincing evidence concerning . . . righteousness . ”
Meanwhile , let us be determined to live in harmony with Jehovah’s standards .
We can show mercy in that way and by our kind words and deeds that bring relief to disadvantaged individuals .
We have reason to agree with Jesus ’ statement : “ Happy are the merciful , since they will be shown mercy . ”
Forgiveness of sins and eternal life are only for the merciful . ​ — Matt .
We will display “ love out of a clean heart . ”
If we are pure in heart , what we say and do will have the mark of purity , and there will be nothing hypocritical about our service to Jehovah .
How do “ the peaceable ” conduct themselves ?
“ The peaceable ” are identified by what they will do and by what they will not do .
If we are the kind of people whom Jesus had in mind , we are peaceable and ‘ do not render injury for injury to anyone . ’
The Greek term rendered “ peaceable ” at Matthew 5 : 9 literally means “ peacemakers . ”
They already have an intimate relationship with Jehovah as his children because they exercise faith in Christ and wholeheartedly worship “ the God of love and of peace . ”
They will have Jesus as their “ Eternal Father ” during his Millennial Reign , but at its end he will subject himself to Jehovah and they will become children of God in a complete sense . ​ — John 10 : 16 ; Isa .
Instead , we endeavor to be “ peaceable with all men . ” ​ — Rom .
Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens ; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ” ​ — Matt .
Like God’s prophets of old , Christians expect to be reproached , persecuted , and lyingly spoken against ​ — all “ for righteousness ’ sake . ”
Our suffering cannot diminish our delight in serving Jehovah now or in the future .

ONE of the largest cut diamonds known today is the 530 - carat Star of Africa .
Far more valuable , however , are the spiritual gems found in Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount . No wonder , for the sayings of Christ have Jehovah as their Source !
Referring to Jesus , the Bible says : “ The one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God . ” ​ — John 3 : 34 - 36 .
Although the Sermon on the Mount may have been given in less than half an hour , it contained 21 quotations from eight books of the Hebrew Scriptures .
As Christians , we are happy and peaceable because we have God’s holy spirit , and its fruitage includes joy and peace .
5 : 23 , 24 .
4 , 5 . ( a ) What was the “ gift ” referred to in Jesus ’ statement recorded at Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ?
For example , animal sacrifices were important because they were then part of the worship rendered to Jehovah by his people .
“ Make your peace ” means ‘ to bring about a reconciliation . ’
Humility Must Play a Role
Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded ? ” ​ — 1 Cor .
Our objective should be to restore peaceful relations .
We also need to acknowledge that the other person’s feelings have been hurt .
In his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus gave sound counsel on morality .
He knew that our imperfect body members can have a dangerous influence on us .
To avoid sexual immorality , we need to be guided by God’s holy spirit , which produces self - control in those who love God . ​ — Gal .
To avoid sexual immorality , we might do well to ask ourselves , ‘ Do I allow my eyes to arouse in me an appetite for immoral material readily found in books , on television , or on the Internet ? ’
What counsel of Paul can help us to fight against immoral desires ?
Why is it vital to avoid immoral thoughts and acts ?
Because of inherited sin and imperfection , maintaining moral cleanness requires effort .
“ I pummel my body and lead it as a slave , ” said Paul , “ that , after I have preached to others , I myself should not become disapproved somehow . ”
Let us therefore be determined to apply Jesus ’ counsel on morality , never allowing ourselves to act in ways that show a lack of gratitude for his ransom sacrifice . ​ — Matt .
6 : 4 - 6 .
15 , 16 . ( a ) How did Jesus set an example in giving ?
He displayed great generosity in coming to the earth for the benefit of imperfect mankind .
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 9 . )
And Jesus certainly encouraged generosity when he said :
For with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you in return . ”
11 : 2 .
Truly I say to you , They are having their reward in full . ”
We are not to publicize such giving , as the Jewish Pharisees did .
Repayment from the One “ looking on in secret ” includes what ?
Residing in the heavens and invisible to human eyes , our heavenly Father remains “ in secret ” as far as mankind is concerned .
Why should we cherish Jesus ’ sayings ?
• What should be our attitude with regard to giving ?
Why were the crowds astounded at Jesus ’ way of teaching ?
He certainly spoke like no other man .
Why , people were amazed at the way he taught in the Sermon on the Mount ! ​ — Read Matthew 7 : 28 , 29 .
4 - 6 . ( a ) Why did the Pharisees like to pray “ standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways ” ?
Many residents of Jerusalem would pray along with a crowd of worshippers in the temple precincts .
Since most people were not near the temple or a synagogue for the prayers just mentioned , they might pray wherever they happened to be at those times .
They greatly desired recognition and praise from fellow humans ​ — and that was all they would get .
It would be wrong for us to mimic the repetitious prayers of “ people of the nations . ”
“ Over and over again , ” they repeat memorized phrases that include many unnecessary words .
“ So , do not make yourselves like them , for God your Father knows what things you are needing before ever you ask him . ”
When we pray , we should remember that we are addressing the One who ‘ knows what we need before ever we ask him . ’
Jesus ’ sayings about unacceptable prayers should remind us that God is not impressed by high - sounding speech and superfluous words .
We should also realize that public prayer is not an occasion to try to impress listeners or cause them to wonder how long it will be before we say “ Amen . ”
Although Jesus warned against abusing the grand privilege of prayer , he did teach his disciples how to pray .
The model prayer is not to be memorized in order to be recited over and over again .
( b ) What will the doing of God’s will on earth involve ?
This request for our daily needs may remind us that God commanded the Israelites to gather manna “ each his amount day for day . ” ​ — Ex .
4 : 32 ; Col .
How are we to understand the requests regarding temptation and deliverance from the wicked one ?
One thing is certain : Jehovah does not tempt us to commit sin .
Satan ​ — “ the wicked one ” — ​ is the real “ Tempter . ”
19 , 20 .
Jesus likened God to a loving father who provides good things for his offspring .
Imagine that you were present for the Sermon on the Mount and heard Jesus say : “ Who is the man among you whom his son asks for bread ​ — he will not hand him a stone , will he ?
Or , perhaps , he will ask for a fish ​ — he will not hand him a serpent , will he ?
Therefore , if you , although being wicked , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him ? ” ​ — Matt .
A human father , although comparatively “ wicked ” because of inherited sin , has natural affection for his offspring .
What is noteworthy about the Sermon on the Mount , and how do you feel about these sayings of Jesus ?
• How can we ‘ keep on asking , seeking , and knocking ’ ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
You have sayings of everlasting life ; and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God . ”
There are many reasons why the slave class deserves our trust .
To what extent does Jehovah trust the faithful slave ?
“ The trumpet will sound , ” wrote the apostle Paul , “ and the dead will be raised up incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
Revelation 4 : 4 describes these resurrected ones as seated upon thrones with golden crowns upon their heads .
“ The marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself .
The Slave Is Trusted by Jesus
How does Jesus show that he has confidence in his spirit - anointed followers ?
Has this promise proved reliable ?
11 , 12 .
For example , the Watchtower magazine has been published for some 130 years .
Those of the great crowd should never be ashamed to identify themselves as companions of the “ partakers of the heavenly calling . ”
( Read Matthew 25 : 40 . )
In what way , then , can those who have the earthly hope support Christ’s spirit - anointed brothers ?
Principally by helping them with the Kingdom - preaching work .
Such ones must listen to Jesus .
The faithful and discreet slave today is represented by the Governing Body , who take the lead and coordinate the Kingdom - preaching work throughout the earth .
They in particular can be described as “ those who are taking the lead ” among us .
In caring for over 7,000,000 Kingdom proclaimers worldwide in over 100,000 congregations , these anointed overseers have “ plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ”
Those Who Listen to the Slave Are Blessed
“ God himself will be with them , ” says the Bible .
“ And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore .
What Did You Learn ?
[ Picture on page 25 ]
Jesus Christ has entrusted the faithful and discreet slave with his “ belongings ”
* ​ — Heb .
13 : 1 .
Evidently , Jehovah himself commands these angels to pour out “ the seven bowls of the anger of God ” on various features of Satan’s world .
The bowls contain pronouncements and warnings of the judgments God will execute .
This poisonous air is breathed by Satan’s entire wicked system of things . ​ — Eph .
2 : 2 .
13 : 16 , 17 .
The angelic proclamation teaches us that we should declare the good news of the established Kingdom of God with urgency .
16 : 13 - 16 .
“ Unclean inspired expressions ” symbolize demonic propaganda intended to ensure that the kings of the earth are not swayed by the pouring out of the seven bowls of God’s anger but instead are maneuvered into opposition to Jehovah . ​ — Matt .
Still , most of mankind will continue to blaspheme God .
What about “ the original serpent , who is the Devil and Satan ” ?
That is one of the subjects of the 14th vision .
After the destruction of Babylon the Great , the kings of the earth evidently come to realize how useful she was to them .
2 : 26 , 27 .
Lessons for Us :
Should not the unraveling of this mystery move us to be zealous in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom and proclaiming the day of Jehovah’s judgment ?

Should You Insist on Your Personal Preferences ?
Unless we do so , we can easily stumble others and weaken our relationship with Jehovah . ​ — Rom .
Am I prepared to conform to Bible principles , even when it is inconvenient to do so ? ’
In Choosing Employment
But consider the experience of a businessman from a small town in South America .
Although he had a large family to support , he stopped selling alcohol .
They zealously preach the good news with freeness of speech .
In Choosing Associates
Is socializing with those who do not share our faith simply a question of personal preference , or are Bible principles involved ?
While associating with unbelievers may not always result in a tragedy such as that , the Bible warns : “ He that is walking with wise persons will become wise , but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly . ”
In Dress and Grooming
However , Bible principles about dress and grooming remain constant .
2 : 4 .
Paul counseled Christians to be willing to give something up rather than to take a brother to court .
18 : 15 - 17 .
Sadly , the issue still could not be resolved .
Noticing that the family was searching for adequate seating , the pioneer couple gave up their two seats .
A few days after the convention , the pioneers received a thank - you letter from the family .
The letter explained how discouraged they were when they arrived at the convention late .
When we have the opportunity , let us willingly forgo our preferences in behalf of others .
Dancers sway to the rhythm of pulsating music .
This belief is interwoven with numerous funeral customs .
The Bible clearly states : “ The living are conscious that they will die ; but as for the dead , they are conscious of nothing at all . . .
These inspired Bible verses make it clear that when someone dies , he is no longer conscious .
He cannot think , feel , communicate , or comprehend anything .
“ Quit Touching the Unclean Thing ”
Regardless of their ethnic or cultural background , Jehovah’s Witnesses strictly avoid any customs associated with the belief that the dead are conscious and can influence the living .
Such customs as wake keeping , funeral celebrations , funeral anniversaries , sacrifices for the dead , and widowhood rites are all unclean and displeasing to God because they are linked to the unscriptural , demonic teaching that the soul or spirit does not die .
True Christians “ cannot be partaking of ‘ the table of Jehovah ’ and the table of demons , ” so they do not share in these customs .
They obey the command : “ Separate yourselves , . . . and quit touching the unclean thing . ”
At times , unbelievers have forcibly taken over Christian funeral arrangements .
Make Your Stand Clear
What happens at a Christian funeral should not disturb the consciences of fellow believers or stumble others who know what we believe and teach about the dead .
But what if unbelieving relatives still insist on introducing unclean rites into the arrangements ?
Then the believing family may decide to withdraw from the funeral .
Even though the body of the deceased is not present , such an arrangement would be dignified and entirely acceptable .
How the funeral should be conducted , where it should take place , and who should have the sole authority to organize and hold it are important details that need to be put in writing .
Most effective is a document that is signed and witnessed .
22 : 3 ; Eccl .
9 : 12 .
The corpse may be removed from the coffin and displayed on a specially decorated bed .
Great care must be exercised so that we are not drawn into an unchristian spirit of competition , trying to outdo others .
If this were to happen at a Christian funeral , great reproach would be brought upon Jehovah’s name and his people . ​ — 1 Pet .
1 : 14 - 16 .
Knowing the true condition of the dead should certainly give us the courage to conduct our funerals without any trace of worldliness .
Therefore , knowing that funeral merrymaking is associated with spiritistic beliefs and immoral activity makes it most inappropriate for true Christians to organize or even attend such celebrations .
Such a hope will prevent us from being carried away by the excessive displays of grief often seen among those “ who have no hope . ”
3 : 13 , 14 .
Our faithful compliance with Scriptural principles will give people the opportunity to ‘ see the distinction between those serving God and those not serving him . ’
3 : 14 .

He then listed four things that build credibility : having the right attitude , setting a good example , basing one’s teaching solidly on God’s Word , and focusing on making Jehovah’s name known .
David Schafer , who serves with the Teaching Committee , discussed the topic “ Will You Understand Everything ? ”
Gerald Grizzle of the Convention Office interviewed three brothers attending the School for Branch Committee Members .
And if you can’t count the ten , it means that you don’t know the person well enough . ”
You will be surprised at how Jehovah will help you . ”
As they bear witness in their assignment , their credibility will enhance their testimony . ​ — Isa .

“ HOLY , holy , holy is Jehovah . ”
‘ Could such a holy God really care about me ​ — a sinful , imperfect human ? ’
God said : “ Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work ; because I well know the pains they suffer . ”
Notice that God said : “ I well know the pains they suffer . ”
He did not merely look with pity or hear with compassion .
Jehovah has not changed .
God’s compassion gives us reason for hope .
She says : “ If Jehovah can make even the dirt holy , then maybe there is a little hope for me .
For Our Young People
Instructions : Do this exercise in quiet surroundings .
ANALYZE THE SCENE . ​ — READ JOHN 11 : 1 - 45 .
What emotion ( s ) do you see in Martha when you read verse 21 and in Mary when you read verse 32 ?
Why did Jesus resurrect people even though they would only die again ?

․ ․ ․ ․ ․
The Most Important Date in History
It is the date on which Jesus Christ died .
You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home .

“ I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize . ” ​ — PHIL .
He then looked forward to the prize of eternal life that was held out to him ​ — that of being an immortal king and priest in God’s heavenly Kingdom .
How highly did Paul value the prize of heavenly life ?
Why , for that matter , I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord .
He said : “ Happy are the mild - tempered ones , since they will inherit the earth . ”
And we are guaranteed that this will all come to pass because God , who promises it , “ cannot lie . ”
Life in God’s new world will not be like today’s unsatisfying existence .
In another instance , Jesus encountered “ a man blind from birth ” and healed him .
As an example , a 12 - year - old girl had died , causing great sorrow to her parents .
Additionally , the painful things of their past life in this old world “ will not be called to mind , neither will they come up into the heart . ”
Those past experiences can be put out of their minds .
“ No resident will say : ‘ I am sick . ’ ”
Try putting yourself in the picture .
Indeed , “ Solomon’s wisdom was vaster than the wisdom of all the Orientals and than all the wisdom of Egypt . ” ​ — 1 Ki .
Increasing his horses would show that the king depended upon military might to protect the nation instead of depending on Jehovah , the Protector .
Solomon engaged in the disgusting false worship of the pagan nations that his foreign wives had introduced him to .
Give examples of men who lost focus on what was truly important .
But “ he was a thief and had the money box and used to carry off the monies put in it . ”
3 : 1 , 13 .
This world under Satan is like a sinking ship . Jehovah has provided the Christian congregation as a “ lifeboat ” for his faithful servants .
• On what basis will those who will live forever on earth be judged ?
“ Be Vigilant ”
Be vigilant with a view to prayers . ” ​ — 1 PET .
4 : 7 .
Thus , Jesus taught his disciples to pray to God : “ Let your kingdom come .
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also upon earth . ”
That Kingdom government is very shortly going to bring an end to Satan’s world and then supervise the doing of God’s will throughout the earth .
A visible sign would be provided in view of the fact that Christ’s presence in Kingdom power would be invisible to those on earth .
Why would Christians need to be vigilant ?
Jesus ’ followers would need to be vigilant , watchful of world events indicating that he was present in Kingdom power .
Since 1925 , Jehovah’s Witnesses have recognized that World War I and the events that followed amount to sure evidence that Christ’s presence in heavenly Kingdom power began in 1914 .
Many observant people , though not knowing the meaning , recognize the dramatic difference between the period before World War I and the period since . ​ — See the box “ The Age of Turbulence Began . ”
True Christians are told to keep on the watch .
The number of people proclaiming the good news was very small when the last days began in 1914 .
That was a significant increase in attendance over the preceding year .
The success of the Kingdom - preaching work and the growth and spiritual prosperity of Jehovah’s people can be described as a miracle .
That is when Jehovah will unleash his executional forces to destroy every vestige of Satan’s earthly system . ​ — Rev .
11 , 12 .
Bible prophecy does not give a date for the first phase of the great tribulation to begin , though it does tell us what extraordinary event will signal its start .
And throughout these last days , they have been telling people about it .
It will be a great shock for people to see false religion destroyed .
Why do we need to adhere closely to God’s counsel ?
As God’s servants , we know this , and we do not want to allow anything to undermine our loyalty to God .
Those words had an initial fulfillment with the restoration of God’s ancient people to their homeland , giving us confidence in the coming literal fulfillment in the new world .
• What was the theme of Jesus ’ teaching ?
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 16 , 17 ]
Greenspan highlights the marked contrast between the world situation before 1914 and what followed :
The pace of global invention had advanced throughout the nineteenth century , bringing railroads , the telephone , the electric light , cinema , the motor car , and household conveniences too numerous to mention .
The sense of the irreversibility of such progress was universal . ”
Will terror , global warming , or resurgent populism do to the current era of life - advancing globalization what World War I did to the previous one ?
Anderson ( 1886 - 1949 ) : “ Those who have an adult’s recollection and an adult’s understanding of the world which preceded World War I look back upon it with a great nostalgia .
There was a sense of security then which has never since existed . ” ​ — Economics and the Public Welfare .
“ Praise Jah , you people ! ” ​ — PS .
What does “ Hallelujah ” mean , and how is it used in the Christian Greek Scriptures ?
That exclamation is commonly heard in Christendom’s churches .
What is the main purpose of our congregating regularly ?
Jehovah’s creations abound with wonderful purpose .
He set sun , earth , and moon in place , all in proper relation one to another , so that our earth is provided with warmth and light , night and day , the seasons and the tides .
What have advances in man’s understanding of the universe revealed ?
Another great expression of creation is the way that God made us .
There is , for example , the miracle involved in the God - given abilities of speaking and listening , as well as those of writing and reading .
Many people have those abilities .
You also have a wondrous masterpiece of construction ​ — the upright human frame .
Beyond that , the amazing nerve connections that enable your mind and your senses to function find no parallel in what scientists have achieved .
In fact , human achievements are possible only because of the mind and senses with which mankind is endowed .
God’s Great Works and His Qualities
Why should we view the Bible as one of God’s great works ?
( b ) What are some of God’s qualities that you appreciate ?
That is evident from the fiendish weapons men produce for the wars they foment and for economic gain .
Also , many human works have been accomplished at the expense of the oppressed poor .
As for graciousness , that has been manifested in the patient manner in which God has dealt with sinful humans .
Faithful to His Promises
That nation was long enslaved in Egypt , but then “ God remembered his covenant with Abraham ” and delivered them .
The majority of the Jews rejected Jesus and allowed him to be executed .
3 : 16 , 29 ; 6 : 16 .
How does Jehovah continue to “ remember his covenant ” with Abraham ?
25 : 6 - 8 .
13 , 14 . ( a ) What display of God’s power in connection with Babylon might the psalmist have had in mind ?
We are well - aware , though , that despite all Jehovah did in their behalf , Israel did not show respect for him nor for their ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
They kept rebelling until God used Babylon to remove them , taking them into exile .
15 , 16 . ( a ) What are included among the works of God’s hands ?
20 : 5 , 6 , 12 , 15 , 17 .
In line with that , Jehovah did not abandon his people first as slaves in ancient Egypt and later as captives in Babylon .
The same is true of Christians today , who have been redeemed from hopeless slavery to sin and death .
We should do our very best to live in harmony with the first request in the model prayer : “ Let your name be sanctified . ”
111 : 10 .
A wholesome fear of God will help us to hate what is bad .
He deserves nothing less .
Questions for Meditation
Our main purpose in congregating regularly is to praise Jehovah
[ Picture on page 23 ]
Forever they will delight to learn more about Jehovah’s beautiful qualities .
No matter how hard we try to do what is right , we make mistakes , sometimes serious ones . ​ — Rom .
First , by performing the miracle of transferring the life of his beloved heavenly Son to the womb of a virgin so that he could be born as a perfect human .
God raised Jesus back to life as a glorious spirit creature . ​ — 1 Pet .
Why was God pleased to reward his Son with heavenly life ?
and are followed by 22 lines , each line beginning with one of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet .
How well this psalm depicts how Christ’s followers on earth today can be happy !
Why do God’s servants need to have a wholesome fear of him , and how should you feel about God’s commandments ?
This wholesome fear of displeasing him helps them to resist the spirit of Satan’s world .
Eventually , those who take “ very much delight ” in God’s commandments will grow to human perfection and enjoy forever “ the glorious freedom of the children of God . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
8 : 21 .
How have true Christians used their spiritual riches , and how will their righteousness stand forever ?
The fact is , in the main , those choosing to humble themselves before God may be poor and looked down upon , as was true in Jesus ’ day .
6 : 20 ; 1 Tim . 6 : 18 , 19 ; read James 2 : 5 .
Anointed Christians , along with their companions , do not keep their spiritual riches to themselves .

Gracious and Just
It is not pleasant to receive help from one who makes you feel inferior or who makes you feel that you are a nuisance or a burden .
Jehovah is the outstanding example of a gracious , happy Giver .
As foretold , the faithful steward class cares for the Master’s interests in harmony with Jehovah’s justice .
This is reflected in the Scriptural guidance given to elders , who sometimes have to handle cases of gross sin in the congregation .
Blessings for the Righteous
15 , 16 . ( a ) What effect does the world’s bad news have on righteous ones ?
He will not be afraid even of bad news . His heart is steadfast , made reliant upon Jehovah .
God’s righteous ones also have to put up with the hatred and lies spread by opposers , but this has failed to silence true Christians and will continue to fail .
Rather , God’s servants continue steadfast and unmovable in the work Jehovah has given them ​ — to preach the good news of the Kingdom and to make disciples of all who respond .
Then , at last , we will ‘ look on our adversaries ’ as they go down in humiliating defeat .
What an experience it will be to see the complete sanctification of Jehovah’s name ! ​ — Ezek .
38 : 18 , 22 , 23 .
Such enjoyment will be the everlasting lot of all who maintain a righteous standing with God .
The desire of the wicked ones will perish . ”
Their desire to see an end to our work will perish with them during the coming “ great tribulation . ” ​ — Matt .
24 : 21 .
Will you be among the happy survivors of that grand victory ?
They will be remembered and loved by Jehovah forever and ever . ​ — Ps .

“ The Angel of Jehovah Is Camping All Around ”
What had he observed that was so dangerous ?
Neither they nor other religious people I questioned were able to give me a satisfying answer .
Encouraged to Study the Bible
Eight months later , I was sent as a special pioneer to Grangemouth , Scotland .
34 : 7 .
With two others , I was assigned to the city of Galway .
He was sent by the priest !
That was after only three weeks in Galway !
Rather than returning home after the assembly , I served in Collingwood , Ontario , Canada , until Gilead School began in 1959 .
“ No , ” he replied .
I arrived back in Ireland in August 1959 and was assigned to the Dun Laoghaire Congregation .
He reasoned that since Ireland at the time was a missionary field , he would pioneer there .
I continued my ministry as best I could .
We could not go to sleep in case our apartment block caught fire .
Another time , a sister and I were out in service and noticed an odd - looking length of pipe on a windowsill .
Local people who came out thought that we had set off the pipe bomb !
When we said , “ Yes , but they just ignored us , ” she was amazed .
Because during the previous days a doctor and a policeman had had their cars hijacked and burned .
Finally , in 1987 , we were assigned to Castlebar , where we are today .
Eric became seriously ill in 1999 .
Eric and I have attended the Pioneer Service School twice .
Though I have had to face bitter religious opposition and have lived through times of serious political and social troubles , one of my greatest challenges was having to give up driving .
Together , Eric and I have served as special pioneers for a total of over 100 years ​ — 98 of them here in Ireland .
We have no thought of retiring .
You Must Not Forget Jehovah
SOME in the group had done something like it before .
3 : 13 - 17 .
So he ordered Israel’s leader , Joshua , to take 12 stones from the river bottom and deposit them at their first encampment .
That monument of stones would remind the nation of Jehovah’s mighty acts and impress on them why they should always serve him loyally .
That links forgetting Jehovah to willful disobedience .
The danger is real in our day too .
Pharaoh’s magic - practicing priests were powerless to stop them .
But Jehovah kept the Egyptians back by placing a pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire between them and the Israelites .
Israel began crossing the sea on dry land .
A more prudent head would have abandoned the chase ​ — but not Pharaoh .
136 : 13 - 15 .
Clearly , Israel had even more reasons to remember him .
‘ Safeguarding Them as the Pupil of His Eye ’
As they trekked across that ‘ thirsty ground with no water ’ ​ — and no food for such a multitude — ​ Jehovah’s hand was not short .
If the Israelites gratefully remembered Jehovah’s saving acts , they would always serve him and strive to obey his laws .
Forgetfulness Breeds Ingratitude
Moses declared : “ The Rock who fathered you , you proceeded to forget , and you began to leave God out of memory . ”
At one point the Israelites reproached Moses because of a supposed lack of water .
They questioned God’s judgment and rejected Moses as leader , saying : “ If only we had died in the land of Egypt , or if only we had died in this wilderness ! . . .
But the two of them stood firm with confidence in Jehovah . ​ — Num .
Yes , the Israelites owed their lives to him .
Actually , we can never repay Jehovah .
10 : 13 .
Today the Christian congregation worships Jehovah “ with spirit and truth . ”
We have good reason to do so , for Jehovah continues to guide and care for us individually in this difficult time of the end .

How Can You Endure in the Ministry ?
How can you persevere in the ministry despite such obstacles ?
1 : 6 ; 20 : 7 - 11 .
He says : “ During my more than 70 years in the ministry , I have sometimes been discouraged by the reactions of people ​ — their hostility or their indifference .
Send me . ”
What enables me to do that is prayer and a consideration of the day’s text before I go out in the field service .
The prophet Ezekiel served among the stubborn Jewish exiles in Babylon .
Henryk tries to have an outlook like that of Ezekiel : “ I want to be clean from the blood of all men .
Krystyna , who admits that she occasionally becomes despondent , says : “ That is why I keep begging Jehovah for strength .
He never lets me down . ”
Henryk observes : “ Engaging in the field service helps me to work on my personality .
What a privilege it is to be able to work with the faithful angels !
How about fellow Kingdom publishers ?
Working together with others in the ministry provides us with a wonderful opportunity to observe effective methods that may be new to us .
Try to share in the ministry with different publishers .
Take Good Care of Yourself
I organize my time carefully so as to have enough time for witnessing . ”
Even if many do not want to talk to us , they may speak about our visit after we have left their door .
“ Sharing in the ministry helps us to put on the new personality and to show love for God and our neighbors , ” notes Zygmunt .
Caring for our spiritual and physical needs helps us endure in the ministry
While those names may sound similar to the names of the Bible books we know as 1 Kings and 2 Kings , the four books were not inspired , nor do those books find a place in the Bible canon .
They were likely just historical writings available back in the period when the prophet Jeremiah and Ezra wrote the accounts that we have in the Bible .
Yes , some Bible writers did refer to or consult existing but uninspired histories or documents .
Similarly , to prepare his Gospel account , Luke “ traced all things from the start with accuracy . ”
He probably meant that he consulted written sources available to him as he compiled the list of Jesus ’ genealogy that we can read in his Gospel .
Because of that , Jehovah did not see to their preservation .
3 : 16 ; 2 Chron .
Yes , what Jehovah chose to include in the 66 Bible books that we have is just what we need to “ be fully competent , completely equipped for every good work . ” ​ — 2 Tim .

Jehovah Deserves Our United Praise
PAGE 20
This two - part series reminds us of why it is vital to keep focused on the prize , or reward , that God holds out to us .
“ The Angel of Jehovah Is Camping All Around ”
PAGE 29
They believe that being born again is a mark of all true Christians and the only way to salvation .
If so , you no doubt want to help your relatives and friends to find that road and to start walking on it .
In fact , a current dictionary defines a born - again individual as “ a usually Christian person who has made a renewed or confirmed commitment of faith especially after an intense religious experience . ” ​ — Merriam - Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary — ​ Eleventh Edition .
Would you be surprised to learn that the Bible does not agree with that definition ?
You will surely benefit from taking a closer look at this subject .
Why ?
▪ What change of relationship does it bring about ?
It is another Biblical term that describes the experience of being “ born again . ”
In answer Jesus said to him : ‘ Most truly I say to you , Unless anyone is born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God . ’
What has been born from the flesh is flesh , and what has been born from the spirit is spirit .
In answer Nicodemus said to him : ‘ How can these things come about ? ’
If I have told you earthly things and yet you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ? ’ ” ​ — John 3 : 1 - 12 .
The words “ unless ” and “ cannot ” highlight the necessity of the new birth .
Clearly , according to Jesus , being born again is a requirement ​ — a must — ​ for one to “ enter into the kingdom of God . ” ​ — John 3 : 5 .
* Thus , according to that alternate rendering , the new birth originates “ from above ” ​ — that is , “ from heaven , ” or “ from the Father . ”
If we keep the expression “ from above ” in mind , it is not hard to understand why an individual cannot cause his own new birth .
Was it up to you to make the choice that led to your birth ?
Of course not !
After all , if Jesus ’ words do indeed constitute a command , he would be ordering us to do something beyond our control .
In other words , when Jesus said you must be “ born again , ” he was stating a fact , not giving a command .
He said : “ It is necessary for you to be born from above . ” ​ — John 3 : 7 , Modern Young’s Literal Translation .
One of them is set aside as a school for students belonging to a native , or indigenous , population living in an area far from that city .
The principal tells him , “ To enroll , you must be a native . ”
Of course , the principal’s words are not a command .
The principal simply states the fact ​ — the requirement for attending that school .
Similarly , when Jesus said : “ You people must be born again , ” he was simply stating a fact ​ — the requirement for one to “ enter into the kingdom of God . ”
[ Picture on page 6 ]
What similarity is there between the new birth and a physical birth ?
The New Birth ​ — What Is Its Purpose ?
Thus , one needs to be born again in order to enter into God’s Kingdom , not in order to receive salvation .
‘ But , ’ some may say , ‘ are not these two expressions ​ — entering the Kingdom and receiving salvation — ​ referring to the same reward ? ’
To understand the difference , let us consider first the meaning of the expression “ kingdom of God . ”
Where is the seat of God’s Kingdom ?
What , then , did Jesus mean when he stated that one must be born again to “ enter into the kingdom of God ” ?
Simply put , the purpose of the new birth is to prepare a limited group of humans for heavenly rulership .
Thus , a person is born again by means of water and spirit .
But to what does the expression “ water and spirit ” refer ?
Consider the events that are recorded immediately before and after the conversation with Nicodemus .
Baptized “ With Holy Spirit ”
“ Suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze , and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting .
The apostle Peter told a crowd : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
“ Those who embraced his word heartily were baptized , and on that day about three thousand souls were added . ” ​ — Acts 2 : 38 , 41 .
Then he received the holy spirit .
WHY did Jesus use the expression “ born . . . from spirit ” when speaking about the baptism with holy spirit ?
Therefore , the figures of speech “ born ” and “ new birth ” highlight that there will be a new beginning in the relationship between God and those who are baptized with holy spirit .
In explaining how God prepares humans for rulership in heaven , the apostle Paul used an illustration taken from family life .
To see how the example of adoption helps one to understand what sort of change takes place when an individual is baptized with holy spirit , consider once more the illustration of the young man who wants to enroll in a school for students who belong to a native population .
The adoption has completely changed his prospects .
The young man in the illustration will be given a place in school but only if he meets the requirement for admission ​ — that of belonging to the native population .
What changed the condition of the young man ?
The legal process of adoption .
Of course , that process did not change the young man’s nature .
Nevertheless , as Paul further explained , after the legal requirements for adoption had been met , they received a new status .
A precious inheritance indeed !
That question will be considered in the following article .
Yes , blessings were to be made available to all nations through Abraham’s “ seed . ”
He told them how he and his wife had saved the baby son of King Ahaziah .
And a plan was made .
Rather than continue keeping company with those who served Jehovah , Jehoash became friends with those who worshipped false gods .
What do you think Zechariah did when he learned about the bad things that Jehoash was now doing ? —

And remember , if we start out doing what is good , as Jehoash did , we need to continue to make friends with those who love Jehovah and who encourage us to serve him .
If you are reading with a child , the dash provides a reminder to pause and encourage the child to express himself .
How was Jehoash saved , and from whom ?
What lessons can we learn from this Bible story ?

Exodus 22 : 22 - 24
Those inspired words convey a touching lesson about Jehovah God ​ — he is sensitive to the needs of disadvantaged ones .
A child who lost his father ​ — and hence his protector and sustainer — ​ was vulnerable .
In other Bible translations , the word “ afflict ” is rendered “ abuse , ” “ mistreat , ” and “ take advantage of . ”
The individual and the nation as a whole were equally responsible for obeying this divine precept .
What , then , would happen if someone were to wrong a fatherless boy , giving that child reason to cry out to God ?
God himself would execute judgment upon anyone who took advantage of a defenseless child . ​ — Deuteronomy 10 : 17 , 18 .
Jehovah has not changed .

11 Rulership for Some , Benefits for Many


Jehovah’s Wisdom Observed in Creation
Some say that a person is wise if he has merely accumulated a wealth of knowledge .
He knows all that there is to know about the universe , including its composition and its history .
“ The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
( Read James 3 : 17 . )
The apostle Paul marveled at Jehovah’s wisdom .
( Read Romans 1 : 20 . )
5 , 6 . ( a ) Besides Jehovah , who was involved in creation ?
( b ) What will we consider , and why ?
That Bible chapter also refers to Jesus as God’s “ master worker . ” ​ — Prov .
8 : 12 , 22 - 31 .
Let us consider four examples of created things that are described at Proverbs 30 : 24 - 28 as “ instinctively wise . ”
*
7 , 8 .
Ants are organized into colonies , and in most colonies three types of ants can be found : queens , males , and workers .
One particular ant , the South American leaf - cutting ant , could be called a sophisticated gardener .
Researchers have found that this skillful “ gardener ” adjusts its efforts according to the amount of food that is needed by the colony .
9 , 10 .
The Bible tells us : “ Go to the ant , you lazy one ; see its ways and become wise . Although it has no commander , officer or ruler , it prepares its food even in the summer ; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest . ”
No matter what our assignment in God’s organization , all of us should have “ plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ”
Describe some characteristics of the rock badger .
*
12 , 13 .
What lessons can we learn from the rock badger ?
One way we can be watchful is by taking advantage of the spiritual protection that Jehovah makes available to us .
Study of God’s Word and attendance at Christian meetings should not be neglected .
We can also learn from the locust .
15 , 16 .
10 : 39 .
“ Cling to What Is Good ”
Why do the feet of a gecko adhere to smooth surfaces ?
The tiny gecko lizard seems to defy gravity .
In fact , scientists are awed by the ability of this little creature to scurry up walls and even across smooth ceilings without falling .
The secret is not in suction cups or in some type of glue .
Each of these protrusions , in turn , has hundreds of filaments with saucer - shaped tips .
The intermolecular force from all these filaments is enough to support more than the gecko’s body weight ​ — even when it is skittering upside down across a glass surface !
*
How can we make sure that we always “ cling to what is good ” ?
The Bible admonishes us : “ Abhor what is wicked , cling to what is good . ”
For instance , association with those who do not adhere to God’s laws ​ — whether at school or at work or through some form of ungodly entertainment — ​ might affect our determination to do what is right .
Do not let that happen to you !
( b ) How can godly wisdom benefit us ?

Who likely wrote the book of Job , and when ?
The book also shows that imperfect humans like Job can remain loyal to Jehovah despite intense testing .
Job is described as a man who “ proved to be blameless and upright , and fearing God and turning aside from bad . ”
What is integrity ?
To provide an answer to Satan’s charge , Jehovah allowed Satan to attack that faithful man .
The inspired record describes Job’s reaction to his misfortune : “ Jehovah himself has given , and Jehovah himself has taken away .
Thereafter , God permitted Satan to strike Job with a painful disease .
In what ways did Job’s wife and his visitors put pressure on Job ?
He even questioned whether those who keep integrity are of any value to God !
How did Jehovah help Job ?
I do repent in dust and ashes . ”
In effect , each servant of God who keeps his integrity despite whatever Satan brings against him demonstrates that in his own personal case , the accusations of that remorseless enemy are false .
Jesus was a perfect man , like our first father , Adam .
Jesus ’ faithfulness to the death conclusively demonstrated that Satan is a liar and that his accusations are false . ​ — Rev .
12 : 10 .
Each servant of Jehovah has what opportunity and responsibility ?
Nevertheless , Satan keeps testing Jehovah’s worshippers .
It also comforts us to know that Jehovah gives us the strength to endure and , as in the case of Job , that He sets limits to the trials we face . ​ — 1 Cor .
What details does the book of Job reveal about Satan ?
Hence , the book of Job identifies Satan as mankind’s merciless enemy .
On the contrary , he demanded that Job be put to another severe test .
Their mind may be poisoned by a critical attitude toward individuals in the congregations , Christian elders , or the Governing Body .
Some apostates oppose the use of the divine name , Jehovah .
Job used and praised the name of Jehovah .
In one of his later proverbial utterances , Job declared : “ Look !
The fear of Jehovah ​ — that is wisdom , and to turn away from bad is understanding . ” ​ — Job 28 : 28 .
Clearly , before the calamities struck , he had already cultivated a close relationship with Jehovah .
( a ) How did Job show his devotion to Jehovah ?
( b ) In what ways do we imitate Job’s fine example ?
What a fine example !
And just as Job’s integrity pleased Jehovah , so the integrity of God’s servants today makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice .
This subject will be considered in the following article .
• Why did Job attract the attention of Satan the Devil ?
[ Picture on page 4 ]
The narrative of Job alerts us to the paramount issue of God’s universal sovereignty
1 , 2 . ( a ) The book of Job describes what challenge made by Satan ?
As a result , Job lost his livestock , his children , and his health .
But when Satan challenged Job’s integrity , he had more in mind than just the man Job .
“ Skin in behalf of skin , and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul , ” claimed Satan .
Who is to blame for present world conditions ?
Our first parents , Adam and Eve , chose independence from their Creator .
And since then , successive generations have acted very unwisely .
What precious knowledge we as Jehovah’s servants have !
Peter compared the Devil to “ a roaring lion , seeking to devour someone . ”
After Job had sanctified his children , “ he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them ; for , said Job , ‘ maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart . ’
Job had no “ valuable things ” with which to honor Jehovah .
Consider the example of Sister Valentina Garnovskaya , one of many Witnesses in Russia who like faithful Job kept their integrity despite severe trials .
As a result , she was arrested and sentenced to eight years in a camp .
After spending several years in one camp , she was moved to another .
What a thrilling moment !
She had been willing to give up everything , including her freedom , in order to maintain her integrity .
At the end of her life , Valentina said : “ I never had my own place to live .
What role does love play in our relationship with Jehovah ?
2 : 8 ; Ps .
97 : 10 .
How does Jehovah view what we do for him ?
In the final chapter of the book of Job , God expressed his anger toward Eliphaz , Bildad , and Zophar because they had not spoken the truth .
May we too act in such a way that Jehovah views us with favor .
How did Jehovah help Job to correct his thinking ?
Nevertheless , Jehovah kindly helped Job by posing a series of questions that directed attention away from Job .
They also enabled Job to see more clearly God’s supremacy and the insignificance of man .
• For what conditions and trials is Satan responsible ?
Thirty years later , that child , now an adult , began a ministry that lasted just three and a half years and yet changed history .
The noted 19th - century historian Philip Schaff was moved to state of this young man : “ Without writing a single line , he set more pens in motion , and furnished themes for more sermons , orations , discussions , learned volumes , works of art , and songs of praise , than the whole army of great men of ancient and modern times . ”
Still , the historic events reported by John in his Gospel are of immense value .
4 , 5 .
John and the other three Gospel writers point to Moses , David , and Solomon as men who foreshadowed Jesus as God’s Anointed One and designated King .
While still faithful , Solomon was a wise ruler , and under his kingship Israel enjoyed peace .
Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah’s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ .
With keen anticipation , they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses .
( a ) What miracles did Moses and Jesus perform ?
( b ) Give other similarities between Jesus and Moses .
Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles , thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah’s backing .
And on one occasion , he even walked on water !
Among other things , his prophesying could include announcing future events , revealing aspects of Jehovah’s purpose , or proclaiming God’s judgments .
For example , he spoke about his own death , foretelling how he would die , where he would die , and at whose hands he would die .
24 : 3 - 41 .
As a teacher , he had no equal .
Do you have a meaningful share in that work ?
How was Moses a mediator between the Israelites and God ?
A mediator acts as a bridge between two parties . Moses mediated the Law covenant between Jehovah and the Israelites .
Members of that spiritual nation are the participants in that new covenant .
Esteem Christ as Deliverer
Later , the whole nation was in serious danger .
7 : 10 .
19 , 20 . ( a ) How does meditating on Jesus ’ role as the Greater Moses affect us ?
• a mediator ?
3 : 13 - 16 ; John 5 : 43 ; 17 : 4 , 6 , 26 .
11 : 28 - 30 .
4 : 4 ; John 5 : 22 , 23 ; 15 : 10 .
3 : 2 - 6 .
11 : 24 - 29 ; 12 : 1 ; Rev .
□ After the death of Moses and the man Jesus , God disposed of their bodies . ​ — Deut .
12 : 42 .
HE DID not look like a king .
Young David was not the first son that his father , Jesse , presented to Samuel to be anointed ; neither was he the second or third .
( Read 1 Samuel 16 : 7 . )
Yet , like David , he was Jehovah’s choice .
He was courageous when the flock was threatened and risked his life to protect the sheep from a lion and a bear . ​ — 1 Sam .
( b ) How did Jesus prove to be the Fine Shepherd ?
He loves his sheep so much that while on earth he willingly gave of himself for their well - being .
As king , David was a resolute warrior who protected the land of God’s people , and “ Jehovah kept saving David wherever he went . ”
Explain how Jesus as King - Designate was a conqueror .
Like King David , the man Jesus was fearless .
What is Jesus ’ role as Warrior - King in the heavens ?
Some 60 years after Jesus ’ death and resurrection to heaven , the apostle John received a prophetic vision of Jesus in His role as Warrior - King in the heavens .
After that , “ he went forth conquering . ”
His victorious ride will continue until he will “ complete his conquest , ” completely destroying Satan’s wicked system . ​ — Read Revelation 19 : 11 , 19 - 21 .
Furthermore , under the rule of Jesus and his joint heirs , the resurrected 144,000 , there will be “ a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous . ”
Those who are resurrected on earth will have the prospect of living forever .
What a wonderful future awaits them !
May we all be determined to continue to “ do what is good , ” so that we will be alive when the earth is filled with righteous , happy subjects of the Greater David . ​ — Ps .
Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom Is Answered
* When Solomon became king , Jehovah appeared to him in a dream and said that He would give him anything he asked for .
Instead , he unselfishly asked Jehovah : “ Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out before this people and that I may come in , for who could judge this great people of yours ? ”
Jehovah answered Solomon’s prayer . ​ — Read 2 Chronicles 1 : 11 , 12 .
The queen of Sheba traveled some 1,500 miles [ 2,400 km ] to test Solomon’s wisdom with “ perplexing questions . ”
She was impressed by what Solomon said and by the prosperity of his kingdom .
Follow the Wise King
Therefore , we do well to attend congregation meetings , where we are ‘ taught continually . ’
What similarity is there between Solomon and Jesus ?
65 : 21 , 22 .
Follow the King of Peace
The name Solomon comes from a root meaning “ peace . ”
King Solomon ruled from Jerusalem , the name of which means “ Possession of Twofold Peace . ”
Still , Solomon , in all his wisdom , could not free his subjects from the shackles of sickness , sin , and death .
Indeed , we are enjoying a true spiritual paradise .
However , the future will be even better .
All thanks to Jehovah for providing us with his only - begotten Son ​ — the Greater Moses , David , and Solomon !
Interestingly , a second name for Solomon was Jedidiah , which means “ Beloved of Jah . ” ​ — 2 Sam .
For those who have never suffered the loss of an unborn baby in this way , it may be difficult to imagine the feelings of those who have .
Yet , she remembered each loss .
Do such Christians have a basis for hoping in a resurrection to restore what they have lost ?
Let us consider two related questions .
First , from Jehovah’s viewpoint , when does the life of a human begin ​ — at conception or at birth ?
Second , how does Jehovah view the unborn ​ — as unique individuals or as mere collections of cells and tissue in a woman’s womb ?
The law cited above demanded that an adult be put to death for causing the death of an unborn child .
Further , numerous passages in the Scriptures reveal that Jehovah sees the unborn as distinct individuals .
For example , King David was inspired to say of Jehovah : “ You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother . . . .
139 : 13 - 16 ; Job 31 : 14 , 15 .
Jehovah also sees that the unborn have distinct traits and may have great potential for the future .
While Isaac’s wife Rebekah was pregnant with twins , Jehovah uttered a prophecy about the two boys struggling in her womb , suggesting that he already saw traits in them that would have far - reaching effects . ​ — Gen .
9 : 10 - 13 .
Consider this example : One mother gives birth prematurely to a living baby , who dies after a few days .
To summarize , then , the Bible clearly teaches that life begins at conception and that Jehovah sees the unborn child as a unique and valued individual .
However , further study and prayerful meditation has led the Governing Body to conclude that such considerations do not really have a bearing on the resurrection hope .
Really , though , it seems best to avoid speculation .
However , the original Hebrew text shows that the law spoke of a fatal injury to either the mother or her unborn child .
Jehovah will provide healing for all painful experiences
Can You Serve Where the Need for Kingdom Publishers Is Greater ?
My wife and I had formerly served as missionaries , and we wanted to enjoy that simple but happy kind of life again . ”
The branch office in Mexico responded that there was an urgent need for Kingdom publishers who could preach to the English - speaking population in that country .
English - speaking people there will not be interested in the truth ! ’
There , the brothers showed them a map of the entire country and told the new arrivals , “ This is your territory ! ”
Soon more brothers and sisters who wanted to expand their ministry arrived .
They were thinking of learning Spanish , but their plans changed after they moved to the town of Ajijic on the shores of Lake Chapala , which is a haven for retirees from the United States .
In the beginning , it was a challenge for their daughter Britanny to be part of a small English - language congregation with few other young people .
“ After visiting Monterrey , a town in northeastern Mexico , we felt that Jehovah was directing us to help there , ” says Patrick .
In the past , they were accustomed to attend assemblies in air - conditioned comfort close to home .
Rubén relates : “ We had the joy of witnessing to foreigners who have lived for years in Mexico but who heard the message of the good news in their own language for the first time .
Reaching Those Who Are Hard to Reach
In addition to foreigners , there are many Mexicans who speak English .
Yet , when such householders are approached by Witnesses from abroad , some react favorably .
Consider the example of Gloria in the city of Querétaro , in central Mexico .
She explains : “ I had been contacted before by Spanish - speaking Witnesses but did not listen to them .
However , when my family and friends started to have problems , I became depressed and turned to God in prayer , begging him to show me a way out .
Gloria accepted a Bible study and progressed very quickly to baptism , in spite of family opposition .
Still others accepted the offer to study the Bible because they had retired and had time to pursue spiritual interests .
No doubt more people around the world will respond favorably as they hear the Kingdom message preached to them in their own language .
It is therefore heartwarming to note that numerous spiritually - minded brothers and sisters ​ — young and old , single and married — ​ are willing to move to areas where the need for Kingdom proclaimers is great .
True , they may cope with hardships , but these fade away in comparison with the happiness they feel as they find honesthearted individuals who embrace Bible truths .
For more information on serving where the need is greater , see Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , pages 111 - 112 .
Beryl emigrated from Britain to Canada .
There she worked as a manager for several international companies .
She also became an accomplished equestrienne and was even chosen to represent Canada in the 1980 Olympics .
For several years , Beryl was able to serve as a regular pioneer .
“ It Is a Blessing to Have Them With Us ”
God’s Word states that “ the women telling the good news are a large army . ”
“ The challenges are many , ” says Angelica , a sister in her mid - 30 ’ s who served several years abroad as a single pioneer .
They often tell me that my example of coping with problems while serving for many years as a single pioneer helps them to see that they too can overcome challenges in their life .

They also explain how we , like Job , can remain faithful and thus make Jehovah’s heart rejoice .
In this article , we will consider four examples of Jehovah’s creation and discuss what lessons they contain .
Study Articles 4 , 5 PAGES 24 - 32
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower ?
Keeping our integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty out of love and to prove that Satan is a liar .
We can prepare our heart , focusing on how much we can help others .
We can preach with a view to starting Bible studies .
The Bible also speaks of leprosy that appeared in garments and houses .
• How should Bible teachings affect a Christian’s attitude and practices regarding funerals ?
To avoid problems , some Christians put in writing their instructions as to funeral arrangements . ​ — 2 / 15 , pages 29 - 31 .
The verse mentions “ the counsel of the wicked ones , ” “ the way of sinners , ” and “ the seat of ridiculers . ”

The first edition contained the divine name , Iahveh , in some places .
Keys to Family Happiness
‘ Do we really have to talk about the Bible ? ’ they ask .
Now as a teenager , he is tugging at the rope , eager to set sail , and you get the impression that you are not invited on board .
From birth onward , a child’s life is a list of firsts ​ — the first steps taken , the first word spoken , the first day of school , to name just a few .
The accomplishment provides evidence of something that they yearn to see ​ — growth .
Still , adolescence is a vital phase of growth .
In essence , that is what your son or daughter is doing during the teen years ​ — shedding the traits of childhood and learning to become a responsible young adult who is self - reliant and mature enough to leave home .
“ If my son is not responsible enough to keep his room clean , how will he maintain an apartment ? ”
Philippians 4 : 5 : “ Let your reasonableness become known . ”
To keep him in line , they all but lock him in the house .
Really , if your teen never learns to make decisions for himself while at home , how will he know how to make them after he leaves ?
TRY THIS : The next time you talk to your teen about an issue , help him to reason on how his choices reflect on him .
For example , instead of criticizing his friends , say : “ What if [ name ] got arrested for breaking the law ?
Rarely , though , is the takeoff that smooth .
Bible principles are a solid foundation upon which you can build family happiness .
While we will refer to the child as a male , the principles discussed apply to both genders .
By the time he or she leaves home , will my adolescent be able to do the following ?
So that was the system he had in mind when he said : “ The end will come . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 .
Jesus said : “ This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations ; and then the end will come . ”
For as they were in those days before the flood , . . . they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away . ”
Jesus said : “ Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with . . . anxieties of life , and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare . For it will come . ”
Draw Close to God
Imagine that you could ask God about himself and then listen as he described his own attributes .
* Moses did not describe in detail what he saw in the magnificent vision .
Next , Jehovah says that he is “ slow to anger . ”
He is not prone to become angry with his earthly servants .
Sooner or later the consequences of their sinful behavior will catch up with them .
Are you not moved to learn more about his beautiful qualities ?
Protect Yourself Against Wicked Spirits
“ I would never have considered appealing to the spirits to bring harm to others , ” he says , “ but I did not think it was possible to have a happy life without using rarafono [ traditional practices that call for help from the spirits ] for protection from harm . ”
And when James was at work , he would collect any scraps left over from his lunch and keep them in a bag to be disposed of later .
You may believe that adhering to such customs is essential to your welfare .
If you respect the Bible , you no doubt want to know what it says in answer to the following questions : ( 1 ) What harm can wicked spirits bring upon you ?
The Scriptures plainly state that we need protection from wicked spirits .
The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Ephesus : “ We have a wrestling , not against blood and flesh , but against . . . the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places . ”
Satan causes harm primarily by misleading people , tricking or tempting them into acting in a way that offends God .
What is his goal in misleading people ?
Jesus said : “ Go away , Satan ! For it is written , ‘ It is Jehovah your God you must worship . ’ ”
But if we are going to please Jehovah God as Jesus did , we need to avoid any act of submission to Satan or his demons .
Jehovah God warned his ancient people , the Israelites , against copying some of the traditional practices of nearby nations .
Therefore , when considering customs prevalent in your area , consider the following questions : Does the custom encourage a belief in omens ?
However , Jehovah held Eve accountable for her actions .
He also holds us accountable for our conduct . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 13 .
True , abandoning traditional practices may not be easy to do .
James , mentioned earlier , faced this challenge .
“ All that has happened is that I have learned to trust in Jehovah .
This custom is not the same as when a girl is unknowingly drugged and then forced to have sex against her will .
A girl collects food scraps so that they cannot be used to cast a spell
in Jesus ’ voice ?

( b ) In contrast , what does each of Jesus ’ responses reveal ? ․ ․ ․ ․ ․
When temptation is likely to strike .
WHAT ASPECT OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MOST MEANINGFUL TO YOU , AND WHY ?
WHEN Jesus was on earth , his disciples approached him and asked : “ What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things ? ”
The initial fulfillment of the prophecy that Jesus gave them in answer to their question took place in the first century .
In 66 C.E . , Cestius Gallus led Roman troops in a nearly successful attack on Jerusalem .
Those Christians needed keen discernment and spiritual perception to recognize the turn of events and flee .
6 : 1 .
We are living during the time of the final fulfillment of Jesus ’ prophecy .
What Christian Maturity Is
Reading the Bible daily has sustained me through some of the darkest moments of my life . ”
What power can the Word of God exert on us ?
Such reading can mold our inner person and make us more pleasing to Jehovah .
Do you have a personal need to schedule more time to read the Bible and meditate on what it says ?
She explains : “ The scripture that readily came to my mind was Romans 12 : 18 , which says : ‘ As far as it depends upon you , be peaceable with all men . ’
For example , shortly after Jehovah liberated the sons of Israel from Egyptian bondage , they “ fell to quarreling with Moses ” and kept “ putting Jehovah to the test . ”
Was this because the prolonged absence of Moses while he was being instructed on Mount Horeb made them fearful ?
Paul urged Christians to ‘ do their utmost ’ to avoid ‘ falling into the same pattern of disobedience ’ that the Israelites showed when they were afraid to enter the Promised Land . ​ — Heb .
How did Jesus learn obedience , and with what benefit ?
Pressing on to maturity requires that we do our utmost to obey Jehovah .
What about us ?
Are we obedient to Jehovah in these matters even under adversity ?
Our obedience is an indication that we have progressed toward maturity .
Christian Maturity ​ — Why Beneficial ?
For example , a brother named James , who regularly read and deeply appreciated Scriptural publications , accepted a job where all his coworkers were women .
I thought it was a joke but found it very hard to stop her .
The article used the example of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife .
* I promptly pushed the girl away , and she ran out . ”
1 : 5 .
Maturity is also beneficial in that it strengthens our figurative heart and keeps us from being “ carried away with various and strange teachings . ”
By putting forth such effort , Louise developed ‘ firmness of heart , ’ and it proved to be vital when she faced a distressing health problem .
Why was obedience especially vital in the first century ?
Those who heeded it had the keen spiritual discernment needed to recognize the signal Jesus had given for them to “ begin fleeing to the mountains . ”
Heeding Jesus ’ prophetic warning , Christians fled the city of Jerusalem prior to its destruction and , according to ecclesiastical historian Eusebius , settled in the city of Pella in the mountainous region of Gilead .
They thereby avoided the worst disaster for Jerusalem in recorded history .
( b ) What will be considered in the next article ?
• What is spiritual maturity , and how do we attain it ?
[ Picture on page 12 , 13 ]
“ Ponder over these things ; be absorbed in them , that your advancement may be manifest to all persons . ” ​ — 1 TIM .
4 : 15 .
What does God desire for young people ?
More than that , Jehovah wants your joy to last beyond the time of youth .
Good judgment needs to be exercised by young people .
Consider the advice the apostle Paul gave to the Corinthians .
What does making spiritual advancement involve ?
He was to strive to make his manner of life exemplary .
Timothy thus needed to continue to make spiritual advancement .
He was not just beginning to make spiritual advancement .
How can adversity affect young people ?
A 17 - year - old Christian named Carol said , “ At times , I have been emotionally , physically , and mentally drained to the point that I didn’t want to wake up in the morning . ”
It includes the ability to face things as they are ​ — not the way you would like them to be .
Christians are admonished “ to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things . ” ​ — Titus 2 : 12 .
10 , 11 .
( Read 1 Peter 4 : 7 . )
He will “ really help you . ” ​ — Isa .
Some in Bible times rashly made a sacred , or holy , vow without carefully analyzing what was involved .
So before pursuing a courtship , ask yourself : ‘ Why do I want to get married ?
Is this the right person for me ?
To help you make an insightful examination , “ the faithful and discreet slave ” has published very specific articles .
Carefully evaluate what is stated there and apply it .
Become full - grown in your understanding of the demands of marriage .
Spiritual maturity also brings success after marriage .
As our Exemplar , “ the Christ did not please himself . ”
A husband will show self - sacrificing love , and a wife will be determined to be in submission to her husband as Jesus is to his Head . ​ — 1 Cor .
Drawing attention to Timothy’s important assignment , Paul wrote : “ I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus , . . . preach the word , be at it urgently . ”
He added : “ Do the work of an evangelizer , fully accomplish your ministry . ”
Paul wrote : “ Continue applying yourself to public reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
How are your study habits ?
Pondering over what you study will move your heart . ​ — Read Proverbs 2 : 1 - 5 .
As a result of this , I am always growing spiritually . ”
Serving as a pioneer will indeed help you to improve your ability to use the Bible in the ministry and to make spiritual advancement .
Strive to be a good reader and to give meaningful comments at Christian meetings .
As a spiritually mature youth , you would want to prepare instructive student talks in the Theocratic Ministry School , adhering to the assigned material .
Advancement Brings Real Satisfaction

The Angels ​ — “ Spirits for Public Service ”
“ Are they not all spirits for public service , sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation ? ” ​ — HEB .
JESUS CHRIST warned any who might stumble his followers : “ See to it that you men do not despise one of these little ones ; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven . ”
What can we learn from their examples ?
2 , 3 .
Under the archangel are the seraphs , who declare Jehovah’s holiness and help to keep his people clean spiritually .
There are also the cherubs , who serve as upholders of his majesty .
Other angels , or messengers , have various duties in carrying out God’s will . ​ — Heb .
12 : 22 , 23 .
Surely the holy angels must have been appalled when they witnessed the beginning of revolt in God’s household .
With the first recorded lie , Satan slyly induced the first human pair to join him in rebelling against their loving Creator . ​ — Gen .
3 : 4 , 5 ; John 8 : 44 .
This prophecy provided a sure basis for hope , although the details remained a “ sacred secret ” to be revealed progressively .
What did some angels do in Noah’s day , and with what consequence for them ?
Abraham , Jacob , Moses , Joshua , Isaiah , Daniel , Jesus , Peter , John , and Paul are among those who were ministered to by angels .
However , God knows the point beyond which a test would prove nothing more as far as our integrity to him is concerned .
Angels are ever alert to intervene according to God’s will .
The circumstances and issues were different .
The Scriptures do not teach that each person on earth has a guardian angel .
We pray in confidence that “ no matter what it is that we ask according to his will , [ God ] hears us . ”
How were angels used to help Jesus , and what did he accomplish by remaining faithful to God ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 9 - 11 . )
Let us also keep free from improper judging , respect those entrusted with oversight in the congregation , and leave matters in the hands of Jehovah , the Supreme Judge . ​ — Rom .
13 : 17 .
Although there are millions of spirit creatures in heaven , the Bible reveals the names of only Michael and Gabriel .
How can our conduct affect the angels ?
Yes , angels are pleased to see Christian women and all other earthly servants of God comply with theocratic order and headship .
19 , 20 .
How are the angels involved in what is just ahead , and how should we feel about their role ?
Grand deliverance from Satan’s wicked system of things is just ahead .
Angels will have a definite role in these significant events that will vindicate Jehovah’s sovereignty and bring to complete fulfillment his purpose for the earth and mankind .
Jehovah has also revealed details about himself in his written Word , the Bible .
77 : 12 .
What will help us to imitate Jehovah more fully , and why ?
He said : “ Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart . ”
What do we learn about Jehovah from Jesus ’ example ?
Do not the miracles Christ performed show the tremendous power he had at his disposal ?
His teachings and the winsome words he used to reach people’s hearts indicate that he was “ more than Solomon ” in wisdom .
The Son of God represented Jehovah so perfectly in everything he said and did that he could say : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father also . ”
At that time , Jehovah himself made known that Jesus was his Anointed One , saying : “ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . ”
( b ) Why should we not fail to follow Jesus Christ ?
In the Bible , the title “ Christ ” is used with reference to Jesus in various ways , such as Jesus Christ , Christ Jesus , and the Christ .
Jesus himself first used the term “ Jesus Christ ” ​ — the name followed by the title .
This usage clearly draws attention to the one who was sent forth by God and became his Anointed One .
When the title is placed ahead of the name , as in “ Christ Jesus , ” the emphasis shifts from the person to the position , or office , held by him .
Regardless of how the title “ Christ ” is used with reference to Jesus , it highlights this important truth : Even though the Son of God came to the earth as a man and made his Father’s will known , he was neither just an ordinary man nor merely a prophet ; he came to be the Anointed One of Jehovah .
What statement made to the apostle Thomas holds meaning for us ?
Another vital reason to keep on following the Messiah is stated in Jesus ’ words to his faithful apostles , spoken just a few hours before his death .
That is , he is the only one through whom it is possible for us to approach God .
As a result , the Bible explains : “ The blood of Jesus . . . cleanses us from all sin . ”
How is Jesus “ the truth ” ?
Jesus is “ the life ” because he has bought the human race with his lifeblood , and everlasting life is a gift that God gives “ by Christ Jesus our Lord . ”
What reason do we have for following Jesus ?
At that time , they heard a voice from heaven say : “ This is my Son , the one that has been chosen .
Listen to him . ”
As his sheep , let us be eager to listen to Jesus and follow him . ​ — John 10 : 27 .
[ Picture on page 30 ]
When vital Bible truths are being conveyed from the platform , would it not show disrespect for God’s Word and his organization if we unnecessarily conversed with one another ?
Even in private one - on - one conversations , being a good listener is a mark of respect .

Job was willing to listen silently when they spoke .
Under such circumstances , our words may appear foolish , and our peace of mind may suffer as a result .
Concerning one of his contemporaries , the 19th - century English writer Sydney Smith wrote : “ He has occasional flashes of silence , that make his conversation perfectly delightful . ”
A good conversationalist must be a good listener .
Hence , the fewer the words spoken , the less the chance of committing an indiscretion .
An Aid to Meditation
14 : 23 ; Luke 4 : 42 ; 5 : 16 .
By all means , let us be among those who are zealously declaring the Kingdom good news and speaking about the wonderful works of God .
As we share in this important activity , may our lifestyle also reflect an awareness that silence , at times , is golden .
Silence may be the proper response to verbal abuse in our ministry
When Location Was Important
No other place on earth could offer security . ​ — Gen .
7 : 19 , 20 .
Two angels informed him of where he was not to be .
Noah had to go into the ark ; Lot had to get out of Sodom .
Can Jehovah save the righteous wherever they are , without their having to relocate ?
That very night , “ Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison hole , and every firstborn of beast . ”
The Israelites were about to begin their conquest of the Promised Land .
“ It came about that as soon as the people [ of Israel ] heard the sound of the horn and the people began to shout a great war cry , ” states Joshua 6 : 20 , “ then the wall began to fall down flat . ”
Are we doing all that God has commanded us ?
Or are we so desensitized that it does not bother us ?
Imagine how each Israelite family must have fixed their eyes on their firstborn as “ there began arising a great outcry ” in one Egyptian household after another .
Soon the end will come for Satan’s wicked world .
It is vital that we develop and maintain a wholesome attitude toward the congregation and be firmly resolved to stay in close association with it .
We can take to heart Paul’s exhortation : “ Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works , not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together , as some have the custom , but encouraging one another , and all the more so as [ we ] behold the day drawing near . ” ​ — Heb .
[ Footnotes ]
By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ”
“ Husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies , ” states the Bible .
“ He who loves his wife loves himself , for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but he feeds and cherishes it , as the Christ also does the congregation . ”
On the other hand , a woman having all the comforts of a fine home can be desperately unhappy if she is being neglected or ignored by her marriage partner .
If you are a Christian husband , remember that your wife is also your Christian sister .
She is your sister too , not only at the Kingdom Hall but also at home .
He told them : “ I no longer call you slaves , because a slave does not know what his master does . But I have called you friends , because all the things I have heard from my Father I have made known to you . ”
Christian husbands , imitate Christ’s love .
‘ Continue loving your wife ’
Imitate the Loyalty of Ittai
“ GREAT and wonderful are your works , Jehovah God , the Almighty .
Righteous and true are your ways , King of eternity .
Indeed , we are assured : “ Jehovah is a lover of justice , and he will not leave his loyal ones . ”
Without introduction , the seasoned warrior Ittai steps into the Bible record at the time of Absalom’s rebellion against King David .
Ittai and 600 Philistine men who had followed him were then living in exile in the vicinity of Jerusalem .
Moreover , there are all the Gittites ​ — Ittai and his 600 warriors . ​ — 2 Sam .
15 : 19 , 20 .
Even though he was a foreigner and an exile from Philistia , Ittai recognized Jehovah as the living God and David as Jehovah’s anointed one .
He viewed David as more than someone who had killed the Philistine champion Goliath and many more of Ittai’s countrymen .
Why , David even placed one third of his forces “ under the hand of Ittai ” in the climactic battle against Absalom’s forces ! ​ — 2 Sam .
18 : 25 .
We know neither his name nor that of his mother , but we know what he did .
It is apparently the year 56 C.E .
Paul has been arrested and is to be tried .
Somehow , Paul’s nephew learns about the plan .
Hence , he appeals to have a trial in Rome , and he is sent there . ​ — Acts 23 : 16 – 24 : 27 ; 25 : 8 - 12 .
What can we learn from this account about Paul’s nephew ? — That it takes courage to speak up for the right things and that if we do , we can save lives .
Stay by these things , for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you . ”
For example , at one time Jehovah God gave Christians the power to perform miracles , but now he does not .
Under the Mosaic Law , Jehovah required Sabbath - keeping , but now he does not .
God also changes his instructions to his people according to their situation and needs .
He would tell his group to take a different road , away from the danger .
That , however , does not mean that he has changed his mind about the destination , does it ?
You may be aware that when Israel was God’s chosen nation , God often demonstrated by miracles that he was with them .
Miracles they performed helped to establish Christianity in many lands .
Why , then , did miracles cease ?
Marriage was to be a lasting bond between two persons .
Why Was Sabbath - Keeping Temporary ?
Rather , he responded to the needs of his people under varying circumstances , and he did so for their benefit .
I have formed it , I shall also do it . ” ​ — Isaiah 46 : 10 , 11 .
God never changes his standards of love and justice
[ Blurb on page 22 ]
So said one woman about her efforts to please God .
In the cases mentioned in this passage , the individual had sinned unintentionally or thoughtlessly .
But what if he was poor and did not have a lamb or a goat to offer ?
Did he have to work until he could afford one , thereby delaying atonement for his sins ?
The phrase “ if . . . he cannot afford ” may also be rendered “ if . . . his hand cannot reach . ”
He is a compassionate , understanding God who takes into account the limitations of his worshippers .
Does that mean that the flour offerings of the poor were worthless ?
PICTURE the scene .
Now he makes his way up to Jerusalem .
Brandishing a whip made of ropes , he drives out all the animals , and the merchants certainly follow them .
He orders those selling doves to take what they have and leave . ​ — John 2 : 13 - 16 .
It was Jesus ’ concern , his zeal , for God’s house that moved him to act .
Then we will consider Bible examples of faithful men who manifested zeal for it .
Their examples were written “ for our instruction ” and can spur us on to even greater zeal . ​ — Rom .
He declared : “ The heavens are my throne , and the earth is my footstool .
What is the modern - day arrangement foreshadowed by worship at Solomon’s temple ?
After the division of Israel back in 997 B.C.E . , 4 out of the 19 kings who ruled Judah , the southern part , demonstrated outstanding zeal for true worship .
( b ) What warning lesson can we learn from the example of King Asa ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 1 - 8 . )
How do we react when Jehovah offers us advice or direction through Christian elders ?
Do we promptly take to heart their Scripturally based counsel and avoid falling into the trap of resentment ?
( a ) How did Jehoshaphat and Judah receive direction ?
5 : 12 , 13 .
Even if we are isolated , our petitions to Jehovah unite us with “ the entire association of [ our ] brothers in the world . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
We likewise respect Jehovah’s direction given through his channel and join in praising him .
The local brothers responded kindly .
16 , 17 .
Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem invited the whole nation ​ — even those of the northern kingdom — ​ to attend .
Why , last year , some seven million of us distributed invitations , and a total of 17,790,631 people attended !
It was said of Hezekiah : “ In Jehovah the God of Israel he trusted ; and after him there proved to be no one like him among all the kings of Judah , even those who had happened to be prior to him . And he kept sticking to Jehovah .
He did not turn aside from following him , but he continued keeping his commandments that Jehovah had commanded Moses . ”
( a ) What happened during King Josiah’s reign , and how did he react ?
What was the effect ?
( b ) What will we consider in the next article ?
[ Pictures on page 9 ]
Jesus ’ zeal was thus significantly evident in his public ministry .
Zeal for Preaching and Teaching
*
Why can our ministry be compared with the campaigns of faithful kings of Judah ?
Today , we similarly engage in a campaign to help people break free from false religious teachings , including the practice of idolatry .
Interestingly , in the third year of his reign , Jehoshaphat sent for five princes , nine Levites , and two priests .
He had them travel through all the cities to teach the people Jehovah’s laws .
So effective was their campaign that the people of the surrounding nations began to fear Jehovah .
Can you do so ?
He recently met an African couple in the street and greeted them in their native tongue , Yoruba .
The householder lamented : “ I don’t know what I have done that God allowed this to happen to me . ”
That conversation led to a regular home Bible study with the woman .
Returning to the example of Josiah , we note that he pursued true worship as a youth and was about 20 years of age when he embarked on his extensive campaign against idolatry .
Could you too learn a foreign language and help other people learn about Jehovah ?
Then she adds : “ After watching that drama , I now realize that I have simply cruised along for many years .
What has she experienced as a result ?
As a result , I am enjoying the ministry so much and find real satisfaction as I see Jehovah’s words comforting others . ”
Many years before Isaiah wrote those words , good King Asa vigorously pursued a campaign to root out immorality in Judah .
( Read 1 Kings 15 : 11 - 13 . )
We need to abhor pornography in order to “ break free from its powerful , magnetic pull , ” as one Christian expressed it .
One brother made strenuous efforts to break his habit of visiting pornographic sites on the Internet .
One visitor to London Bethel changed his whole outlook on Jehovah’s Witnesses after he spent a day servicing a printing machine there .
Everyone was patient , and the atmosphere was peaceful .
How can we be “ zealous for fine works ” ?
From both Bible and modern - day examples , what did you learn about
• how to break free from corrupting habits ?
Do you regularly use the Bible in your ministry ?
Speak Truth With Your Neighbor
“ Now that you have put away falsehood , speak truth each one of you with his neighbor . ” ​ — EPH .
That implied that truth is revealed only after a person has overindulged in wine and perhaps is more eager to talk .
Conflicting attitudes about truth abound in our day .
He always spoke the truth .
Even his enemies acknowledged : “ Teacher , we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth . ”
Who Is Our Neighbor ?
Unlike first - century Jewish leaders , how did Jesus reflect Jehovah’s view of who our neighbor is ?
They “ abhor what is wicked ” and “ cling to what is good . ”
6 , 7 . ( a ) Does being truthful mean that we must disclose even personal details to every inquirer ?
Paul likewise indicated that some people may not be entitled to receive a full or complete answer .
Yes , those who pry into the affairs of others or those who cannot be trusted to keep a confidence may find that others are reluctant to share personal information with them .
5 : 2 .
How does speaking truth help family members to draw close to one another ?
Speak Truth in Congregation Matters
Love for our brothers should move us to do what in the way we use our tongue ?
Love for our brothers will move us to “ safeguard [ our ] tongue against what is bad , and [ our ] lips against speaking deception . ”
Explain .
Or would firm , loving admonition from the Scriptures suffice ?
( Read Proverbs 6 : 16 - 19 . )
Over the years , Roberto found employment for 23 baptized brothers and 8 Bible students !
How should a Christian businessman demonstrate that he speaks truth ?
What do Christians render to ( a ) governmental authorities ?
When Jesus uttered those words , the discussion centered on taxes .
Many countries offer social programs or services to help those in need of material support .
18 - 20 .
What blessings result from being truthful with our neighbor ?
Having a clean conscience is of great value in the eyes of God .
Also , when we are truthful in all things , we do not need to worry about being found out , or exposed , by humans . ​ — 1 Tim .
5 : 24 .
This certainly proved to be the case with a Witness living in Britain .
The man had taken note of the brother’s honesty as well as his neat appearance .
The ensuing discussion led to a fine witness being given .
Paul said : “ We have renounced the underhanded things of which to be ashamed , not walking with cunning . ”
In so doing , we will bring glory to our heavenly Father and to his people .
The Faithful Steward and Its Governing Body
“ Who really is the faithful steward , the discreet one , whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time ? ” ​ — LUKE 12 : 42 .
Yet , the steward is also a servant .
So as this journal has often explained , the steward must represent the “ little flock ” of anointed disciples as a collective body , or group .
In the context of Luke’s Gospel , Jesus had just referred to these ones .
According to Jesus , what major change was to occur ?
Nevertheless , when it comes to spiritual instruction , the work of the slave in Jesus ’ illustration does follow a pattern similar to that of God’s “ servant ” in ancient Israel .
Thereafter , all spirit - anointed Christians became part of the nation that now served as the slave class appointed by the Master , Jesus Christ .
When Jesus appointed his 12 apostles , their primary work involved being sent out to preach the good news to others .
However , as time went on and the Christian congregation was about to be established , the role of an apostle became an “ office of oversight . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 20 - 26 .
( b ) Who else were given extra responsibilities , as confirmed by the governing body ?
They also became known as apostles , although they were not included in the original 12 .
He wrote his first inspired letter .
Not all perform powerful works , do they ? ”
Although all spirit - begotten Christians engaged in the preaching work , only a very limited number ​ — just eight different men — ​ were used to write the 27 books of the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Over what “ belongings ” was the slave appointed ?
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again , but you received a spirit of adoption as sons , by which spirit we cry out : ‘ Abba , Father ! ’
Simply stated , these individuals are anointed by God’s holy spirit and receive a heavenly “ calling , ” or “ invitation . ”
To illustrate : The Scriptures at times speak of “ the congregation ” as taking certain action in handling judicial matters .
Similarly , today a limited number of anointed men have the responsibility of representing the slave class .
( Read Acts 16 : 4 , 5 . )
As part of the King’s belongings , they are happy to cooperate fully with the arrangements made by the Governing Body , which represents “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
No Christian who genuinely receives the anointing with God’s spirit would want or expect such treatment . ​ — Acts 10 : 25 , 26 ; 14 : 14 , 15 .
• How does a person know that he or she has the heavenly calling ?
• How should one of the anointed view himself ?
[ Picture on page 23 ]
There was a similar arrangement in the first century
In 1921 , Mother , a devout Catholic , married Father , a Protestant .
He wrote to the publishers , who put him in contact with the Bibelforscher , as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known in Germany .
“ Do whatever you want , ” she would exclaim in her colorful German , “ but don’t go with those Bibelforscher ! ”
However , Father had made up his mind , and in 1927 he was baptized as one of them .
One day at Mass , the priest warned his parishioners to “ keep away from the false prophet Danner . ”
The heavy missile struck him on the shoulder , just missing his head .
My parents did their utmost to make Jehovah real to my sister and me .
If you are afraid of trials at school , use 1 Corinthians 10 : 13 .
If you are separated from us , recite Proverbs 18 : 10 . ”
I learned Psalms 23 and 91 by heart and came to trust that Jehovah would always protect me .
In 1940 , Nazi Germany annexed Alsace - Lorraine , and the new regime required all adults to join the Nazi party .
Rather than telling me not to salute Hitler , my parents helped me train my conscience .
The teachers slapped me and threatened to expel me from school .
Once when I was seven years old , I had to stand before all 12 teachers in the school .
Just move your lips and pretend . ”
When I told Mother what my teacher was doing , she reminded me of the Biblical account of the three young Hebrews before the image set up by the king of Babylon .
I felt very anxious , but my parents kept encouraging me .
Sometimes a neighbor would tell me : “ They have taken your mother away . ”
Deportation
They said that if my parents and my sister and I joined the Nazi party , we would not be deported .
The Gestapo drove us to the train station at Metz .
After three days on a train , we arrived at Kochlowice , a satellite camp of the Auschwitz complex in Poland .
Father and Mother refused , and our captors said , “ You will never return home . ”
Until then , we had stayed as a family separate from other prisoners .
We had read in The Watchtower of the great preaching work to be done after the war .
On February 19 , we began a forced march of almost 150 miles [ 240 km ] .
On May 5 , 1945 , after nearly two and a half years , we arrived home in Yutz , dirty and full of lice .
I remember my mother telling us : “ Let this be the most beautiful day of your life .
Even the clothes we are wearing are not ours .
My father baptized me in the Moselle River .
I wanted to become a pioneer immediately , but Father insisted that I learn a trade .
Gilead and Beyond
One brother gave me the nickname Kingdom Smile because of the smile on my face when I felt shy .
Five years later , I contracted tuberculosis and had to stop pioneering .

With Father and Mother at a convention in 1953
Today , some Christians choose a life of singleness , whereas many others remain single because of circumstances .
The desire to marry “ in the Lord ” helps many sisters like Ana to avoid marrying an unbeliever .
But knowing that similar things are being experienced by many others in the whole association of brothers in the world can encourage us to press forward with confidence .
Still , Jehovah understood their feelings , and he commended their whole - souled obedience to his covenant .
In other words , these faithful eunuchs would have the sure hope of enjoying everlasting life under Jesus ’ Messianic rule .
“ You must not take for yourself a wife , ” Jehovah said , “ and you must not come to have sons and daughters in this place . ”
The above - mentioned Bible characters were single , but they enjoyed Jehovah’s support and immersed themselves in his service .
Likewise today , meaningful activity can do much to enrich our lives .
“ As a single sister , I lead a busy , active life , which helps me to avoid loneliness .
This gives me great joy . ”
Many sisters have been able to learn a new language and have expanded their ministry by preaching to foreign - speaking people .
“ Learning a language I can use to communicate with many of them has opened up a new field of activity and made my preaching work so interesting . ”
“ I have made many close friends who come from different backgrounds and nationalities , and these friendships have greatly enriched my life . ”
Lydia , on the other hand , was an early Christian of Philippi whom the Bible commends for her hospitality .
Satisfying the Need to Be Loved
How can single people fill that need ?
25 : 14 ; Jas .
Many single Christians find great satisfaction in following the example of Dorcas , who “ abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy . ”
“ I have a satisfying life that depends on my relationship with Jehovah and my service to him , ” notes Lidiana .
This reality convinces me that my happiness does not depend on whether I get married in the future or not . ”
Undoubtedly , our greatest cause for joy is the knowledge that Jehovah will bless us for whatever sacrifice we make for the sake of doing his will .
Loli and Lidiana enjoy serving where the need is greater
God invites all his servants to draw close to him
Jehovah created his only - begotten Son and then , using his Son as “ a master worker , ” made the universe .
When God created the first human couple , he told them to “ fill the earth and subdue it . ”
What is involved in delegating ?
While delegating provides an opportunity for others to gain necessary skill and experience , it also allows the one delegating the responsibility to observe the abilities of those who have been given the task .
Why Some Hesitate
They may feel that they can do the job better and faster themselves .
Yet , consider Paul’s example .
What factors , though , should elders keep in mind when delegating ?
When a need to care for the daily food distribution arose in Jerusalem , the apostles selected ‘ seven certified men , full of spirit and wisdom . ’
If you ask an unreliable person to do a job , he may simply fail to carry it out .
On the other hand , when Jesus instructed his disciples to collect the leftovers of miraculously provided food , he left the details to them .
The one assigned should be equipped with funds , tools , and help as needed .
Likewise , in some cases it may be good to let the congregation know who is responsible for a certain task .
Caution is also in order .
Yet , if the brother who has been given a responsibility is allowed some leeway , he will likely gain confidence and experience .
Naturally , this does not mean being unconcerned about how he handles the task .
A brief review of the result can help him .
[ Box on page 29 ]
• a manifestation of wisdom and modesty
• a way to demonstrate trust in others
• Be concerned about the task , and express your trust

Some of them , though , simply walked away , making little effort to understand .
They also ignored a prophecy about the Messiah’s use of illustrations in his teaching . ​ — Ps .
For three and a half years , Jesus preached the good news in the land .
Yet , they remained fundamentally “ in ignorance ” about Jesus as the Messiah .
Hence , the apostle Peter exhorted many of them : “ Repent , therefore , and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out , that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for you , Jesus . ”
It is noteworthy that thousands of Jews began paying attention , including “ a great crowd of priests . ”
Rather , they repented and gained Jehovah’s favor . ​ — Acts 2 : 41 ; 4 : 4 ; 5 : 14 ; 6 : 7 .
Be Zealous for Jehovah’s House !
SONGS TO BE USED : 192 , 170
Why do true Christians need to resist any temptation to do so ?
God’s people have high regard for the faithful and discreet slave class .
This article clarifies such matters .
PAGE 3
It took me three years to finish !
Does the Author Want Us to Understand His Word ?
Does he want us to understand his Word ?
“ I did so because I realized that it is God’s Word , and even though I didn’t enjoy reading , I wanted to know what God had written in the Bible .
In the beginning I found it easy , but then I got to parts that I found difficult , and I stopped reading it . ”
How so ?
You have to ask for it in faith .
Jehovah will generously give holy spirit to those who sincerely ask for it .
That active force can help you to grasp the meaning of the inspired words written down in the Bible thousands of years ago .
THE apostle Paul warned what can happen if we fail to read the Bible with an open mind .
Yet , a rigid set of preconceived ideas prevented many of his countrymen from understanding God’s Word .
What can we learn from that experience ?
A veil of prejudice or preconceived ideas can hinder a reader from understanding Bible truth .
If a person were to read the Bible as “ a very human book , ” then would he not be inclined to discard direction or principles that do not suit his personal taste ?
In contrast , the Bible encourages us to study it diligently .
Regarding the Beroeans in Paul’s day , the Scriptures say : “ They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind , carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so . ”
Like those readers , you may need to lift any veil of bias or criticism that might blur your understanding .
Accept Help From Others
Accepting help from those who understood the land later saved Eyre’s life .
On one occasion , “ he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures . ”
Jesus commissioned his genuine followers to provide this help .
He encountered a passage that left him stumped .
The official asked Philip , an experienced Christian who was well - versed in the Scriptures : “ About whom does the prophet say this ?
About himself or about some other man ? ”
The words that followed applied to everyone in the nation .
Notice that Jehovah mentioned his own holiness , not as a standard to be equaled , but as a reason behind the commandment .
For one thing , we learn that in order to have a close relationship with him , we need to do our best to live in harmony with his standards of holy conduct .
He knows that we humans , who are made in his image , have within us the potential to cultivate holiness ​ — at least in a relative sense .
She Acted With Discretion
Now , one of Nabal’s young workmen , perhaps a shepherd , came to Abigail , trusting that she would come up with a plan to save them .
Nabal could hardly have chosen a better spouse , whereas Abigail found herself married to one who could hardly have been worse .
Abigail was altogether different .
Her name means “ My Father Has Made Himself Joyful . ”
This was the faithful servant of Jehovah whom Samuel the prophet had anointed , revealing David as God’s choice to succeed Saul as king .
Nabal lived in Maon but worked and likely owned land in nearby Carmel .
* Those towns gave access to grassy uplands suitable for raising sheep , of which Nabal owned 3,000 .
David chose the moment wisely .
How did Nabal respond ? ​ — 1 Samuel 25 : 5 - 8 .
Arming himself , David led 400 of his men to attack .
“ At once Abigail hastened , ” we read .
Again she hastened , this time to descend from her donkey and humble herself before David .
She took responsibility for the problem and asked David to forgive her personally .
Further , she urged David not to take any action that might bring bloodguilt upon him or that might later become “ a cause for staggering ” ​ — evidently referring to a troubled conscience .
David praised her for bravely hastening to meet him , and he acknowledged that she had restrained him from incurring bloodguilt .
He had a right to know .
He would be sober enough to understand her , yet more dangerous in his temper as well .
With that righteous execution , Abigail’s long nightmare of a marriage was over .
Besides the release from a bad marriage , Abigail had another blessing in store .
This was no fairy - tale ending ; Abigail’s life with David would not always be easy .
* And David was not yet king ; there would be obstacles and hardships to surmount before he served Jehovah in that way .
On one occasion he even rescued her from kidnappers !
David thus imitated Jehovah God , who loves and values such discreet , courageous , and faithful women .
[ Footnotes ]
In those days , it was Jehovah’s purpose for the descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob to dwell in that land .
Protecting it from foreign invaders and marauding bands was thus a form of sacred service .
As you read the scriptures , imagine that you are part of the event .
How do you picture the three visitors described at Genesis 18 : 2 ?

Even in this troubled world , you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God , his Kingdom , and his wonderful purpose for mankind .
IMAGINE how thrilling it must have been to hear Jesus teach !
For instance , Gospel writer Luke relates that people in Jesus ’ hometown “ began . . . to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth . ”
Those officers were not mistaken .
He skillfully used illustrations and questions .
A Key Quality ​ — Love
In contrast , Jesus was moved with pity for them , since they were “ skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ”
The religious leaders twisted God’s words to serve their own ends , but Jesus loved “ the word of God ” ​ — he taught it , explained it , defended it , and lived by it .
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is it important to teach with love ?
( b ) In teaching , why are knowledge and skill also important ?
As followers of Christ , we desire to imitate him in our ministry and in our life .
To be truly effective in our disciple - making work , we must imitate Jesus by teaching with love .
This is especially true when we talk about a person whom we love .
“ I love the Father , ” Jesus said .
Love for God motivated Jesus ’ disciples to do what ?
Like Jesus , his first - century disciples loved Jehovah , and this love moved them to preach the good news with courage and zeal .
They filled Jerusalem with their teaching , even though the powerful religious leaders opposed them .
The disciples simply could not stop speaking about the things they had seen and heard .
How can we strengthen our love for God ?
How can we do that ?
As we grow in knowledge of God , our hearts will be filled with love for him .
If a teacher cares about what he teaches , his enthusiasm will be evident , exerting a powerful influence on those whom he teaches .
On the other hand , if a teacher does not truly appreciate what he teaches , how can he expect his students to value what they are hearing ?
For I am not ashamed of the good news ; it is , in fact , God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith . ”
He wrote : “ To me , . . . this undeserved kindness was given , that I should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the Christ . ”
It is not difficult to imagine Paul’s enthusiasm as he taught others about Jehovah and His purposes .
It is a priceless gift that has been given to us , bringing us great joy .

For example , imagine yourself accompanying Jesus during his earthly ministry or traveling along with the apostle Paul .
Picture yourself in the new world , and envision how different life will be .
Reflect on the blessings you have received through your obedience to the good news .
We Must Love People
Why should a teacher love his students ?
He is sensitive to the abilities and circumstances of his students .
When teachers have such love , students will discern it , and teaching and learning are enjoyable .
In what ways did Jesus show love for people ?
He encouraged them by expressing confidence that they would be effective preachers of the good news .
No man has ever been a more loving teacher than Jesus .
18 , 19 . ( a ) Why are we willing to make sacrifices to carry out the preaching work ?
Like Jesus , we understand that our loving heavenly Father desires that people acquire the knowledge that leads to everlasting life .
love for what we teach ?
It opens the way to everlasting life , reveals God’s purpose , and shows us how to come into a loving relationship with him .
Explain Jesus ’ statement : “ I came to cause division . ”
Jesus told his disciples : “ Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth ; I came to put , not peace , but a sword .
Indeed , a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household . ”
Instead of embracing the good news , most people reject it .
This is to be expected .
Jesus said to his disciples : “ A slave is not greater than his master .
If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . ”
Boldness Needed to Face Enmity
The supreme example of courage and boldness was , of course , Jesus Christ .
Still , since the beginning of human history , boldness has always been needed by all of those loyal to Jehovah .
This enmity quickly became evident when Abel , a righteous man , was killed by his brother .
People hated Enoch and evidently would have murdered him had Jehovah not cut his life short .
5 : 21 - 24 .
Powerful , arrogant , and stubborn , Pharaoh was not accustomed to having others tell him what to do .
And what did Moses foretell ?
And what did he demand ?
Did Moses need boldness ?
Absolutely ! ​ — Num .
( b ) What enabled those in pre - Christian times to show boldness in upholding and promoting pure worship ?
Paul states : “ They were stoned , they were tried , they were sawn asunder , they died by slaughter with the sword , they went about in sheepskins , in goatskins , while they were in want , in tribulation , under ill - treatment . ”
No doubt , such prophets as Elijah , Jeremiah , and other faithful ones of pre - Christian times who boldly stood up for true worship were likewise helped to endure by keeping their eyes fixed on Jehovah’s promises . ​ — Titus 1 : 2 .
Moreover , Jeremiah and other bold servants of God in ancient times took courage because of Jehovah’s assurance , reflected in his promise to Jeremiah : “ They will be certain to fight against you , but they will not prevail against you , for ‘ I am with you , ’ is the utterance of Jehovah , ‘ to deliver you . ’ ”
Love Motivated Jesus to Preach Boldly
9 , 10 .
23 : 27 , 28 .
He added that they would see him “ sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven . ”
To Pilate , Jesus did say : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . ”
In the weeks following the death of Jesus , the disciples came to have reason to rejoice as Jehovah joined to them those being saved .
What talk this must have generated in that Jewish stronghold !

Our boldness may cause people to change their view of the Kingdom message .
A sister in Kyrgyzstan relates : “ While I was out in the preaching work , one householder told me : ‘ I believe in God but not in the Christian God .
If you come to this gate again , I will set my dog on you ! ’
Behind him was a large bulldog on a chain .
How did the boldness of a sister strengthen a fearful Bible student ?
In this world alienated from God , it takes boldness to preach as Jesus did .
• Why is boldness needed by God’s servants ?
Jesus Christ ?
“ GOD is love . ”
It is God’s love for mankind that makes it possible for us to draw close to him and to have a personal relationship with him .
That is true .
The apostle Paul called love the “ surpassing way . ”
To find out , let us take a closer look at the word “ love . ”
The ancient Greeks had four basic words , used in various forms , to describe love : stor·geʹ , eʹros , phi·liʹa , and a·gaʹpe .
The answer really is , Lack of natural affection .
It also motivates parents to give their children loving discipline when necessary and prevents parents from acting out of mere sentimentality , which often results in an overly permissive attitude toward children . ​ — Eph .
6 : 1 - 4 .
But history shows that such worship of sexual love only brought degradation , debauchery and dissolution .
Perhaps that is why the Bible writers made no use of the word . ”
For us to avoid getting involved in relationships based purely on physical attraction , romantic feelings must be tempered , or controlled , by Bible principles .
So ask yourself , ‘ Are my romantic feelings balanced with true love for my companion ? ’
Jesus said regarding married couples : “ What God has yoked together let no man put apart . ”
5 : 33 ; Heb .
There is nothing wrong with having a close friend in the congregation .
However , Paul also speaks of “ brotherly love ” ( phi·la·del·phiʹa ) and “ tender affection ” ( phi·loʹstor·gos , a compound word of phiʹlos and stor·geʹ ) .
According to one scholar , “ brotherly love ” is “ affectionate love , showing kindness , sympathy , offering help . ”
The Christian congregation is , not a social club or a secular organization , but a close - knit family united in the worship of Jehovah God .
May we all continue to contribute to the bond of love that unifies and identifies the true Christian congregation . ​ — John 13 : 35 .
A·gaʹpe is also used in negative contexts . ​ — John 3 : 19 ; 12 : 43 ; 2 Tim .

Father felt that I was too young , so I worked in an office for some time .
In 1931 at a convention in London , Brother Rutherford called for volunteers to spread the good news in foreign lands .
Preaching the Kingdom Message Abroad
Each morning for a week , I had to stand up to my neck in the cold water of a nearby river to ease the pain .
Lithuania was then dominated by the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox clergy .
Our main objective was to cover as much territory as possible and to leave as much Bible literature as we could with interested ones .
A risky assignment was to take Bible literature into neighboring Latvia , where our preaching was banned .
I “ declared ” what I described as literature that would help people in schools and colleges to understand the significance of what was happening in our very troubled world .
Privileges and Blessings in Northern Ireland
After World War II , our work could again be carried on without legal restraint .
“ This Saturday , ” he said , “ I will give the first open - air talk . ”
He looked at me and said , “ You will give the talk next Saturday . ”
We started a Bible study .
In time , nine members of Bill’s family became servants of Jehovah .
Later I called at large villas on the outskirts of Belfast , where I met a Russian woman who had lived in Lithuania .
When I showed her some literature , she pointed to one book and said : “ I have that one .
When John Sempey heard that I was going to Northern Ireland , he asked me to call on his younger sister , Nellie , as she had shown some interest in Bible truth .
My sister Connie and I conducted a Bible study with her .
It further said that the branch was preparing a history of the work in Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , and then it asked : “ Can you come ? ”
In Latvia , I was able to show the brothers the original apartment that was used as a branch office and the roof - space where we hid our literature , which was never found by the police .
You must have been the one who left those books at that house so many years ago ! ”
I can now rejoice , as the Bible psalmist did : “ God , you have taught me from my youth on , and until now I keep telling about your wonderful works .

Barry and Heidi have five children .
They find that working together to have the family Bible study helps them to make progress .
Mike says : “ At times , even the best - laid plans did not work out , but we found that cooperation helped us to get to the meetings on time . ”
Their son Michael remembers : “ Tuesday night we had a congregation meeting in our home .
Matthew , another son , adds : “ Dad made sure that he was home from work early on meeting nights to take the lead in getting us ready for the meeting . ”
Worth All the Effort
We have also had the privilege of working as a family on construction projects , even abroad . ”
Many people in Tuva live in remote communities that are hard to reach with the Kingdom message .
The group included teachers , psychologists , child - welfare inspectors , and others . ”
However , I prayed to Jehovah for courage to overcome my fear and use this opportunity to give a witness . ”
Did she succeed ?
Before long , the carton was empty .
It was Maria’s day off , so she placed literature on several tables in her office .
By the end of the seminar , Maria had placed 380 magazines , 173 books , and 34 brochures .
The Mosaic Law illustrates that truth .
Under the Law arrangement , Jehovah provided loving assistance for “ the afflicted one , ” such as the orphan , the widow , and the alien resident .
He knows that some of his servants may need help from their fellow worshippers .
Hence , none of his servants need to be reluctant to accept help from those who are moved by Jehovah to give such assistance .
Even so , when we accept help , we want to do so in the right spirit .
Still , although she was needy , that widow is remembered , not as someone who received , but as one who gave .
Her giving attitude must have brought her happiness because , as Jesus said , “ there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ”
Jehovah had sustained him during a period of “ distress and grief . ”
Hence , make sure that your worship of Jehovah remains the most important thing in your life and that you let God’s spirit guide you in everything you do .
In reality , of course , you can never fully repay Jehovah for all he has done for you .
In addition , we can use our talents , energies , and resources to share in the life - saving work that the congregation carries out .
“ You received free , ” said Jesus Christ .
Elders and others in the congregation want to console , support , and protect you during hard times . ​ — Gal .
5 : 14 .
Always accept with appreciation the support you receive .
Be Balanced and Reasonable
▪ Be a source of encouragement and spiritual refreshment to others
He found the nearly intact royal tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamen , containing nearly 5,000 objects .
However , God’s Word invites us to search for treasures that truly affect us .
The invitation is open to everyone , and the reward is worth far more than any material treasure . ​ — Read Proverbs 2 : 1 - 6 .
Why was Paul writing about spiritual treasures ?
Evidently , Paul was aware that the brothers there might have been influenced by some among them who were promoting certain Greek philosophies or were advocating a return to the observance of the Mosaic Law .
He strongly warned the brothers : “ Look out : perhaps there may be someone who will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men , according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ . ” ​ — Col .
Today , we face similar influences from Satan and his wicked system .
They needed to advance beyond a basic knowledge of the truth and have a clear understanding of the deeper things of God .
To say that all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge are “ concealed in ” Christ does not mean that they are locked away , out of the reach of anyone .
This is in harmony with what Jesus said about himself : “ I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me . ”
This indicates that his role is much more than that of being the means of approach to the Father .
Truly , concealed in Jesus are spiritual gems of incomparable value , waiting for careful students of the Bible to discover .
Let us examine some of the gems that directly affect our future prospects and our relationship with God .
What can we learn about Jesus from Colossians 1 : 19 and 2 : 9 ?
That explains why many of the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures are puzzling to those who do not accept Jesus as the promised Messiah .
( b ) Having been freed from religious darkness , Christ’s followers are under what obligation ?
( Read John 8 : 12 ; 9 : 5 . )
Many years later , the apostle Paul told his fellow Christians : “ You were once darkness , but you are now light in connection with the Lord .
Being freed from bondage to religious darkness , Christians are under obligation to walk as children of light .
( b ) Why is Jesus an incomparable treasure in his role as “ the Lamb of God ” ?
Jesus is “ the Lamb of God . ”
For instance , after Abraham had demonstrated that he was willing to offer his son Isaac , he was told not to harm Isaac and was provided with a ram , or male sheep , as a substitute .
Jesus , on the other hand , is “ the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world . ”
16 , 17 .
In that sense , their faith was incomplete .
And the Bible applied the term “ Amen ” to Jesus .
May it be your joy and blessing to find the treasures “ carefully concealed in him . ”
• Christians are urged to seek what treasures ?
2 : 21 .
( b ) What is one area of life in which the Bible provides direction ?
( a ) What did Jesus teach about marriage ?
The apostle Paul stated : “ A husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation , he being a savior of this body .
Let us consider some of the ways in which Jesus exercised his God - given authority .
How did Jesus exercise his authority over his disciples ?
Jesus was “ mild - tempered and lowly in heart . ”
Still , Jesus did not berate or humiliate them , nor did he make them feel unloved or incapable of carrying out what he was teaching them to do .
Instead , he praised and encouraged his disciples .
Rather , it is one marked by respect and self - sacrificing love .
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 7 . )
5 : 28 , 29 .
What a difference there is between his view of authority and the attitude displayed by the first human wife !
She had a divinely commissioned head through whom Jehovah communicated instruction .
She failed to accept the instruction that Adam conveyed to her .
Instead , she presumed to direct her husband . ​ — Gen .
2 : 14 .
Jesus , by contrast , provided the perfect model of submission to his Head .
His attitude and life course show that he “ gave no consideration to a seizure , namely , that he should be equal to God . ”
Today , as ruling King , Jesus maintains the same attitude .
15 : 28 .
Moreover , a Christian wife would certainly want to avoid contradicting her husband or challenging his opinion in front of their children .
What really are our family’s priorities ?
6 : 6 .
However , if children perceive a double standard , they might draw the conclusion that Bible principles are not really important or practical .
As a result , the children may be more inclined to weaken in the face of worldly pressure .
Christian parents realize that a child’s upbringing entails more than providing for his material needs .
Their example of self - sacrificing service may greatly help your children to make wise decisions , set praiseworthy goals , and get the appropriate schooling to be able to support themselves in the full - time service .
How did Jesus honor his earthly parents and his heavenly Father ?
Children , Jesus provides an excellent example for you too .
If so , how do you react ?
You know that if you allow yourself to be intimidated and go along with the crowd , you will disappoint your parents and Jehovah .
All of us , whatever our role in the family , can benefit from following his example .

How can we find them ?
This article can help us to find the answers .
Cooperation Promotes Spiritual Progress
They also teach their children to be unreasonable about money .
Why , though , does money cause so many problems in a marriage ?
At times , this fear makes me unreasonable with my wife about money matters . ”
The Bible is not a financial handbook .
But it does contain practical wisdom that can help a couple to avoid money problems .
“ With those consulting together there is wisdom . ”
For example , why not describe to your spouse how you think you might have been affected by your parents ’ attitude toward money ?
One Bible writer asked : “ Will two walk together unless they have met by appointment ? ”

“ In showing honor to one another take the lead . ”
If you and your spouse both earn money , you can honor each other by disclosing your income and major expenditures to each other .
“ If you plan and work hard , you will have plenty . ”
Next keep track of your actual expenses for several months .
We keep each other informed and work as partners . ”
Whatever your method , the key is to work together as a team .
As a result , we now work as a team , and our love has grown . ”
And how much effort went into preparing it ?
Bread was such an important part of the diet that in both Hebrew and Greek , the expression to “ eat a meal ” literally meant to “ eat bread . ”
But most families baked their own ​ — a task involving a considerable amount of labor .
Now think about Mary , Jesus ’ mother .
After Jesus was resurrected , he appeared to some of his disciples early one morning .
He then served them fresh fish and bread .
About 30 kinds of vegetables were available at the time ​ — onions , garlic , radishes , carrots , and cabbage , to name a few — ​ and more than 25 varieties of fruits , such as ( 1 ) figs , ( 2 ) dates , and ( 3 ) pomegranates , were grown in the area .
Can you visualize some of these ingredients on the table when Jesus shared an evening meal with Lazarus and his sisters , Martha and Mary ?
Now imagine the aroma that filled the room as Mary greased Jesus ’ feet with “ genuine nard ” ​ — the smell of food mingling with the scent of the costly perfumed oil . ​ — John 12 : 1 - 3 .
The host may also have offered meat ​ — a rare treat for a poor guest .
A more familiar sight would have been an egg dish of some sort .
What We Learn From Jesus
Did Jesus promise life in heaven ?
Jesus made this fact plain when he said to his disciples : “ Have no fear , little flock , because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 32 .
What hope did Jesus offer the rest of mankind ?
He was alluding to the inspired psalm that says : “ The meek ones themselves will possess the earth , and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace .
Jesus spoke of relief from two sources of oppression when he said : “ Now there is a judging of this world ; now the ruler of this world will be cast out . ”
For more information , see chapters 3 and 7 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
As she grows up , Rahab remembers what Jehovah did for his people .
During the night , the king of Jericho learns that Israelite spies have come into Jericho and that they have gone to the house where Rahab works .
So she hid them on the roof , and now she tells the king’s messengers : “ Yes , the men did come to me . . .
Why , do you think , has Rahab protected the spies ? — She explains why , telling them : “ I do know that Jehovah will certainly give you the land . . .
For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea from before you when you came out of Egypt . ”
Jehovah was certainly pleased that Rahab protected the spies , as the Bible tells us at Hebrews 11 : 31 .
If you do , everyone there will be safe . ’
Will you do the same ? — We pray that you will .
What important news did Rahab hear when she was young ?
What did Rahab have the spies promise ?
How do we know that Jehovah was pleased with Rahab , and how can you be like her ?

I also drank too much vodka and homemade wine .
After finishing military service , I moved to Germany .
While in a camp for immigrants , I received a copy of a Bible study handbook produced by the Witnesses .
And after reading the Bible study handbook I received , I was convinced that the Bible answered all the important questions in life .

The Scriptural basis for the hope of everlasting life on earth is presented in these articles .
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE :
Discovering Hidden Treasures
8 : 20 .
( b ) Why are many people skeptical about everlasting life on earth ?
After all , the hope of everlasting life is an essential aspect of the good news that we preach .
“ Subjected to Futility . . . on the Basis of Hope ”
Jehovah’s purpose for mankind was made evident at the very beginning of human history .
The entrance to the garden of Eden was blocked , and people grew old and died .
The Flood survivor Shem lived for only 600 years , and his son Arpachshad for 438 years .
Abraham’s father , Terah , lived for 205 years .
What basis did faithful men of old have for believing that God would restore the blessings that Adam had lost ?
It gave men like Abel and Noah a reason to believe that God would restore the blessings that Adam had lost .
What shows that Abraham had faith in the resurrection ?
( Read Hebrews 11 : 19 . )
Therefore , Abraham had sound reasons for expecting that God would resurrect Isaac .
6 , 7 . ( a ) What covenant did Jehovah make with Abraham ?
The Messianic Kingdom is the means by which “ all nations of the earth will . . . bless themselves . ”
That city is God’s Kingdom .
Everlasting life on earth will be possible for him through the resurrection .
However , the book of Job is not merely an account about one man’s trials ; it centers on issues of universal importance .
Although Job did not understand this issue , he did not allow his three companions to make him think that he had failed as an integrity keeper .
Jehovah sometimes gives a message to an individual that also has a broader application for mankind in general .
This can be seen from Daniel’s prophecy involving Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about the chopping down of an immense tree .
Those words indicated God’s willingness to accept “ a ransom , ” or “ covering , ” in behalf of repentant humans . ​ — Job 33 : 24 , ftn .
The book of Job also shows that there will be a resurrection . ​ — Job 14 : 14 , 15 .
Elderly ones among the survivors will return to the days of their youthful vigor .
The offspring of Abraham became an independent nation when they entered into a covenant relationship with God .
3 : 13 .
About what future blessing was David inspired to write ?
For example , the psalmist David concluded a psalm about the unity of true worshippers at Zion with the words : “ There Jehovah commanded the blessing to be , even life to time indefinite . ” ​ — Ps .
What prophetic role of the Messiah opens the way to everlasting life ?
Once a year , on Atonement Day , the high priest ‘ laid both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confessed over it all the errors of the sons of Israel , and he put them upon the head of the goat and the goat carried upon itself all their errors into a desert land . ’
Isaiah foretold the coming of the Messiah , who would play a similar role and carry away “ sicknesses , ” “ pains , ” and “ the very sin of many people , ” thus opening the way to everlasting life . ​ — Read Isaiah 53 : 4 - 6 , 12 .
The Hebrew Scriptures clearly set forth the hope of a resurrection and life on earth .
Because of the resurrection hope , Martha could say to Jesus concerning her dead brother : “ I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day . ”
21 : 4 .
As we discussed in the preceding article , centuries earlier God had given the Jews the hope of a resurrection and everlasting life on earth .
True , the Sadducees of the time denied the resurrection .
However , in his book Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era , George Foot Moore says : “ Writings . . . of the second or first centuries before our era attest the belief that at the expected turning - point in the history of the world the dead of former generations would be brought to life again on earth . ”
What questions will be considered in this article ?
Most people hope for an afterlife in the spirit realm .
What did his disciples believe ?
What is to take place “ in the re - creation ” ?
How would you define “ the re - creation ” ?
These subjects will enjoy everlasting life on earth .
Let us examine some of those occurrences to see what Jesus said about the hope of everlasting life on earth .
Those entering the Kingdom of the heavens must be “ born again . ”
He then spoke of the hope that is open to the whole world .
( Read John 3 : 16 . )
There he restored a sick man to health at the pool of Bethzatha .
In Galilee , thousands of people who wanted bread miraculously provided by Jesus began following him .
Jesus gave his life not only for those who would rule with him in his heavenly Kingdom but also “ in behalf of the life of the world ” of redeemable mankind .
“ If anyone eats of this bread , ” that is , exercises faith in the redeeming power of Jesus ’ sacrifice , he will be in line for everlasting life .
And I give them everlasting life . ”
However , when that one arrives , the spirit of the truth , he will guide you into all the truth . ”
The hope of a heavenly inheritance was a revelation , and it became the focus of the inspired letters in the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Jesus will then fulfill God’s promise : “ The righteous themselves will possess the earth , and they will reside forever upon it . ” ​ — Ps .
He wrote : “ The heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men . ”
What will replace the governmental heavens and the wicked human society that are present now ?
How is mankind’s hope described at Revelation 21 : 1 - 4 ?
• What did Jesus mean by “ the re - creation ” ?
Everlasting Life on Earth ​ — A Hope Rediscovered
At the beginning of human history , God revealed that man was made , not to live a few years and then die , but to live forever . ​ — Gen .
The apostle Peter warned Christians : “ There will also be false teachers among you . ”
5 , 6 .
Origen was a pupil of Clement of Alexandria , who borrowed the idea of an immortal soul from Greek tradition .
Consequently , Origen shifted the earthly blessings of the Millennium to the spiritual realm .
Before converting to “ Christianity ” at the age of 33 , Augustine had become a Neoplatonist ​ — an adherent of a version of Plato’s philosophy developed by Plotinus in the third century .
It adds : “ This explanation . . . was adopted by succeeding Western theologians , and millenarianism in its earlier shape no longer received support . ”
According to this view , a person’s life on earth is intended to be transitory ​ — a test to determine if he is worthy of life in heaven .
As the Jews gradually adopted the Greek idea of inherent immortality , their original hope of life on earth faded .
How different this is from the way man is presented in the Bible !
Jehovah said to the first man : “ Dust you are . ”
The earth , not heaven , is man’s everlasting home . ​ — Read Psalm 104 : 5 ; 115 : 16 .
Truth Flashes Up in the Darkness
Although most religions that claim to be Christian deny the hope of everlasting life on earth , Satan did not always succeed in obscuring the truth .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What did Isaac Newton write about mankind’s hope ?
And Newton saw no Christian movement that could preach it .
Why did mankind’s hope remain obscure for most people in the days of Milton and Newton ?
The Reformation of the 16th century failed to reform the teaching about inherent immortality , and mainstream Protestant churches continued to teach Augustine’s idea that the Millennium was past , not future .
When was the true knowledge to become abundant ?
As regards “ the time of the end , ” Daniel foretold a very positive development .
In the late 1800 ’ s , a number of sincere individuals were searching for an understanding of “ the pattern of healthful words . ”
In 1870 he and a few other truth - seekers formed a class for Bible study .
Dunn also examined a question that had puzzled many , Who will live forever on earth ?
In 1870 , George Storrs also came to the conclusion that the unrighteous will be resurrected to an opportunity of everlasting life .
Storrs lived in Brooklyn , New York , and edited a magazine called the Bible Examiner .
What set the Bible Students apart from Christendom ?
So in 1879 , he started publishing Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence , now called The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom .
The prophet Isaiah was inspired to write about the kind of life that God’s people will enjoy on earth .
Augustine claimed that the Thousand Year Reign of God’s Kingdom was not future but had already begun with the founding of the church .
• How did mankind’s hope of life on earth become obscured ?
• What understanding did some Bible readers gain in the 1600 ’ s ?
His love for mankind is so immense that he even sent his beloved Son here to earth to die in our behalf .
He said : “ If you observe my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) What is the primary way we can show that we love Jehovah ?
Primarily , we show that we love Jehovah by obeying him .
Notice , though , the phrase : “ Yet his commandments are not burdensome . ”
Jehovah is not asking us to do something that is too hard for us .
Without his compass , this hiker would be hopelessly lost .
Similarly , a human without a conscience would often be hopelessly lost when trying to make moral , ethical , and righteous choices in life .

Similarly , if we do not rely on the sure , unchanging guidance of God’s Word , the Bible , our conscience might be nearly useless .
Sadly , many people in this world give undue prominence to the desires of the heart while paying little or no attention to the standards set out in God’s Word .
( Read Ephesians 4 : 17 - 19 . )
At the same time , we should endeavor to respect the consciences of our beloved spiritual brothers and sisters .
We make every effort to avoid stumbling them , keeping in mind that our brother’s conscience may be more sensitive or restrictive than our own . ​ — 1 Cor .
3 : 16 .
Let us now consider three areas of life in which we can demonstrate our love for Jehovah by means of obedience .
First , we must love those whom Jehovah loves .
Our Creator well knows how dangerous ​ — and how helpful — ​ associations can be for imperfect humans .
That is the kind of friend Jehovah chooses .
He befriends such people today .
Studying Bible examples can prove motivating .
Be assured that the Christian congregation is rich with potential for finding friends of that kind .
Such friends will not lead you to fare badly in a spiritual sense .
They will help you to remain in God’s love .
For one thing , humans in positions of authority are imperfect .
If we choose Jehovah as our Sovereign , we need to respect his authority .
Remain Clean in Jehovah’s Eyes
Why does Jehovah want us to remain clean ?
Furthermore , a clean child reflects well on the family , revealing the love and attention of the parents .
He knows that cleanliness is essential to our well - being .
In ancient Israel , Jehovah made it clear to his people that physical cleanliness was essential .
In what ways do we need to remain clean ?
We need , then , to be clean on the inside as well as on the outside .
But Jehovah’s people strive to do so because this helps them remain in God’s love .
More than that , this book is designed to help us see that obedience to Jehovah is not a burden .
How has this happened without the advantage of the spoken word ?
Before answering that question , let us consider why sign language is important to deaf people .
Seeing Is Hearing
Let us clear up some of them .
Lipreading is extremely difficult for them .
Sign language has nothing in common with Braille , and it is not simply pantomime .
There is not one universal sign language .
Consider how a child with the ability to hear learns a language .
You see only that their lips are moving .
How well do you think you would do ?
A person uses signs to set up concepts in the space surrounding his body .
In fact , almost every move a deaf person makes with his hands , body , and face while signing has meaning .
They are an integral part of the grammar of sign language .
To illustrate : Asking a question with the eyebrows raised could indicate either a rhetorical question or one that elicits a yes or no answer .
He then proceeded to explain the meaning of the material to me .
Her mother then realized that she was able to understand everything on the DVD . ”
I feel that the sign - language DVDs have had the greatest impact on me in terms of my own spiritual growth . ”
Has the formation of sign - language congregations been of value ?
As a member of that congregation , how did Cyril feel ?
Some have moved to other countries to help the deaf learn about Jehovah .
Christian men who are deaf learn to be effective teachers , organizers , and shepherds , and many are then able to qualify to care for responsibilities in the congregation .
These are but a few examples of the growth taking place worldwide .
These events enable deaf Witnesses to see that they are part of a worldwide Christian brotherhood benefiting from timely spiritual food .
But during one particular talk at a sign - language district convention , I finally understood the issues involved .
When the talk was over , my wife elbowed me and asked , ‘ Are you satisfied ? ’
What “ expressions ” on Jehovah’s face are deaf people seeing upon learning about him ?
Under cover of darkness , they started out that evening .
When they arrived at the camp , it was silent .
Jehovah had miraculously caused the Syrians to hear the sound of a military force .
Personal Concerns Can Weigh Us Down
They focused on what they could get .
Can something similar happen to us ?
“ Food shortages ” form part of the composite sign marking the time of the conclusion of the system of things .
She served as a pioneer , completed a period of schooling , eventually married a Bethelite , and was accepted as a member of the Benin Bethel family .
The original - language word for “ greeting ” may mean more than a mere “ hello ” or “ good - day . ”
After they were released , they served as pioneers until they finished their earthly course .
However , spiritual matters took top priority in their lives .
Of course , all of us cherish maintaining some communication with our loved ones , and there is nothing wrong with that .
Well - chosen variation in our daily routine is beneficial .
Perhaps you were a ministerial servant or an elder .
Such decisions are not a mark of failure .
Not in most cases .
If you are willing to show that love by serving again , this will allow Jehovah to make use of the experience you have had both before and after the loss of your privilege .
Recall the assurance Jehovah gave Israel after that nation had deservedly lost privileges of service .
To “ grow mighty ” in the faith , you must “ search for Jehovah and his strength . ”
One way you can do this is through heartfelt prayer .
With fewer responsibilities for the time being , you may be able to do more with regard to personal and family study , perhaps restoring a routine that had been difficult to maintain .
Of course , you still represent Jehovah as one of his Witnesses .
Negative feelings may linger , hindering you from reaching out or even making it difficult for you to learn from the experience .
Let us consider how the experiences of Job , Manasseh , and Joseph can help one to cope with negative feelings .
Then , at a crucial time in his life , Job lost his wealth , his children , and his health .
Job felt entirely innocent and wanted to defend himself before God .
If your loss of a privilege was due to wrongdoing on your part , you may wonder whether Jehovah and your Christian brothers will ever truly forgive and forget .
Yet , Manasseh died a faithful man , ruling as king .
How did this happen ?
Manasseh eventually responded to discipline .
There , Manasseh “ softened the face of Jehovah his God and kept humbling himself greatly because of the God of his forefathers .
And he kept praying to Him . ”
At the age of 17 , Joseph was unjustly sold into slavery by his brothers .
This was certainly not the kind of treatment that he expected from the sons of his father .
All three men accepted what Jehovah allowed , and each of them learned valuable lessons .
With Jehovah’s loving correction , however , he regained balance , admitting : “ I talked , but I was not understanding . ”
Yet , he accepted it , repented , and abandoned his wrong course .
Be patient and willing .
Joseph’s experiences could easily have led him to nurse feelings of hatred and revenge .
If you have been disappointed , be patient .
Be willing to be trained by Jehovah .
Did you once serve in a responsible position in the Christian congregation ?
Strengthen your spirituality .
Temper your feelings with patience and humility .
Upon removing the board , they found a groove about 4 inches [ 10 cm ] wide , 50 inches [ 1.2 m ] long , and 4 inches [ 10 cm ] deep , covered with a matching piece of wood .
What were the treasures ?
Who hid them there ?
Out of the cache came several packets carefully wrapped in heavy paper .
( 2 ) The packets contained literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses , mostly Watchtower study articles , including some from 1947 .
Some of the packets contained clues as to who hid the material there .
Those were records of interrogations of Alma’s husband , Villem Vardja .
Why had he been imprisoned ?
He must have wanted to protect her in case of an interrogation .
It too had been hidden by Villem Vardja .
Why do we call these documents treasures ?
Because these painstakingly handwritten and carefully hidden copies speak eloquently of the appreciation the Witnesses had for the spiritual food available at that time .
• Is a resurrection possible if a developing child dies before it is born ?
Jehovah can resurrect individuals of whatever stage of life because “ all things are possible with God . ”
But the Bible does not directly say whether he will resurrect unborn children who died in the womb . ​ — 4 / 15 , pages 12 , 13 .
Thus , they magnify God’s wisdom . ​ — 4 / 15 , pages 16 - 19 .
In 1909 the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society , the legal arm of the publishing organization used by Jehovah’s Witnesses , was moved from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to Brooklyn , New York , where it continues active . ​ — 5 / 1 , pages 22 - 24 .
• What do John Wycliffe , William Tyndale , Robert Morrison , and Adoniram Judson have in common ?
Disagreements over money are often about trust or fear , and marriage mates may have different backgrounds .
‘ God wants you to be rich ​ — cars in the garage , a prosperous business .
Just believe in him , open your wallet , and give him everything you can . ’
But does God really promise riches to those who serve him ?
With 318 “ trained men ” capable of bearing arms , Abraham’s household must have been of considerable size .
Yes , many of God’s faithful servants in the past ​ — Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , David , Solomon , to name just a few — ​ were rich .
Consider Mary , the mother of Jesus .
Yet , she was not wealthy .
In fact , the majority of Christians in the first century were of limited means .
Furthermore , the apostle Paul also said that not many “ wise in a fleshly way ” or “ powerful ” or “ of noble birth ” were called to become part of the Christian congregation . ​ — 1 Corinthians 1 : 26 .
If the riches that Jesus gave his followers were not material ones , what kind of riches did he give them ?
Faith of itself is precious because it “ is not a possession of all people . ”
In addition to all these benefits , those who put faith in God through his Son , Jesus Christ , have the marvelous prospect of life everlasting .
While God’s blessings are basically of a spiritual kind , there are emotional and physical benefits as well .
Take , for example , Dalídio in Brazil .
He made so much spiritual progress that he said , “ I used to go from bar to bar ; now I go from house to house . ”
Dalídio now enjoys peace of mind and contentment beyond anything he could have imagined before coming to know God .
When you see his happy , smiling face today , it is difficult to believe that he has had every reason to feel that he had been given a raw deal in life .
They at first thought that someone had left a kitten there .
Perhaps you long to have a close and loving relationship with God , which can truly enrich your life .
And he promises that those who come to him with the right motive and attitude will be richly rewarded : “ The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life . ” ​ — Proverbs 22 : 4 . [ Blurb on page 6 ]

Many of God’s faithful servants were materially poor .
And death could leave behind orphans and widows .
The account of Naomi and Ruth is a heartwarming example of Jehovah’s loving care for the needy .
She was making a lot of money and dealing in huge sums for her clients .
Sonia regularly worked 18 hours a day , and some nights she got only two or three hours of sleep .
Her job was her life .
She was only 30 years of age .
Gradually , Sonia’s speech returned , and she made rapid spiritual progress as well .
‘ I want to be like that too , ’ Sonia thought .
I’ve come to realize that the most important thing in life is having a good relationship with my heavenly Father , Jehovah .
“ The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things , ” wrote the apostle Paul .
SERVING as a missionary in a developing country , I never get used to seeing poverty and hopelessness .
I want to see immediate relief from suffering for everyone .
Yet , time and again I have seen that people who follow God’s Word find happiness despite dire circumstances .
As she awaited his return , months turned into years , but he never came home .
I offered to study the Bible with her and her daughters .
She cooks the meat filling for the empanadas that she sells to earn her family’s livelihood .
Without looking up , a sleepy - eyed man raises two fingers , and she serves him two golden - brown , piping hot empanadas .
Soon she decided that despite her grueling schedule , she too would study the Bible with me .
Finally , she accepted my invitation to visit the Kingdom Hall .
But she said , “ I tremble whenever I think about preaching publicly . ”
She also realized that her daughters looked to her as an example .
Today , Sabina is no longer just another poor woman toiling day after joyless day .
It is 5 : 00 a.m . , and Sabina is ready once again to leave her one - room dwelling .
Tucked inside are her Bible and the Bible literature that she will use to spread hope to others .
He is firm for what is right .
The people complained that the wilderness was an “ evil place ” that had no “ figs and vines and pomegranates ” ​ — the very fruit that Israelite spies had brought back from the Promised Land years before — ​ and that there was “ no water to drink . ”
Jehovah did not reject the murmurers .
Instead , he directed Moses to do three things : take his rod , gather the people , and “ speak to the crag before their eyes that it [ might ] indeed give its water . ”
“ You men rebelled against my order , ” God said to them .
By going against God’s order on this occasion , Moses and Aaron became what they accused the people of being ​ — rebels .
Fourth , Moses and Aaron were Israel’s leaders .
Because he loves justice , he is incapable of handing down sentences that are unfair or unjust .
But when ten spies brought back a bad report , the people murmured against Moses .
In the workforce , an increasing number of disgruntled employees seek revenge against their employers by damaging or deleting important information on the company’s computer network .
Others steal company secrets and sell them or give them away .
To combat the threat of revenge , many companies have resorted to having a security officer escort a dismissed employee to his desk , wait for him to clear out his things , and walk him off the premises .
Yes , instead of settling matters , their vengeful actions had the opposite effect ; Jacob’s family now had to be wary of counterattacks by angry neighbors .
Thus , the German proverb is proved true : Revenge does not long remain unrevenged .
Indeed , how can a person be joyful if hatred and destructive feelings are bottled up inside of him ?
How so ?
During his earthly ministry , Jesus was spit upon , flogged , and persecuted by his enemies , betrayed by a close associate , and even abandoned by his own followers .
How did he react ?
Yes , Christians are encouraged to imitate Jesus , including his suffering injustices .
They also take to heart this admonition : “ Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil , but keep conquering the evil with the good . ”
Does this mean that if we are the victim of a crime or are threatened in some other way , we should just meekly accept it ?
By no means !
Nevertheless , it is good to keep in mind that true justice in this system of things can be elusive .
Satan would like nothing better than to see people torn apart by vengeance and hate .
By leaving matters in Jehovah’s hands , we free ourselves from much pain , rage , and violence . ​ — Proverbs 3 : 3 - 6 .
“ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind ” and “ You must love your neighbor as yourself ”

Keep Christ’s Mental Attitude in You
Christ’s Love Moves Us to Love
PAGE 21
SONGS TO BE USED : 91 , 59
We know that in many ways Jesus was a model for Christians .
You will find examples that you can apply in your family and in the congregation as well as when coping with challenges .
This article will help us to reflect on the remarkable benefits of divine education .
Religion ​ — My Choice or My Parents ’ ?
Keep Christ’s Mental Attitude in You
“ COME to me , ” said Jesus Christ . “ Learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment for your souls . ”
This warm invitation well expresses Jesus ’ loving mental attitude .
Although he was the mighty Son of God , Jesus displayed empathy and tenderness , especially toward those in need .
What aspects of Jesus ’ attitude will we consider ?
Some of those would later kill him .
Later , when Peter , James , and John failed to “ keep on the watch , ” Jesus sympathetically acknowledged their weakness .
While we may be prepared to accept fleshly traits as normal in Satan’s world , facing such imperfections among our brothers can be particularly trying .
If the flaws of others easily annoy us , we need to ask ourselves , ‘ How can I better reflect “ the mind of Christ ” ? ’
Jesus then pointed to his own example : “ Just as the Son of man came , not to be ministered to , but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many . ” ​ — Matt .
How can each of us contribute to unity in the congregation ?
By thus following the pattern of humility and mildness that Jesus provided , we will please our heavenly Father , Jehovah .
He felt pity for the people “ because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ” ​ — Matt .
He told them : “ Let the young children come to me ; do not try to stop them , for the kingdom of God belongs to suchlike ones . ”
What benefits do children derive from wholesome attention ?
By imitating Jesus , each of us can contribute to that wholesome atmosphere .
In these “ last days , ” such problems may be on the rise , but they are by no means new .
This involves putting Christlike kindness to work .
• How did Jesus display kindness ?
• What are some ways we show Christlike mildness and kindness in this imperfect world ?
“ Take courage !
I have conquered the world . ” ​ — JOHN 16 : 33 .
JESUS CHRIST always did God’s will .
Not once did he even entertain the thought of disobeying his heavenly Father .
2 , 3 .
For this reason , the apostle Paul counseled Christians : “ Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus , ” who “ humbled himself and became obedient as far as death . ”
Obedient Despite Imperfection
It means that we can decide to do good or to do bad .
Paul faced this struggle .
6 , 7 .
You have just prayed for Jehovah’s spirit to help you to apply what you learn from his Word .
You also recall Paul’s advice at Philippians 4 : 8 .
Will you go ahead and watch that movie anyway ?
Why must we maintain high moral and spiritual standards ?
Instead , we must protect ourselves and our children from the corrupting influences of Satan’s spirit .
Why must we be determined every day to obey Jehovah ?
Clearly , this calls for developing true courage , such as Jesus displayed . ​ — Ps .
Jesus ​ — The Foremost Example of Courage
Surrounded as we are by this world’s attitudes and conduct , we need courage to resist contamination .
Christians deal with moral , social , financial , and religious pressures that could cause them to deviate from Jehovah’s righteous ways .
In some countries , educational institutions promote the theory of evolution ever more aggressively , and atheism is gaining more attention .
Jesus ’ example shows us how we can succeed .
When soldiers came to arrest Jesus on his last night on earth , he courageously stepped forward to protect his disciples , saying : “ If . . . it is I you are looking for , let these go . ”
Jesus took a courageous stand even against the demons .
Unintimidated , Jesus expelled the many demons that held the man in their control .
Today , God has not given Christians the power to perform such miracles .
Again , Jesus ’ example guides us .
Often he prefaced his words with the statement : “ It is written , ” that is , in God’s Word .
And we must pray for holy spirit because faith is part of the spirit’s fruitage . ​ — Gal .
Kitty prayed for Christlike courage , discretion , and the right opportunity .
The teacher even used Kitty as a good example of standing up for one’s beliefs .
Show Christlike Faith and Courage
( b ) How can we bring Jehovah delight ?
( Read Luke 17 : 5 , 6 . )
Having real faith means more than merely believing that God exists .
Therefore , let us always imitate Jesus ’ example , taking a courageous stand for righteousness !
• What will enable us to remain obedient despite being imperfect ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
JESUS set the perfect example of love .
To the very end of his life on earth , Jesus showed love toward those whom he met and especially toward his disciples .
We will also discuss how Jesus ’ love moves Christians to take positive action in times of hardship , disaster , and illness .
Knowing the damage the person has already caused , they may be tempted to express their own feelings about the individual’s actions and attitude .
Jesus warned some in his day in no uncertain terms , but never once did he say anything that was hateful or was intended to cause pain .
Rather , he left the way open for wrongdoers to repent and return to Jehovah’s favor .
It is tragic that some are unrepentant and must be disfellowshipped , yet it is heartwarming to know that a large number of such ones later return to Jehovah and his congregation .
When elders show a Christlike attitude , they help to smooth the way for the person to have a change of heart and eventually to return .
They should never rush to put a wrongdoer out of the congregation .
After the Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem in 66 C.E . , obedient ones acted on these instructions .
But Jesus ’ prophecy reached far beyond the razing of that ancient city .
What kind of love do we need to develop now , and why ?
They are to “ love one another intensely from the heart . ”
Already , pressures on all of God’s people are intensifying .
No one should put his confidence in any element of this old world , as the recent turmoil in the world’s financial system vividly demonstrates .
And Peter emphasized the point further , saying : “ Above all things , have intense love for one another , because love covers a multitude of sins . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
In order to make their new home available to relief workers .
How is that demonstrated ?
As one evidence , elders show that they have Christ’s mental attitude by making and monitoring arrangements to help sick ones in the congregation , following in principle the course of action mentioned at Matthew 25 : 39 , 40 .
* ( Read . )
How did two sisters display genuine love toward another , and with what results ?
Consider the case of 44 - year - old Charlene , who had cancer and was told she had ten days to live .
I will be grateful to them forever .
May we also strive to treat others kindly , even when their imperfections and weaknesses come to the fore .
Let us courageously obey all of Jehovah’s requirements , even in the face of trials .
• How can elders display Christ’s mental attitude toward wrongdoers ?

His academic achievements as a high - school student qualified him to attend any of the best universities in his country .
Some choose not to make full use of those opportunities so that they can pursue spiritual goals .
What motivates Christians like Robert to expend themselves in the preaching work ?
Reflecting on some of the outstanding blessings we enjoy as a result of being taught by Jehovah will help us to maintain our appreciation for the good news and to be zealous in sharing it with others .
Why can we be sure that Jehovah is willing to teach imperfect humans ?
This is clear from a prophecy that is being fulfilled in our day .
Do you not feel drawn to a God who “ gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones ” ? ​ — 1 Pet .
People have taken in “ the knowledge of Jehovah ” and have applied it in their lives .
He wrote : “ The weapons of our warfare are not fleshly , but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things . For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God . ”
It improves family life .
Later , another officer asked her , “ Why did you choose to turn in the chain ? ”
Colossians 3 : 10 says : “ Clothe yourselves with the new personality , which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it . ”
( Read Hebrews 4 : 12 . )
By coming to an accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and by conforming his life to Jehovah’s righteous standards , a person can become a friend of God , with the prospect of living forever .
Preparation for the Future
He determines what mankind’s future will be .
Regarding that day , the words of Proverbs 11 : 4 will prove true : “ Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury , but righteousness itself will deliver from death . ”
The apostle Paul wrote to Timothy : “ Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high - minded , and to rest their hope , not on uncertain riches , but on God . ”
What does it involve ?
Am I slaving for God or for Riches ? ’ ​ — Matt .
( Read 1 Corinthians 1 : 18 - 21 . )
As we help others to benefit from divine education , we put ourselves in line to receive many blessings .
14 , 15 .
Robert , mentioned at the outset , speaks for many when he says : “ I have no regrets whatsoever .
10 : 22 .
Have there been times when you sensed the help of his spirit as you were presenting the good news ?
Has Jehovah helped you to overcome obstacles , perhaps opening the way for you to expand your ministry ?
Is it not a blessing to be one of “ God’s fellow workers ” in the grand work of divine education ? ​ — 1 Cor .
How do you feel about the efforts and sacrifices you make in connection with divine education ?

Do You Value What Jehovah Has Done to Deliver You ?
What has our deliverance cost Jesus ?
What has it cost Jehovah ?
While they may infect fewer people , they kill a higher percentage of the people they do infect .
( Read Romans 3 : 23 . )
Paul wrote that sin brings death “ to all men . ”
Many today do not see sin and death in such dire terms .
If we see the severity of the “ disease ” that afflicts us , we can better appreciate the value of the “ cure ” ​ — our deliverance .
But for us , he holds out the hope of deliverance . ​ — Ps .
In the prophecy recorded at Genesis 3 : 15 , we learn something about the cost of deliverance .
There were early indications that a sacrifice would be required .
Among the most important sacrifices required by the Law were those offered on the annual Day of Atonement .
On that day , the high priest carried out a series of symbolic actions .
There he sprinkled the blood of the sacrifices before the ark of the covenant .
25 : 22 ; Lev .
( b ) What was represented by the high priest’s entry into the Most Holy ?
The Messiah would have to sacrifice his life !
The prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures presented this truth in vivid terms .
Isaiah foretold that the Messiah would be rejected , persecuted , and executed , or pierced , to bear the sins of imperfect humans . ​ — Isa .
Before he came to the earth , God’s only - begotten Son was aware of what our deliverance would cost him .
He would have to suffer terribly and then be put to death .
So our deliverance is due , in large part , to the love of Jehovah’s Son .
What Our Deliverance Cost Jehovah
The apostle Paul indicated that the altar at the temple , upon which the sacrifices were offered , represented Jehovah’s will .
So the deliverance we receive by means of Christ’s sacrifice is something we owe first and foremost to Jehovah .
13 , 14 .
How can Abraham’s example help us appreciate what Jehovah has done in our behalf ?
Jehovah asked the faithful man Abraham to do something supremely difficult ​ — to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice .
Still , Abraham saw that doing Jehovah’s will was even more important than his love for Isaac .
Complete forgiveness became available , first for the sins of Christ’s anointed brothers , then for “ the whole world’s . ” Because of that sacrifice , today all who sincerely repent of their sins and become genuine followers of Christ can enjoy a clean standing before Jehovah God .
In a far greater sense , each of us should be eager to show Jehovah just how much we appreciate the deliverance that he has made possible through the ransom sacrifice of his Son . ​ — Read Romans 6 : 17 , 18 .
Surely Jehovah and his Son are worth every bit of the time and energy we can devote to praising them !

Religion ​ — My Choice or My Parents ’ ?
IN Poland quite a few people say to Jehovah’s Witnesses , “ I was born into my religion , and I will die in it . ”
Timothy knew the holy writings “ from infancy . ”
“ I simply started praying , ” Albert says .
I had to force myself to do so .
25 : 14 ; Jas .
Yet , if you learned the rules and became good at the game , would you not look forward to playing it , even making opportunities to do so ?
So take the initiative to prepare for Christian meetings .
Get involved .
10 : 24 , 25 .
This too should be done out of love , not out of compulsion .
Ask yourself : ‘ Why do I want to tell others about Jehovah ?
What may this require of you ?
Rather than putting into the mind of your children what you may have wanted to achieve , how wonderful it would be if you could help them make it their goal in life to live in harmony with Jehovah’s purposes !
“ We talked a lot about various avenues of the full - time ministry , ” recall Ewa and Ryszard , the parents of three sons .
Ryszard says , “ We were determined not to lead a double life , acting one way at home and another way in the congregation . ”
Be discerning , look for signs of any problem that may lurk in your children’s heart , and take action immediately .
Why not ask the young ones how they feel about the congregation ?
Otherwise , they might focus on pursuing worldly goals .
If I am not yet baptized , do I have baptism as a goal ? ’
41 : 10 .
Little did he realize that , in time , many would abandon Catholicism .
Before long , we had a young son to care for .
I wondered where to turn for guidance .
In 1964 a young man called Eugenio visited our home .
He was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , a religion I had never heard of before .
Eugenio showed me from the Bible that we are living in the last days and that God’s Kingdom will soon usher in a paradise earth .
9 : 6 , 7 ; Matt .
Now my efforts to improve my social status seemed irrelevant , and my struggle to cope with work problems became of minor importance .
I had other relatives in Durango , a small town some 80 miles [ 120 km ] away , where no Witnesses lived .
For the next 20 years , I concentrated on bringing up our two boys and helping the local congregation .
When Mercedes and I moved to Logroño , there were only about 20 Witnesses in that city of some 100,000 inhabitants .
Draw Close to God
TO OBEY or not to obey ​ — the decision is not always an easy one .
* This is not a morbid dread of bad consequences but , rather , a healthy , reverential regard for God and his ways .
One reference work explains : “ Hebrew verbs for feelings sometimes refer as well to the actions that result from them . ”
Jehovah wants us to do everything that he asks of us .
Hence , he has given only such commands as would further our lasting welfare .

NOAH’S son Shem survived the end of one world , and he lived on into another one .
Jesus talked about this .
What did those people fail to note , or see ? — Shem’s father , Noah , was “ a preacher of righteousness , ” but the people did not listen to what he was saying .
Noah listened to God and built an ark , a floating vessel , that would carry him and his family safely through the Flood .
The rest did only what they wanted to do , so they were swept away in the Flood . ​ — 2 Peter 2 : 5 ; 1 Peter 3 : 20 .
About a year after the Flood began , Shem and his family came out of the ark onto dry land .
All bad people were gone , but that soon changed .
Nimrod , a grandson of Ham , was bad too .
Do you know what Jehovah did ? — He confused the language of people so that they could not understand one another .
But God did not change the language of Shem and his family .
Have you ever thought about how long Shem served Jehovah ? —
He lived for 98 years before the Flood and 502 years afterward .
Then , with God’s help we can live on forever in happiness on earth ! ​ — 1 John 2 : 17 ; Psalm 37 : 29 ; Isaiah 65 : 17 .
What world did Shem first live in , and for what two reasons did God destroy it ?
How long did Shem live , and what kind of man was he ?
What will soon happen to this world ?
The wind that whipped his hair about had churned the Sea of Galilee into a rage .
Let us see how .
“ We Have Found the Messiah ” !
With those words , Peter’s life began to change .
We can imagine the countless long nights of labor ​ — the men letting out the dragnets between two boats and hauling aboard whatever catch the lake afforded .
He foresaw that Peter would become like a rock ​ — a stable , sturdy , and reliable influence among Christ’s followers .
Even some modern - day readers of the Gospel accounts see little that is rocklike in Peter .
“ Stop Being Afraid ”
Peter likely accompanied Jesus on part of the preaching tour that ensued .
Some months later , though , Peter was again face - to - face with Jesus ​ — and this time Jesus invited Peter to follow him full - time as a way of life .
Finally , he came ashore empty - handed .
What would they live on ?
He said : “ Instructor , for a whole night we toiled and took nothing , but at your bidding I will lower the nets . ”
Peter felt an unexpected weight as he started hauling in the nets .
From now on you will be catching men alive . ” This was no time for doubt or fear .
Peter put faith in Jesus and the One who sent him .
Christians today who overcome their doubt and fear to take up service to God are likewise showing faith .
Such trust in Jehovah is never misplaced . ​ — Psalm 22 : 4 , 5 .
Was it the spray of the waves catching the moonlight ?
No , it was too steady , too upright .
As the figure neared , it looked as though he was going to walk right by them .
Terrified , the disciples thought it was some kind of apparition .
Kindly , Jesus beckoned him .
And Jesus was doing so in response to Peter’s faith in him .
He cried out : “ Lord , save me ! ”
Doubt can be a powerful , destructive force .
How ?
By keeping the right focus .
Quiet fell on the Sea of Galilee .
Do you have such determination ?
Would You Welcome a Visit ?
Even in this troubled world , you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God , his Kingdom , and his wonderful purpose for mankind .

Maintaining Friendships in a Loveless World
SONGS TO BE USED : 173 , 155
What does it mean to be a good friend ?
Family Worship ​ — Vital for Survival !
Have You Set Aside Time for Bible Study ?
JEHOVAH appreciates willing sacrifices made by his servants to express their love for him and their submission to his will .
As Christians , what kind of life do we lead , and what does this involve ?
In chapter 12 , Paul explains that Christians should show their gratitude by a life of self - sacrifice .
Such a complete change can be brought about only with the help of God and his spirit .
How should Christian elders use their gifts ?
Some of the gifts Paul mentions ​ — exhorting , presiding — ​ especially concern Christian elders , who are admonished to preside “ in real earnest . ”
What does such a ministry involve ?
Christian elders use their gifts to build up the members of the congregation .
They show themselves to “ be at this ministry ” when they earnestly provide guidance and instruction to the congregation from God’s Word by their prayerful study , research , teaching , and shepherding .
Be aglow with the spirit .
Likewise , it can move us to be zealous in the ministry , to “ be aglow with the spirit . ”
Humility and Modesty
Read Romans 12 : 3 , 16 .
Rather , we want to “ think so as to have a sound mind . ”
How can we avoid being “ discreet in [ our ] own eyes ” ?
It is “ God who makes it grow . ”
Why does Paul compare spirit - begotten Christians to members of a body ?
Paul states that Jehovah “ subjected all things under [ Christ’s ] feet , and made him head over all things to the congregation . ”
Today , the other sheep are part of “ all things ” placed by Jehovah under the headship of his Son .
Such unity is based on love , the “ perfect bond of union . ”
Of course , we must not confuse love with sentimentality .
We should do all we can to keep the congregation clean .
Our love for our brothers will move us to “ share with the holy ones according to their needs ” and according to our ability .
Although poor themselves , Christians in Macedonia were very generous .
He shared their joy .
Often , we can bring much relief to fellow believers who are suffering emotional pain if we take the time to listen to them with a truly sympathetic ear .
Elders , in particular , should follow the counsel that Paul gives on showing empathy .
• How do we demonstrate that we are “ aglow with the spirit ” ?
[ Picture on page 6 ]
12 : 18 .
( b ) Where can we find counsel on how to react to opposition ?
The apostle Paul experienced the truthfulness of Jesus ’ words .
3 , 4 .
Paul explained that when faced with hostility , we should not retaliate in kind .
On the contrary , such an attitude can only aggravate the situation .
She insisted that I play boules ( a French bowling game ) with him even though it was not my favorite game .
As to providing “ fine things in the sight of all men , ” Jehovah’s Witnesses have often overcome prejudice by providing practical assistance to their neighbors when a disaster strikes .
Read Romans 12 : 20 .
Like “ fiery coals , ” acts of kindness can warm the hearts of opposers and perhaps melt down their hostility .
Genuine Christians are peace lovers and peacemakers . ​ — Matt . 5 : 9 , ftn .
One way to be a peacemaker within the family circle is to settle disagreements as quickly as possible rather than allow situations to deteriorate .
The apostle Peter links the pursuit of peace with restraint of the tongue .
3 : 17 , 18 .
While trying to be “ peaceable with all men , ” what should we keep in mind ?
That includes neighbors , fellow employees , schoolmates , and people we meet in our public ministry .
That means doing all we reasonably can to be “ peaceable with all ” but not to the extent of compromising God’s righteous principles .
Earlier in his letter to the Romans , Paul stated : “ God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way . ”
We know that this Christian activity will provoke the anger of our enemies , for Jesus warned us : “ You will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name . ”
What has Romans chapter 12 taught us about ( a ) how we should use our lives ?
Our brief consideration of chapter 12 of Paul’s letter to the Christians in Rome has reminded us of many things .
This applies in the family circle , within the congregation , with neighbors , at work , at school , and in our public ministry .
Even when faced with outright hostility , we do our best to conquer evil with good , remembering that vengeance belongs to Jehovah .
Read Romans 12 : 12 .
This will enable us to follow his further counsel to “ endure under tribulation . ”
Finally , we need to keep our minds fixed on the future that Jehovah holds in store for us and to “ rejoice in the hope ” of everlasting life , be it in heaven or on earth .
• Why should we not seek to avenge ourselves ?
The brothers Peter and Andrew had been fishermen .
Matthew was formerly a tax collector ​ — a member of a profession that was despised by the Jews .
Our friendship with him is of utmost importance because being his friends makes us friends of Jehovah too .
( Read John 14 : 6 , 21 . )
What , then , must we do to become and remain friends of Jesus ?
Jesus ’ Example of Being a Good Friend
For what was Jesus known ?
That observation sums up the tendency of imperfect humans to form friendships based on what they can receive rather than on what they can give .
Jesus was known , not for his connections to the wealthy and prominent , but for befriending the lowly and despised . ​ — Matt .
Certainly , Jesus ’ friends were flawed individuals .
Peter on occasion failed to view matters from a spiritual perspective .
Rather , he chose to focus on their good intentions and positive qualities .
Even though Judas maintained the outward appearance of friendship , Jesus detected that this former close companion had allowed his heart to be corrupted .
Because Judas had become a friend of the world , he had made himself an enemy of God .
How did Jesus express his love for his friends ?
16 : 13 - 16 ; 17 : 24 - 26 .
But Jesus gave his life as an expression of love .
“ No one has love greater than this , ” said Jesus , “ that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends . ” ​ — John 15 : 13 .
How Did the Disciples Respond to Jesus ’ Friendship ?
How did people react to Jesus ’ generosity ?
Rather than give Jesus the benefit of the doubt , they jumped to a wrong conclusion and turned their backs on him .
On his final night as a human on earth , Jesus expressed his appreciation to his friends , saying : “ You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 28 .
Briefly , they allowed fear of man to overwhelm their love for Christ .
Again , Jesus forgave them .
The disciples poured their hearts and souls into spreading the Kingdom message .
For many , this meant making big changes in their conduct and personality .
They put away their old personality and put on the new .
2 : 16 .
Jesus called those who would make up the faithful slave class his brothers .
Let us consider just three ways .
However , the remaining ones of Christ’s brothers on earth today would be hard - pressed to shoulder that responsibility without the assistance of their other sheep companions .
Really , each time members of the other sheep class engage in the preaching work , they help Christ’s brothers to fulfill their sacred commission .
9 : 7 .
Therefore , the way we react to their authority directly influences our friendship with Christ .
19 , 20 .
Jesus continues to care for us not only through the oversight of loving shepherds but also by providing us with spiritual mothers and brothers and sisters within the congregation .
( Read Mark 10 : 29 , 30 . )
When you first began associating with Jehovah’s organization , how did your relatives react ?
But Jesus warned that sometimes “ a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household . ”
How Would You Answer ?
• What example did Jesus set in being a good friend ?
• How can we prove ourselves to be friends of Christ ?
How can we demonstrate our desire to be friends of Christ ?
DURING his final night on earth , Jesus encouraged his loyal disciples to remain friends with one another .
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
However , during these last days , people in general are disloyal and fail to show natural affection .
The friendships they do form are often shallow and self - serving .
Let us , then , consider the following : What is the foundation of good friendships ?
The strongest friendships are founded on a love for Jehovah .
Why was the friendship between Ruth and Naomi so enduring ?
Why was their friendship so enduring ?
Ruth revealed the reason when she said to Naomi : “ Your people will be my people , and your God my God . . . .
The example of Ruth and Naomi demonstrates that good friendships are not formed by accident .
The apostle Paul encouraged his friends in the congregation in Rome to “ follow the course of hospitality . ”
Following a literal course involves taking a series of steps , one after the other . Likewise , being hospitable involves taking a series of small , regular actions .
Nobody else can walk the path of hospitality for you .
9 , 10 .
What example did Paul set , and how may we imitate him ?
The apostle Paul set a good example in widening out in his affections .
For instance , he and Timothy became close friends despite a difference in age and background .
“ I have a very dear friend who is in her 50 ’ s , ” says Vanessa , who is in her early 20 ’ s .
And she cares about me so much . ”
How are such friendships formed ?
When composing those words , Solomon may have had in mind the friendship that his father , David , enjoyed with Jonathan .
What challenge do some Bible students face , and how can we assist them ?
Now , though , he sees that their activities could have a bad influence on him , and he feels the need to limit his contact with such companions .
When Bible students are abandoned by former friends who have no love for God , members of the congregation can fill the void .
I then began to reassess my own motives .
The sister quoted earlier sums up the matter : “ I learned that we cannot make someone love Jehovah or love us .
Ultimately , it is a personal choice . ”
Do you view the comments as an act of loving - kindness , or do you take offense ?
He likely knew some of those men when they first became believers .
Paul’s friends were not offended .
Good friends not only accept wise counsel but also give it .
What will all of us do at times , but why is it vital that we maintain strong friendships in the congregation ?
However , the measure of a friendship is not how often we sin against each other but how completely we forgive those grievances .
If we display such love , it will become “ a perfect bond of union . ”
How Would You Answer ?
That a man should prepare properly before he gets married and starts his own family , recognizing the responsibilities that come with such a commitment .
Consider two reasons .
The word rendered “ build up ” may also be figurative , in the sense of building , or establishing , a household ​ — that is , marrying and having children .
God’s Word indicates that a man who does not care for the physical , emotional , and spiritual needs of his family is worse than one without faith !
So a young man who seeks a wife should think carefully about the principle found at Proverbs 24 : 27 .
[ Blurb on page 12 ]
HAVE you ever been so touched by something you heard at one of our conventions that it moved you to make big changes in your life ?
However , before I tell you about those changes , let me fill you in on some events that took place years before these conventions were held ​ — events related to my childhood .
Though we were poor , Mother was generous .
Whenever she found the means to prepare a special meal , she shared it with neighbors .
One day , a neighbor who often spoke kindly to me asked me to accompany her sons to their church’s Sunday school .
At school , fear of man likewise led me to act against my conscience .
We called him Big Ben ​ — and for good reason .
To me , he looked as tall and as wide as our front door .
When I was down , he talked to me in the way a caring older brother would speak to his younger sibling .
Louis .
Still , they welcomed us .
Our hosts said that they were not going to break their promise of providing a room .
I did too .
I was fired up .
He related that once while he was in the preaching work , an angry mob had beaten him and had covered him with tar and feathers .
When we left that brother , I felt like David .
Back in school , I approached the principal .
He glared at me .
His face was red with anger .
I also saw the graduation of a Gilead class , which made me think , ‘ If these Witnesses of my age group can forgo material comforts to serve abroad , I should be willing to do the same here at home . ’
By the end of the convention , I had made up my mind to become a pioneer .
She loved to do street work in front of a huge Roman Catholic Church .
29 : 25 .
Then we spotted a run - down trailer .
Moreover , the brothers in the congregation at times left a big fish on the steps of the trailer .
Their excitement was contagious .
Look after them ! ”
After learning Portuguese , I was assigned to do circuit work in Rio Grande do Sul , a state in southern Brazil .
Congregations were scattered over a vast rural area , and some could be reached only by truck .
Their low wages allowed them to eat only once a day .
Living among them , we received an education that no school can offer .
While caring for Mother , we pioneered and took on cleaning jobs .
Can you imagine our joy as we embraced ?
Are You “ Rooted and Established on the Foundation ” ?
God’s Word states that “ Christ Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone ” of the Christian congregation .
Jehovah wants us “ to grasp mentally with all the holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth ” of the truth .
2 : 1 - 5 .
After all , Satan himself knows what the Bible contains .
Right now , why not test your own understanding of a few of the vital truths found in the Bible ?
As an example , read the opening verses of the apostle Paul’s letter to the Ephesians .
Paul wrote to fellow believers : “ [ God ] foreordained us to the adoption through Jesus Christ as sons to himself . ”
14 : 3 , 4 .
Why did Paul state that the arrangements considered in the opening verses of Ephesians came about “ according to the riches of [ God’s ] undeserved kindness ” ?
However , there can also be no doubt that man’s current hurried lifestyle makes it easy for Satan to weaken ​ — if not destroy — ​ such habits .
Do not allow him to do that to you .
Use the “ intellectual capacity ” that God has given you to become “ full - grown in powers of understanding . ”
“ To the Ephesians ”
In vivid figures of speech , the prophet Micah wrote : “ The mountains must melt . . . , and the low plains themselves will split apart , like wax because of the fire , like waters being poured down a steep place . ”
24 : 21 .
2 : 12 .
As the months go by , do not allow a hit - or - miss attitude to creep in .
Remember , your children are your most important Bible students .
Strive to make it practical .
Young ones enjoy doing things that they do well .
Rehearsing presentations and thinking of ways to handle objections will help them to become more confident as they engage in various forms of the Kingdom - preaching work . ​ — 2 Tim .
2 : 15 .
The “ Peer - Pressure Planner ” on pages 132 and 133 provides suggestions and also allows opportunities for your child to create responses that he or she feels comfortable with . A statement at the bottom of page 133 encourages youths : “ Rehearse your responses with a parent or a mature friend . ”
In this regard , Young People Ask , Volume 2 , has excellent information in chapter 38 , entitled “ What Will I Do With My Life ? ”
Always remember that your son or daughter must come to love Jehovah with his or her own heart ​ — not yours .
Then let your child’s heart respond to Jehovah’s goodness .
The questions in that box can be used as an outline for family discussion .
Be careful , though , not to turn the family study into an interrogation session .
[ Picture on page 30 ]
LAST year , the Governing Body announced an adjustment to the congregation meeting schedule that allows more time for Bible study and discussion as a family .
For example , Kevin , an elder , wrote : “ The words ‘ thank you ’ are not strong enough to express how we in the congregation feel .
Jodi , whose husband is an elder , wrote : “ We have three daughters , aged 15 , 11 , and 2 .
We recently moved to a sign - language congregation .
His example helped me to see more clearly what it means to be a true friend .
I really look forward to discovering many more of such gems on Tuesday nights ! ”
“ Perhaps there may be someone who will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men . ” ​ — Colossians 2 : 8 .
However , the adoption of one myth led to the creation of others and produced what is now commonly believed to be Christian doctrine .
The Hebrew word neʹphesh , translated “ soul , ” means ‘ a creature that breathes . ’
Therefore , “ soul ” in the Biblical sense refers to the entire living being .
“ Of all classical Greek philosophers , the one who has had the greatest influence on traditional views of Hell is Plato . ” ​ — Histoire des enfers ( The History of Hell ) , by Georges Minois , page 50 .
Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell , where they suffer the punishments of hell , ‘ eternal fire . ’
Compare these Bible verses : Psalm 146 : 3 , 4 ; Acts 2 : 25 - 27 ; Romans 6 : 7 , 23
God does not punish people in hell


With what result ?
Compare these Bible verses : Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 ; John 17 : 3 ; 2 Timothy 2 : 11 , 12
‘ Look !
I can see heaven thrown open , ’ he said , ‘ and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God . ’ ” ​ — Acts 7 : 55 , 56 , The New Jerusalem Bible .
What did this vision reveal ?
There is no mention of a third person next to God in this account .
Compare these Bible verses : Matthew 26 : 39 ; John 14 : 28 ; 1 Corinthians 15 : 27 , 28 ; Colossians 1 : 15 , 16
The Trinitarian dogma is a late fourth - century invention

And so the child will be holy and will be called Son of God . ” ​ — Italics ours ; Luke 1 : 31 - 35 , The New Jerusalem Bible .
By proclaiming her Theotokos ( a Greek word meaning “ God - bearer ” ) , or “ Mother of God , ” the Council of Ephesus , in 431 C.E . , set the stage for Mary worship .
Compare these Bible verses : Matthew 13 : 53 - 56 ; Mark 3 : 31 - 35 ; Luke 11 : 27 , 28
Mary was the mother of the Son of God , not of God himself .
“ At first , ” states The Encyclopedia of Religion , “ images may have served primarily didactic [ teaching ] and decorative purposes ; at least , they were defended on such grounds .
This was especially true of the icons that became a prominent feature of Eastern Orthodoxy . ”
What image can you contrive of him ? ” ​ — Isaiah 40 : 18 , The New Jerusalem Bible .
Then , this promise will prove true in your case : “ You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ” ​ — John 8 : 32 .
But he never talks to me about our bills .

Is our happiness as a couple over ? ’
Consider the following three suggestions .
Because , explains verse 10 , “ if one of them should fall , the other one can raise his partner up . ”
If so , this can boost your feelings of self - worth and may contribute to your mate’s ability to continue providing care .
However , it may seem impossible to maintain a balanced schedule , given the disrupting effect that a chronic sickness can have on a family’s routine .
Can you still enjoy some of the things you shared before illness struck ?
At times , balance becomes a problem for caregiving spouses .
Eventually , they may even render themselves unable to continue providing care for their beloved mate .
So if you are taking care of a chronically ill spouse , do not ignore your personal needs .
TRY THIS : List on paper the obstacles you face in taking care of your mate .
Then make a list of steps you might take to overcome these or to cope with them more effectively .
The key here is to accept your situation and make the best of it .
What can help you and your mate in this regard ?
At one point after Akiko was diagnosed with fibromyalgia , they had to leave a special assignment in the full - time Christian ministry .
Such practical advice can help you too if your spouse has special needs .

About Family Life
What view of marriage makes families happy ?
Therefore , what God has yoked together let no man put apart . . . .
Whoever divorces his wife , except on the ground of fornication , and marries another commits adultery . ”
Husbands make their wives happy when they follow Jesus ’ example .
He was self - sacrificing in his love for his figurative wife , the congregation .
Jesus was never dictatorial or harsh with those under his care but was refreshing to them .
Husbands , therefore , should exercise their authority in a kind way that benefits all in the family .
“ The head of the Christ is God , ” says the Bible .
Jesus did not consider it beneath him to be in subjection to God .
He had deep respect for his Father .
Jesus spent time with children and was interested in their thoughts and feelings .
The Bible says : “ Jesus called the infants to him , saying : ‘ Let the young children come to me . ’ ”
With what effect ?
“ All those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers . ”

The dangers of an independent spirit .
Is that the case ?
Jehovah wants us to make the right choices , and his Word , the Bible , tells us how we can do that .
They are also knowable .
We do not have to ascend “ into the heavens ” or journey “ to the other side of the sea ” in order to learn what God expects of us .
We are free to choose between life and death , good and bad .

Treasure Your Place in the Congregation
January 18 - 24 , 2010
The second is likely to help you find ways you can enrich your prayers because it encourages careful examination of petitions and expressions of praise and thankfulness recorded in the Bible .
These articles show how we can strengthen these two aspects of our lives .

Cherish Your Deaf Brothers and Sisters !
1 , 2 .
Why can Jehovah’s servants confidently turn to him in prayer ?
We might well ask ourselves : ‘ Do my supplications show that I trust in Jehovah and that pure worship is of prime concern to me ?
What do my prayers say about me ? ’
If our prayers are to be answered , we must approach God with humility .
But what relief confession to God brought him !
If anxiety has a grip on us for any reason , we should apply Paul’s counsel : “ Do not be anxious over anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God . ”
“ To supplicate ” means “ to make a humble entreaty . ”
If we prayed only when we needed something , however , what would that reveal about our motives ?
29 : 11 - 13 .
107 : 15 ; 119 : 62 , 105 .
8 , 9 .
Though the apostle Paul may not have known all the believers in Colossae , he wrote : “ We thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ always when we pray for you , since we heard of your faith in connection with Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones . ”
Paul also prayed for Christians in Thessalonica .
Prayers of that kind say much about us and how we view our brothers and sisters in the faith .
Prayers of this kind are upbuilding and promote unity with our brothers .
We can ask that others pray for us , even as the apostle Paul did .
13 : 18 .
Are our supplications focused chiefly on compliance with God’s will , the preaching of the Kingdom message , the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty , and the sanctification of his name ?
6 : 9 , 10 .
Our prayers to God reveal our motives , interests , and desires .
I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite ; I will take refuge in the concealment of your wings . ”
15 , 16 .
Prayer may help us to discern what about our desire to reach out for service privileges ?
These sisters may work along with the feelings they express in their private prayers by striving to conduct themselves in an exemplary manner .
Why is solitude desirable when we pray privately ?
Jesus often withdrew from the crowds in order to pray to his Father privately .
There is nothing shocking or tactless about Jesus ’ model prayer .
How should we comport ourselves during public prayer ?
6 : 3 .
God knows us and the meaning of the things he caused his spirit to speak through the Bible writers .
As we have noted , our prayers do say much about us .
In the next article , we will examine some prayers and prayerful expressions recorded in the Bible .
Do you regularly praise and thank Jehovah ?
1 , 2 .
3 , 4 .
Bible study makes it evident that you should always pray for God’s guidance .
If so , Jacob’s entreaty may remind you that prayers can allay anxiety .
( Read 1 Kings 3 : 7 - 14 . )
If you receive service privileges that seem overwhelming , pray for wisdom and display a humble spirit .
Consider the patience of an exiled Levite .
Wait for God , for I shall yet laud him as the grand salvation of my person and as my God . ” ​ — Ps .
42 : 5 , 11 ; 43 : 5 .
Hannah , one of the Levite Elkanah’s two wives , prayed and acted in faith .
16 , 17 .
He pleaded : “ Ah , Jehovah , please , let your ear become attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name ; and , please , do grant success to your servant today and make him an object of pity before this man . ”
1 : 11 .
There are so many reasons to do so !
Do be exalted above the heavens , O God ; let your glory be above all the earth . ”
How did Mary express her devotion to God ?
Do your prayers give evidence of such reverence and faith ?
They should .
Because of persecution or other trials , prayer often includes pleas for help to serve Jehovah with courage .
When the Sanhedrin ordered Peter and John to stop ‘ teaching upon the basis of Jesus ’ name , ’ those apostles courageously refused to quit .
Then all those present petitioned God for help in speaking his word with boldness .
23 , 24 . ( a ) Cite other examples showing how Bible study can enrich your prayers . ( b ) What will you do to enrich your prayers ?
Many other examples could be cited to show that Bible reading and study can enrich your prayers .
If you are seeking a marriage mate , studying the prayer found in Ezra chapter 9 , coupled with personal entreaty , can strengthen your determination to obey God by ‘ marrying only in the Lord . ’ ​ — 1 Cor .
Keep on reading , studying , and searching the Bible .
Keep Growing in Brotherly Love
“ Go on walking in love , just as the Christ also loved you . ” ​ — EPH .
5 : 2 .
Still , Christ Jesus chose a different facet of Christianity to identify his genuine disciples .
When one of Jehovah’s Witnesses invited him to a meeting , Marcelino hesitated .
He did not want to face more rejection .
He was warmly welcomed , and he gained comfort from the Bible teachings he heard .
Appealing as it is , our brotherly love cannot be taken for granted .
Think of a campfire burning at night , drawing people to its warm , flickering flames .
How can we do so ?
“ You , Too , Widen Out ”
5 , 6 .
Why did Paul urge the Corinthian Christians to “ widen out ” ?
Paul came to Corinth in the fall of 50 C.E .
However , some in the congregation drew away from him .
The Greek word there rendered “ welcome ” means “ to receive kindly or hospitably , admit to one’s society and friendship . ”
As we greet our brothers at the Kingdom Hall and other places , we can pay attention to those whom we have not seen or with whom we have not spoken recently .
At the next meeting , we can do the same with others .
Greeting others is the first step in welcoming them .
It is a step that can lead to enjoyable discussions and lasting friendships .
Consider how Jesus responded when his disciples tried to prevent parents from bringing their children to him .
Then “ he took the children into his arms and began blessing them , laying his hands upon them . ”
Each Christian should ask himself , ‘ Do I make myself available to others or do I often appear to be too busy ? ’
Some might say , “ I prefer to keep to myself ” or “ I don’t feel like talking in the morning . ”
Nonetheless , engaging in friendly conversation even when we are not inclined to do so is evidence of love that “ does not look for its own interests . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
Paul encouraged young Timothy to have respect for all members of the congregation .
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 1 , 2 . )
Now he tries to imitate them by conversing with his fellow Bethelites .
Humility Helps Us to Make Peace
Euodia and Syntyche , two Christian sisters in ancient Philippi , apparently had some difficulty in resolving a problem that arose between them .
These accounts show that true worshippers are not immune to disagreements .
Twenty years had passed since Esau became bitter over losing his birthright to his twin brother , Jacob , and wanted to kill him .
He “ proceeded to bow down to the earth ” as he approached his brother .
The danger of a fight was averted .
What lesson can we learn from Jesus ’ washing the feet of his apostles ?
Yes , genuine brotherly love should move us to display care and concern for all our Christian brothers and sisters .
Do You Remember ?
Displaying Good Manners as Ministers of God
To understand what displaying good manners entails , consider the examples of Jehovah God and his Son .
As Christians , we follow Jesus ’ example by being kind and helpful .
Moreover , such conduct glorifies Jehovah and brings us happiness .
What example of warmth and friendliness did Jesus set ?
They viewed those who did not know the Law as “ accursed people ” and treated them as such .
The gracious way that God and his Son treat people of all nations and ethnic groups dignifies such individuals and attracts those rightly disposed to the truth .
Greeting People and Talking to Them
Of course , no one is expected to speak to everyone passing by on a crowded sidewalk .
Jesus gave us a reminder when he said : “ If you greet your brothers only , what extraordinary thing are you doing ?
In this regard , consultant Donald Weiss wrote : “ People resent it when others look through or past them .
There’s really no excuse you can make that will appease those who have been ignored .
We approach those we see outside their homes and those who work in the area .
We smile and greet them .
Showing Courtesy in Difficult Circumstances
We expect this , for Christ Jesus forewarned his disciples : “ If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . ”
Paul recommended : “ Let your utterance be always with graciousness , seasoned with salt , so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one . ”
Displaying good manners in difficult situations brings good results .
When the brother approached him , the man said : “ I’m sorry about what happened .
What do I have to do to be like that ? ”
Consider the polite way in which Abraham and his son Isaac addressed each other at Genesis 22 : 7 .
When imprisoned , he was courteous even to his fellow prisoners .
16 - 18 . ( a ) What can be done to teach children good manners ?
The value of training our children to be well - mannered cannot be overestimated .
At the Kingdom Hall , Dad would take me with him before and after the meetings to speak to the older brothers and sisters .
Kurt goes on to say : “ In time , his manners became mine .
Treating people with courtesy becomes automatic .
It is not the way you have to act , but the way you want to act . ”
But the Devil will fail to eradicate the good manners of true Christians .
Do You Recall ?
Many people hesitate to start a conversation with someone they do not know .
Think about these words in this way : If you have never met a certain person before , he views you as a stranger .
He says that even though each member serves a different function , all are necessary .
How , then , can we find our place within God’s arrangement and treasure , or cherish , it ?
And how can we make ‘ our advancement manifest to all persons ’ ? ​ — 1 Tim .
4 : 15 .
What is one way to find our place in the congregation and show that we treasure it ?
Over the years , for example , we have received pointed direction on dress and grooming , entertainment , and improper use of the Internet .
What about the admonition to establish a regular routine of family worship ?
Consideration must especially be given to Jehovah’s viewpoint as revealed through his Word , the Bible .
Surely we do not want to be like Diotrephes , who would not ‘ receive anything from the apostle John with respect . ’
And should we not strive to be obedient and submissive to those taking the lead in our local congregation ? ​ — Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 .
Others serve in such special forms of full - time service as missionaries , traveling overseers , and members of Bethel families throughout the world .
The great majority of Jehovah’s people are doing their best to care for the spiritual needs of their families and have a full share in the ministry each week .
We can be confident that when we offer ourselves willingly in God’s service and do our best to serve him whole - souled , there is always a place for us in his arrangement .
For example , the place a brother occupies in the congregation differs in some respects from that of a sister .
“ The beauty of young men is their power , ” states Proverbs 20 : 29 , “ and the splendor of old men is their gray - headedness . ”
Younger members of the congregation may be able to do more physically because of their youthful energy , whereas older ones benefit the congregation greatly because of their wisdom and experience .
What bearing does desire have on what we do in the congregation ?
Both graduate from high school .
It was desire .
Make me walk in your truth and teach me , for you are my God of salvation .
( b ) How can a brother reach out for service privileges ?
How can a brother strive to meet such Scriptural requirements ?
What can young brothers , especially those in their teens , do to make advancement in the congregation ?
Sisters too can demonstrate that they treasure their privilege of personally participating in the fulfillment of Psalm 68 : 11 .
I study about how Jehovah views me .
Keep Your Place !
Accepting this invitation was the best decision we ever made .
“ Jehovah , I have loved the dwelling of your house , ” said the psalmist .
• Why is it reasonable to conclude that all Christians have a place in the congregation ?
• What factors can affect our place in the congregation ?
How can sisters demonstrate that they treasure their place in the congregation ?
This is in harmony with the principle stated by the apostle Paul that “ every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head ” because “ the head of a woman is the man . ”
*
What , though , of situations in which a sister interprets into sign language for a brother who is delivering a discourse ?
Also , unlike sign - language interpretation , sisters who interpret spoken languages are usually not situated so prominently .
In view of this , it may be more practical to wear a head covering during the entire meeting .
RECENTLY , on her own initiative , a nine - year - old girl in Brazil separated the money she had saved into two parts ​ — 18 dollars and 25 dollars .
My desire is to help many brothers and sisters around the world to preach the good news .
I am giving it with great affection and love for Jehovah . ”
They have also impressed upon her the need to ‘ honor Jehovah with her valuable things . ’

Jewelry or other valuables may be donated as well .
Money may be placed in trust with Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for use worldwide .
In exchange , the donor , or someone designated by the donor , receives a specified annuity payment every year for life .
A trust benefiting a religious organization may provide certain tax advantages . As the term “ charitable planning ” implies , these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor .
The brochure was written to provide information on a variety of ways that gifts may be made either now or through a bequest at death .
They may tell you how they felt when they first learned that God has a name ​ — how that single truth changed their life and sustained them for years before sign - language video programs or DVDs became available to help them learn deeper Scriptural truths .
Older deaf Witnesses remember what it was like to engage in the “ hearing ” field ministry .
In one hand , they held up an index card with a simple door - to - door presentation written on it .
They would hold the latest Watchtower and Awake !
Why ?
There is also the example of Richard , a brother in his 70 ’ s who is both deaf and blind and who lives in Brooklyn , New York , U.S.A .
All in the congregation were notified , but somehow Richard was not informed .
When the brothers realized what had happened and searched for him , they found Richard standing outside the Kingdom Hall , waiting patiently for the doors to open .
You may meet a deaf person informally or in the ministry .
Although there may be other hearing publishers in your congregation , why not “ turn off ” your voice ?
This will help you to think in sign language , that is , visually .
“ Every day , people all around me speak , ” said one deaf brother .
“ Often feelings of loneliness and being left out build up inside , and I become exasperated , even angry .
Words cannot fully describe how I feel at times . ”
Not to be overlooked are the many smaller groups of deaf individuals that meet together with hearing congregations .
What can you do to show these deaf brothers personal attention ?
We can learn a lot from our deaf brothers and sisters . ”
Their example of faith and endurance certainly adds to the richness of Jehovah’s organization .

The following articles will answer these questions : How can we be sure that God really cares about us ?
What will God do to end suffering , and when ?
Consider also the way we are made .
Who does not enjoy the warm companionship of good friends or the embrace of someone for whom we have deep affection ?
Why , the ability to love is itself a gift from a God who loves !
Not only is his love manifest in creation but it is also evident in his Word , the Bible .
The ability to love is a gift from a God who loves
SUFFERING is seen everywhere , and many are those who respond to it compassionately .
Medical personnel , for example , work long shifts in hospitals to help those who are ill or injured .
Assurance is found in the last book of the Bible : “ [ God ] will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore .
The former things have passed away . ” Consider the scope of that promise .
That Kingdom will do away with every human government .
Long ago , the Bible foretold : “ The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin . And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people .
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ”
Recall that Jehovah gave his Son as a ransom so that humans might receive everlasting life .

Jehovah replied : “ The vision is yet for the appointed time . . . It will not be late . ”

Draw Close to God
Jehovah , our heavenly Father , likewise wants his earthly children to succeed .
By applying it , we too can succeed . ​ — Romans 15 : 4 .
How , though , can he summon these noble qualities ?
At the time , Joshua likely has just a few books of the Bible in written form .
In order to benefit from it , Joshua needs to do two things .
Reading and meditating on God’s Word each day will help Joshua to handle the challenges that lie ahead .
Jehovah wants you to succeed .
One longtime faithful Christian suggested : “ Get that Bible off its printed page , and get it into your heart . ”

Let’s talk about how Jeremiah was someone special to God , yet even he felt like quitting .
Why not ?
Let’s see how Jeremiah was protected because he did not quit .
Jehovah told Jeremiah to warn the people that Jerusalem would be destroyed if they did not change their bad ways .
Then he said : ‘ You should know that if you put me to death , you are killing an innocent man , for God sent me to speak to you . ’
Why was Jeremiah protected , but Urijah was not ?

“ Ponder over these things ; be absorbed in them , that your advancement may be manifest to all persons . ” ​ — 1 TIM .
There , several Christian congregations were established in the decades after Jesus ’ death .
Young Timothy must have displayed a maturity beyond his years .
Then , under the direction of the holy spirit , Paul and the local body of elders laid their hands upon Timothy , setting him apart for special work in the congregation . ​ — 1 Tim .
4 : 14 ; 2 Tim .
Imagine how surprised and excited Timothy must have been !
About the time when Paul wrote to the Philippians , he entrusted Timothy with a weighty responsibility ​ — that of appointing elders and ministerial servants .
5 , 6 .
( Read 1 Timothy 4 : 11 - 16 . )
This is the kind of advancement that every Christian should want to manifest .
What is expected of all in the congregation ?
Others engage in the pioneer service .
Elders share in various teaching programs , such as at assemblies and conventions .
Become an Example in Speaking
What impact does our speech have on our worship ?
Our speech can reveal to others in the congregation the degree to which we have progressed spiritually .
Why is faith without hypocrisy vital to our spiritual advancement ?
Still , Timothy needed to make his genuineness as a Christian manifest to others .
Paul mentioned to Timothy how important it was for Christian women to “ adorn themselves in well - arranged dress , with modesty and soundness of mind . ”
Like Timothy , how can we be examples in chasteness ?
Timothy was to be exemplary also in chasteness .
But it is also true that a Christian’s fine works cannot be kept hidden .
12 : 10 .
Could Timothy risk toying with the harmful ideas that were infiltrating the congregation ?
The following article will discuss how we can cultivate and maintain joy during troublesome times .
How Would You Answer ?
• Why are Christians to be exemplary in love and faith ?
[ Picture on page 11 ]
Young Timothy displayed maturity beyond his years
5 : 11 .
Yes , like Jesus , his disciples are hated and persecuted .
( Read Isaiah 65 : 13 , 14 . )
He lacks nothing and needs no one .
The Bible describes one such situation with the words : “ How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness , they would make him feel hurt in the desert !
Granted , we cannot compare ourselves to Jehovah when it comes to our ability to solve problems .
She was mocked and taunted on account of her barrenness .
At times , Hannah was so discouraged that she would weep and not eat .
During one of her visits to Jehovah’s sanctuary , Hannah became “ bitter of soul , and she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep greatly . ”
She then “ proceeded to go on her way and to eat , and her face became self - concerned no more . ” ​ — 1 Sam .
How often did Paul entreat Jehovah about the matter ?
Paul accepted this fact and concentrated on serving Jehovah fully . ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 12 : 8 - 10 .
Yes , Jehovah may not take away our problem , but he can respond to our prayers by guarding our mental powers .
What are some activities that can help dispel discouragement and give us a measure of joy ?
On the other hand , a positive perspective will help us to focus on aspects of our lives from which we can derive delight and joy .
3 : 17 , 18 .
Furthermore , a breathtaking sunset , a majestic landscape , the antics of young animals , and other wonders of nature cost nothing , yet they can fill us with awe and bring us joy .
When problems arise , may thinking ability and practical wisdom guide us .
Let us find delight in the good things that come from him , both physical and spiritual .
Jehovah is distressed by the bad things that are happening
( b ) Why do we say that we have more evidence of Jesus ’ Messiahship than did first - century Christians ?
“ WE HAVE found the Messiah , ” Andrew told his brother Peter , convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was God’s Anointed One .
( Read John 20 : 30 , 31 . )
What , then , would be the likelihood that all the prophecies about the Messiah might be fulfilled by coincidence in one person ?
One researcher said that the odds that a person could fulfill all the Messianic prophecies by chance would be “ so astronomical ” that it must be ruled out .
However , by God’s permission , Satan would first inflict a symbolic heel wound on the woman’s “ seed . ”
Jesus ’ Credentials as the Messiah
In what way did Jesus come forth from God’s “ woman ” ?
How was Jesus fulfilling Messianic prophecy when he presented himself for water baptism ?
Jesus was properly hailed as King , but that his rule would be future and from heaven would only later be fully understood .
Listening to the Messiah
In heaven , God’s only - begotten Son was a mighty spirit person .
Confirming Jesus ’ Messiahship during the transfiguration , Jehovah directed : “ Listen to him . ”
Yes , listen to , or obey , this Chosen One .
11 , 12 . ( a ) The first - century Jews rejected Jesus as the Messiah for what reasons ?
But they remained loyal , and in time , accurate understanding was given them . ​ — Luke 24 : 21 .
Entry into the Kingdom would require ‘ disowning oneself , ’ ‘ eating ’ Jesus ’ flesh and blood , being “ born again , ” and being “ no part of the world . ”
Why the Messiah Had to Die
First , Jesus ’ faithfulness unto death resolved an important aspect of the “ sacred secret . ”
He proved to the ultimate degree that a perfect man can maintain “ godly devotion ” and uphold God’s sovereignty despite the severest of tests imposed by Satan .
Completing His Role as the Messiah
Throughout the centuries since his resurrection , Jesus has faithfully supervised the activities of the Christian congregation over which he has been ruling as King .
After the final test , all rebels , including Satan and his demons , will be “ hurled into the lake of fire , ” the crushing death blow to the head of the “ serpent . ” ​ — Rev .
Jehovah’s sacred name will have been cleared of all reproach , and the rightfulness of his universal sovereignty fully vindicated .
What a grand heritage lies just ahead for all who obey God’s Anointed One !
Since 1914 we have been living in the period of Christ’s pa·rou·siʹa , or presence .
Nevertheless , just like the first - century Jews , most people today ignore the evidence of the Messiah’s presence .
They too want a political messiah or at least one who will work through human political rulers .
You , though , came to know that Jesus is now reigning as King of God’s Kingdom .
Just like the first - century disciples , you were moved to proclaim : “ We have found the Messiah . ”
Why not approach them with renewed zeal and show them that Jesus Christ is indeed the promised Messiah , God’s means of salvation ?
• What will Jesus yet do in fulfilling his role as the Messiah ?
[ Picture on page 23 ]
3 : 1 - 5 .
We face what challenge , giving rise to what questions ?
We need answers from God’s standpoint so that we can be guided accordingly .
Are we individually putting forth constant effort to gain a deeper knowledge ? ​ — Prov .
The universe also gives proof that Jehovah is the Source of dynamic energy and inexhaustible power . ​ — Isa .
God’s offering Jesus as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins ought to stir love within us in return .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What is required in order for us to show love for God ?
( b ) Despite what do God’s people observe his commandments ?
Why We Love Our Lord Jesus Christ
What are some of the things that Jesus endured ?
Jesus ’ love for his heavenly Father motivated him to endure those trials .
In view of what Christ did for us , what is our aim ?
In responding to Christ’s love for all mankind , we feel compelled to finish our assignment before the end comes .
This requires that we successfully cultivate love of God to the fullest extent possible .
Because of following Christ’s steps closely , Paul had freeness of speech in urging his brothers to become imitators of him .
The context in the verses that follow shows that this was the surpassing way of love .
Paul proceeded to illustrate what he meant .
( Read 1 Corinthians 13 : 1 - 3 . )
What a powerful impression he made in getting this across to us !
( a ) What is the yeartext for 2010 ?
Paul next defines for us what love is and what it is not .
They would end .
Jehovah is the very essence of love , and he is eternal .
It will continue to exist forever as a quality of our eternal God . ​ — 1 John 4 : 8 .
Such love goes beyond just giving up something in a material way .
For 26 years Jehovah’s Witnesses in Malawi endured governmental bans , severe opposition , and many atrocities .
Thirty years later their number had more than doubled to 38,393 .
What do some in divided households face , and why could they endure the mistreatment ?
Frontal assaults against God’s people in general are one thing .
When opposition comes upon individual Christians from family members , it is quite different .
Stress may be caused by members of the household or immediate relatives .
Not just their love for the brotherhood but , above all , their genuine love for Jehovah and his Son . ​ — 1 Pet .
His Word says that ‘ love endures all things , ’ and a husband and wife clothed with this quality are fortified to stick to each other and keep their marriage intact . ​ — Col .
3 : 14 .
This was the case when an earthquake hit southern Peru and Hurricane Katrina devastated portions of the Gulf area in the United States .
Such acts prove that our brothers love and care for one another at all times and under any circumstances . ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 ; 1 Pet .
Among Jehovah’s people today , we see the wisdom of pursuing the surpassing way of love .
Truly , it excels in any and all situations .
Then he concluded : “ Now , however , there remain faith , hope , love , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
By doing God’s will in pursuing the surpassing way of love that never fails , you may remain forever . ​ — 1 John 2 : 17 .
• In what sense does love never fail ?
[ Blurb on page 27 ]
Love of God motivates us to bear witness

For example , Lisa wanted to make the ministry more of a focus in her life .
She moved from Canada to Kenya .
Trevor and Emily , who also are Canadians , went to Malawi with the goal of expanding their ministry .
They came with the idea of serving along with the local brothers , helping them in the preaching work . ”
And certainly make it a matter of prayer to Jehovah .
If you are not ready to learn a new language or your stay in a foreign land will not be permanent , consider serving where you already speak the predominant language of the country .

If you are thinking of serving in a foreign land , write to the branch offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the countries you have in mind .
Jehovah has really blessed me . ”
Leaving family behind was the real challenge , much worse than we anticipated .
Later , though , they saw how useful it would be to learn a local language .
We were closer to each other and felt Jehovah’s blessing . ”
Some may do better by moving within their own country to an area where the need is greater .

Those who come to serve are the ones who are successful
How the Malagasy translation was produced is a story of persistence and dedication .
Jones did not allow tragedy to deter him .
Soon thereafter , he began preliminary work on the translation of John’s Gospel .
No textbooks , blackboard , or desks were available .
Only a handful of people could read that .
Translating started on September 10 , 1823 .
In addition to doing most of the translating themselves , they continued to teach school in the morning and afternoon .
With the aid of 12 students , the two missionaries translated the entire Greek Scriptures and many books of the Hebrew Scriptures in just 18 months .
When the Malagasy translation was completed , the LMS sent Charles Hovenden to set up Madagascar’s first printing press .
King Radama had been very supportive of the translation project .
On another occasion , when the missionaries told the queen that they still had much to teach the people , including Greek and Hebrew , she said : “ I do not care much about Greek and Hebrew , but I would like to know if you can teach my people something more useful , such as the making of soap . ”
But this decision was short - lived .
The queen’s vacillation , along with the evident growing influence of traditionalists within the government , stimulated the missionaries to finish printing the Bible .
The Christian Greek Scriptures had already been completed , and thousands of copies were in circulation .
However , another impediment came on March 1 , 1835 , when Queen Ranavalona I declared Christianity illegal and ordered that all Christian books be turned in to the authorities .
This was done none too soon , for within the year , all but two missionaries would leave the island .
The Malagasy’s Love for the Bible
So God’s Word is now even more strongly established on the Big Red Island . ​ — Isa .
[ Footnote ]
In view of that wise counsel , how can you set realistic goals for yourself and balance personal study , family care , field service , secular work , and other necessary activities ?
But it was certainly worth the effort .
Reflect , too , on the love God has already shown to you .
Take the matter to Jehovah in prayer .
Good pay and satisfying work are , of course , desirable .
Yet , does your present job help you to promote your family’s spiritual well - being ?
I did not have enough time to care properly either for spiritual matters or for my family . ”
He now makes his living at a job that takes far less of his time and energy .
Christians have many opportunities for such giving .
Some problems no human can solve .
Still , Paul exhorts us : “ Always rejoice in the Lord .
So we can be of good cheer , not losing sight of how much Jehovah is blessing us even now .

It is one tool that scholars use in determining what appeared in the original text of the Bible . ​ — 10 / 1 , pages 18 - 20 .
This includes getting ready to provide materially for a family and to be the spiritual head of a household . ​ — 10 / 15 , page 12 .

No .
One who has studied those languages is still dependent on dictionaries and grammar books .
Jesus did too , and he was ready and willing to help those around him , often even using their names . ​ — 11 / 15 , page 25 . • Why do true Christians avoid celebrating Lunar New Year ?
Lunar New Year is an important festival on Asian calendars .
Christians honor and respect their parents , but they do not join in banquets focused on bonding with deceased ancestors for protection or on seeking the favor of household gods . ​ — 12 / 1 , pages 20 - 23 .
Sadly , we live in a world where trust is routinely destroyed .
There is , however , someone you can trust without ever being disappointed .
Why is Jehovah deserving of such trust ?
To answer that , let us examine the words of Joshua ​ — a man who put his complete trust in Jehovah — ​ recorded at Joshua 23 : 14 .
Knowing that he is about to die , Joshua no doubt has spent many quiet hours contemplating his life .
They have all come true for you . Not one word of them has failed . ”
* The implication is clear : Joshua wants his fellow Israelites to have absolute faith that all of Jehovah’s promises for their future will also come true .
Here are a few of the promises , or assurances , that Joshua saw fulfilled .
( Compare Genesis 12 : 7 with Joshua 11 : 23 . )
( Compare Exodus 3 : 8 with Exodus 12 : 29 - 32 . )

Belonging to Jehovah ​ — An Undeserved Kindness
Prove to Be a Real Follower of Christ
PAGE 24
SONGS TO BE USED : 132 , 133
Jehovah’s Way of Ruling Vindicated !
Purpose of Study Articles
We will also consider why we can be confident that we will be able to do what Jehovah expects of us .
This article examines five important areas in which each of us should strive to imitate Christ .

( Read Acts 27 : 22 - 24 . )
Such a dedication is a personal vow .
Jesus provided an example for us when he made a personal choice to do God’s will .
How Dedication Benefits Us
How , though , does making a dedication benefit us ?
The Law that God gave to Israel describes another relationship in which people benefited by making a commitment .
If a slave wanted the security of belonging permanently to a good master , he could enter a permanent and binding agreement with him .
13 : 7 , 8 ; Heb .
Today , the same holds true .
Being dedicated meant much more for Israel than being committed to do something .
He was loyal and cared for them as a loving parent cares for a child .
Why We Should Dedicate Ourselves to God
While contemplating Christian dedication and baptism , some may wonder , ‘ Why can I not worship God without dedicating myself to him ? ’
( b ) What steps must we take prior to baptism ?
We must get to know God , learn to trust him , repent , and change our ways .
And something else remains to be done before we can be accepted into God’s family .
The father is known to be a good man .
In a similar way , we cannot fully enjoy the benefits of being a member of Jehovah’s family without making a vow of dedication .
So we dedicate ourselves to God because , in spite of our imperfection , we desire to belong to him and are resolved to be loyal to him , come what may . ​ — Matt .
22 : 37 .
We know that it will not always be easy to walk with God while living among “ a crooked and twisted generation , ” but we trust in God’s promise to support us in our efforts .
Jesus fully experienced the happiness of giving during his earthly ministry .
Thus , Jesus pointed his followers toward a satisfying way of life when he said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself . ”
However , those who dedicate themselves to Jehovah find long - lasting happiness .
20 : 5 .
Living in harmony with our dedication leads to our lasting happiness
Besides being a privilege , belonging to Jehovah is also a responsibility .
Will belonging to Jehovah rob me of freedom ? ’
Belonging to Jehovah Leads to Happiness
How did Rahab’s decision to serve Jehovah benefit her ?
How happy she must have been that she left behind her previous way of life !
6 : 25 ; Ruth 2 : 4 - 12 ; Matt .
( Read Ruth 1 : 1 - 6 . )
Later , as Ruth and her sister - in - law , Orpah , started out with their mother - in - law , Naomi , for Bethlehem , Naomi urged the two young women to return home .
What have you observed about people who faithfully serve Jehovah ?
You may know some individuals who after dedicating themselves to Jehovah have been serving him faithfully for decades .
But God was not unreasonable in what he expected of Moses .
Jesus said : “ Come to me , . . . and I will refresh you .
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart . ” ​ — Matt .
Thus , when Jehovah assigned him to be His prophet , Jeremiah said : “ Alas , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah !
That psalm begins : “ Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High will procure himself lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One .
I will say to Jehovah : ‘ You are my refuge and my stronghold , my God , in whom I will trust . ’
( Read Psalm 91 : 9 , 14 . )
Well , Jehovah protected some of his ancient servants physically ​ — in some cases to preserve the genealogical line leading to the promised Messiah .
They found the needed courage to endure because Jehovah protected them spiritually from the danger of breaking their integrity .
“ The secret place of the Most High , ” mentioned by the psalmist , is thus a figurative place of spiritual protection .
Here , Jehovah protects people who say , in effect : ‘ You are my God in whom I will trust . ’
Also , “ the faithful and discreet slave ” provides spiritual food to protect us against the teaching of evolution , the enticement of immoral desires , the pursuit of riches and prominence , and numerous other harmful desires and influences .
We seek the advice of the elders .
Why can you be confident that Jehovah can protect you from anything that could cause you to lose his approval ?
54 : 17 .
Will belonging to Jehovah rob us of freedom ?
So even though unbelievers may promise freedom when they promote a way of life that is at odds with Jehovah’s teachings , any who listen to them will quickly find themselves enslaved to a sinful and degrading lifestyle . ​ — Rom .
We all have a life - threatening condition ​ — an inheritance of sin .
Just as our confidence in a surgeon may grow as we learn of his reputation , so our trust in Jehovah will grow as we continue to learn about him .
Jehovah grants freedom of choice to all people .
Why is belonging to Jehovah an undeserved kindness ?
We will surely never regret choosing to belong to Jehovah .
What are some ways in which Jehovah provides protection ?
“ Every good tree produces fine fruit , but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit . ” ​ — MATT .
Indeed , people are inevitably influenced by what they take into their mind and heart .
( Read Daniel 12 : 3 , 10 . )
Yes , it is not the professing of Christianity that pleases Jehovah but the practicing of it .
For Christ’s true followers , that involves their whole way of life , including their attitude toward money , secular work , entertainment , worldly customs and celebrations , and marriage and other relationships with fellow humans .
As you reflect on those words , ask yourself : ‘ Do I blend in with the world , or do I stand out as different ?
Why did Jesus make God’s Kingdom the main theme of his ministry ?
Why ?
For at least three reasons : First , they cannot preach what they do not understand .
Second , most of them lack the humility and courage needed to face the ridicule and opposition that may result from sharing the Kingdom message with their neighbors .
Some have tried to improve the quality of their ministry by making better use of the Bible .
Proudly Bear God’s Name
In fact , because Jesus proclaimed his Father’s name , he was called “ the Faithful Witness . ” ​ — Rev .
How can we live up to our God - given name ?
A woman in Paris , France , heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses knew the name of God , so she asked the next Witness she met to show her that name in her Bible .
So be proud to bear God’s name and , in imitation of Jesus , to make that precious name manifest to all .
15 , 16 .
“ Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world .
They are no part of the world , just as I am no part of the world . ”
Do others know my stand on unscriptural celebrations and customs as well as on those that may not have a pagan origin but clearly reflect the spirit of the world ? ’ ​ — 2 Cor .
8 : 23 .
What is involved in showing love for Jehovah and our neighbor ?
That love ( a·gaʹpe in Greek ) is a moral love that takes into account duty , principle , and propriety , but it often includes strong emotion .
5 : 22 ) Sheeplike ones cannot help but be moved when they see such love .
Do you show such heartfelt love to your brothers ?
As true Christians , we strive to show love toward all .
The result ?
She discarded her images , resigned from her church , and resumed her Bible study .
Let us , therefore , produce fruitage that honors both the Father and the Son .
“ Everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them , ” said Jesus , “ will be likened to a discreet man , who built his house upon the rock - mass . ”
Yes , if we prove to be real followers of Christ , we will receive God’s favor , and our future will be secure , as if founded on rock !
• How are Christ’s true followers distinguished from the false ?
Jehovah commissioned parents to provide guidance for their offspring .
Some have to do so as a single parent or while facing opposition from an unbelieving mate .
Jehovah was real to me . ”
Personally reading the Word of God is another important way that young people draw closer to Jehovah .
Do your children have their own Bible - reading program ? ​ — Ps .
1 : 1 - 3 ; 77 : 12 .
Also , their spiritual progress may depend on their age .
It includes asking questions and patiently listening to their answers ​ — even if those answers prove to be different from what you would like to hear .
Listening and remembering are vital for successful communication .
“ Eating together was important in our family , ” explains Vincent .
He adds : “ Being accustomed to talking with my parents at mealtimes also helped me to feel comfortable talking with them when I needed help with more serious matters . ”
These sessions helped our children to learn how to defend their faith and to prove that what they believe is true .
Indeed , when confronted with peer pressure , children often need to do more than just say no and walk away .
Such training at home will no doubt equip your children to meet challenges at school and elsewhere .
Is it a place where “ fits of anger , contentions , [ and ] divisions ” are common , or is it known for “ love , joy , [ and ] peace ” ?
If peace is often missing , do you try hard to find out what changes are needed in order to make your home a safe haven for your children ?
Do you know any missionaries or Bethelites with whom your children could develop a friendship , even if just by letters , e - mail , or periodic phone calls ?
Commend Your Children
Let your children know how you feel about them , and be generous with loving commendation .
How his Father’s assurance must have strengthened Jesus to deal with the many challenges he was about to face !

Why is the coming judgment of the wicked comforting news ?
SOONER or later the wicked will have to be brought to justice .
Foremost among the wicked who will be brought to justice is the father of wickedness , Satan the Devil . ​ — John 8 : 44 .
As a result , our first parents joined Satan in challenging Jehovah’s rightful authority and became sinners in His sight .
However , that inevitable outcome had to be made obvious to all intelligent creatures .
Paul said that such superior authorities “ stand placed in their relative positions by God . ”
By no means .
Still , human rule influenced by Satan is certain to fail .
Any governmental arrangement that does not follow his guidance is bound to be inferior .
If he insists on going ahead with his endeavor , he will be forced to recognize his error .
I shall go up above the high places of the clouds ; I shall make myself resemble the Most High . ”
What are some benefits from Jehovah’s allowing wickedness to exist for some time ?
Some may wonder why Jehovah did not prevent humans from taking sides with Satan and from following an alternative plan for governing that was certain to fail .
Nevertheless , he held back .
What misery could have been spared the human family if humans had rejected Satan’s advances and refused to strike out for independence from God’s rule !
9 , 10 .
In addition , Satan’s rebellion has given Jehovah an opportunity to demonstrate His fine qualities in a more pronounced way .
Against the backdrop of Satan’s disastrous rule , Jehovah’s perfect qualities are even more obvious than they otherwise might have been .
Yes , paradoxical as it may sound , Satan’s way of governing has in reality served to glorify God .
Love .
How ?
Could God have shown his love for mankind in a more remarkable way than by sending his only - begotten Son to earth in order to ransom sinners ?
That information can be filed away in Jehovah’s memory .
How was Jesus ’ sacrifice a demonstration of Jehovah’s perfect justice ?
He always holds to the highest standards of truth and of justice , even when doing so appears to be to his own disadvantage .
A world full of injustice gave Jehovah the opportunity of demonstrating himself to be the pinnacle of justice .
What are some of the ways that Jehovah’s superlative wisdom and patience have been manifested ?
Patience and Long - Suffering .
Yes , indeed , but . . . not by [ an ] act of God ​ — the world’s illness was inflicted by its peoples . ”
How true !
Do we have modern - day evidence of that ?
What Did We Learn About Rulership From Reading . . .
Satan’s rule has never benefited mankind
[ Picture on page 27 ]
“ The Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind . ” ​ — DAN .
4 : 17 .
In doing so , they may have thought that they were choosing independence .
What can we say about the way God would have ruled if Adam and Eve had not sinned ?
How tragic that humans rejected it !
Even the powerful king of Babylon was forced to realize that ultimately “ the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind . ”
What commitment did Israel make to God ?
In 1513 B.C.E . , the Israelites committed themselves and their descendants to accept Jehovah as Ruler , saying : “ All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do . ” ​ — Ex .
19 : 8 .
Jehovah’s commandments given through Moses clearly highlighted God’s holiness , his love of justice , his willingness to forgive , and his patience .
8 , 9 .
Being ruled by a human king led to serious problems for Israel , especially when that king proved unfaithful .
5 : 2 , 3 .
That fact impresses upon those taking the lead among Christians that , although they are not rulers like those ancient kings , they must always set a good example of faith . ​ — Heb .
13 : 7 .
How Jehovah Rules Today
What important milestone was reached in 1914 ?
They have continued to act as if “ there is no Jehovah . ” ​ — Ps .
( b ) How is the superiority of God’s rule seen even today ?
Jehovah’s blessing on that arrangement is evident in the spiritual prosperity enjoyed by true worshippers today .
Am I properly supporting Jehovah’s way of governing ?
Am I determined to continue telling others about God’s Kingdom to the extent that I reasonably can ? ’
Willing submission results in a worldwide unity that is unique in this divided world .
What decision faces everyone today ?
Each individual must decide whether he will accept Jehovah’s way of governing or he will cling to human rule .
Soon , at Armageddon , Jehovah’s way of governing will permanently replace human - based governments under Satan’s influence .
In the fullest sense of the word , Jehovah’s way of governing will stand vindicated . ​ — Read Revelation 21 : 3 - 5 .
What facts help meek individuals to make a good decision regarding rulership ?
Even human rulers having the best of intentions have been unable to remove sickness and death , but under God’s rule , the old and the sick will delight in a return to youthful vigor .
Yes , God’s rule will undo all the harm that Satan caused when he influenced our first parents to turn away from their Creator .
Hence , let us demonstrate each day , indeed each hour , of our lives that we are worshippers of Jehovah , subjects of his Kingdom , and proud to be his Witnesses .
• Hebrews 13 : 17 ?
• Revelation 21 : 3 - 5 ?
[ Pictures on page 29 ]
Use Each Day of Your Life for God’s Glory
“ IN THE morning cause me to hear your loving - kindness , ” prayed the psalmist David to Jehovah .
How do we demonstrate our wholehearted love for Jehovah each day ?
Several are listed in the box entitled “ God - Given Responsibilities , ” on page 22 .
Employment , school , and numerous household duties need to be fitted in .
At times , we may be able to combine some of our responsibilities .
12 : 13 .
Show Consideration for Others
We have Jehovah’s assurance that when we are generous toward others , he will be generous toward us . ​ — Prov .
Is it really possible to render sacred service to Jehovah “ day and night ” ?
Yes , by being regular and diligent in all aspects of our worship .
3 : 10 ; 5 : 17 .
3 : 25 , 26 ; Col .
[ Box / ​ Pictures on page 22 ]
• Provide materially , spiritually , and emotionally for our family members . ​ — 1 Tim .
7 : 1 ; 1 Tim .
• A fellow believer whose spouse has died . ​ — 1 Tim .
• A hardworking elder in your congregation . ​ — 1 Thess .
So God disapproves of worship that contradicts the truth of the Bible .
Consider four ways in which imitating Jesus ’ example clearly identifies his followers .
Jesus Christ said in prayer to Jehovah : “ I have made your name known . ”
True Christians still do likewise .
How can true worship benefit you ?
Jehovah promised life without end to those who love him .
The Bible Changes Lives
This organization was fighting the South African regime that ruled Namibia at the time .
We were politically indoctrinated and were taught to hate white people .
Some of those made reference to the Bible , but the explanations did not make sense to me .
Eventually , I even overcame my prejudice against white people .
One of my uncles , who was a prominent member of the government , constantly criticized me for my decision to associate with the Witnesses .
For example , they follow the Bible’s command to preach to others .
For example , giving up marijuana has saved me from wasting hundreds of dollars each month .
I no longer have hallucinations , and my mental and physical health have improved .
I have some good memories of that time with my cousins and uncles ​ — fishing , hunting , making boomerangs , and carving other things .
We would use knives and baseball bats to attack a crowd of 20 or more people .
My goal was to become an assassin .
Every question I had , the Witnesses were able to answer for me from the Bible .
The Bible verses at Ephesians 4 : 22 - 24 had a big impact on me .
I realized that I would have to move away from my associates if I wanted to clean up my life , so I decided to move to another state .
During the trip , they started smoking marijuana and offered me some .
I have learned to control my anger , even when I am provoked .
My friends and I would look for fights .
Draw Close to God
For the next several centuries , Israel’s course could be summed up as a recurring cycle of four phases : defection , oppression , supplication , and deliverance .
Little wonder that the Israelites “ offended Jehovah , ” the God who had delivered Israel out of Egypt ! ​ — Verses 11 - 13 ; Judges 2 : 1 .
The Israelites would then fall “ into the hand of their enemies , ” who would come in and pillage the land . ​ — Verse 14 .
Deliverance .
What do we learn about Jehovah from this account ?
You will never regret it .
Judges 2 : 11 - 18 is part of an introductory summary that gives an overview of Israel’s pattern of behavior , which is recounted in detail in the chapters that follow .
REBEKAH is a common name in many places today .
In her old age , Sarah became the mother of Isaac ​ — her only child .
When Abraham and Sarah are very old , God promises them a child who is to be named Isaac .
Eliezer now prays that the one he should choose to be a wife for Isaac will reply to his request for a drink of water by saying : “ Take a drink , and I shall also water your camels . ”
Just think !
Then she runs ahead to tell them of the visitors that Abraham has sent all the way from Canaan to see them .
When Rebekah’s brother Laban sees the expensive gifts that were given to his sister and learns who Eliezer is , he invites him in .
So he explains why Abraham has sent him .
When Rebekah is asked if she will go without delay , she answers , “ I am willing to go . ”
Right away she leaves with Eliezer .
We too will be blessed if we are willing ​ — like her — ​ to do what pleases Jehovah . ​ — Romans 9 : 7 - 10 .
If you are reading with a child , the dash provides a reminder to pause and encourage the child to express himself .
Who was Rebekah , and where did Eliezer meet her ?
Why did Abraham not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite woman ?
By living in harmony with Jesus ’ instructions , we please Jehovah and enjoy His blessing .
During the first century of our Common Era , thousands of people from different nations embraced the truth and gave public evidence of their devotion to God by being baptized .
This expression was fitting because those who became followers of Christ adhered to a manner of life that centered on faith in Jesus Christ and on imitating his example . ​ — 1 Pet .
Why do Jehovah’s people get baptized , and how many have been immersed in the past ten years ?
During the past ten years , more than 2,700,000 people have made the decision to serve Jehovah and be baptized in symbol of their dedication to him .
That is an average of over 5,000 individuals every week !
Why Get Baptized ?
Your ministry will be joyful , and living in the way that God approves will strengthen your hope of everlasting life .
God has dignified us by giving us free will .
Our baptism is both a symbol of our dedication to God and a public declaration that Jehovah is our Ruler .
In turn , Jehovah is on our side .
Baptism also opens the way for us to receive many other spiritual blessings now and in the future .
7 - 9 . ( a ) What assurance did Jesus give to those who left all things and followed him ?
Peter wanted to know what the future held for him and for Jesus ’ other disciples .
To devote themselves fully to the Kingdom - preaching work , they had made important sacrifices .
He said : “ No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields , with persecutions , and in the coming system of things everlasting life . ”
First - century Christians , such as Lydia , Aquila , Priscilla , and Gaius , were among those who provided “ houses ” and became “ brothers and sisters and mothers ” to fellow believers , as Jesus had promised . ​ — Acts 16 : 14 , 15 ; 18 : 2 - 4 ; 3 John 1 , 5 - 8 .
Jehovah God becomes our secure dwelling place .
Gaining access to “ the secret place ” of Jehovah also implies that we have been blessed with the privilege of having developed a personal relationship with him .
Thereafter , we build on our relationship with God by drawing close to him through Bible study , heartfelt prayer , and full obedience .
Therefore , let us never doubt Jehovah or his desire and ability to help us fulfill our dedication vow .
( Read Isaiah 65 : 13 , 14 . )

Keep On Learning From Jesus
In his prehuman existence , Jesus spent untold millenniums working with his Father .
This teaches us that regardless of what Satan does , we can maintain our integrity .
Opposition may come from well - intentioned but misinformed family members .
Stick to the Best Way of Life !
They were restated by Jesus and others .
This calls for our regular presence at Christian meetings , where the Bible is discussed .
Third , ‘ we must stick to Jehovah . ’
Regardless of what we must face , let us always exercise faith in God and follow his Son . ​ — 2 Cor .
( The Watch Tower , December 15 , 1914 , pages 377 - 378 ) Our gratitude for spiritual light and truth is unchanged .

A Tool to Help Youths Remember Their Creator 30

1 , 2 .
How vital it is , then , that we be effective in our ministry !
Add to this our own personal weaknesses , such as shyness and fear of being rejected .
What can help us to acquire it ?
( a ) What is boldness ?
That word conveys the idea of “ courage , confidence , . . . fearlessness . ”
Boldness does not mean bluntness or rudeness .
Moreover , as we preach the good news of God’s Kingdom , we need to maintain balance between boldness and tactfulness so that we do not offend someone unintentionally .
Indeed , boldness calls for qualities that require much effort to cultivate .
“ By means of our God , ” wrote Paul .
Acquire Boldness
The most direct way to receive God’s holy spirit is to ask for it .
5 : 17 .
What did she do to get the courage to speak up ?
Do these examples not show that when it comes to mustering up boldness , prayer works ?
He states : “ In my heart [ the word of God ] proved to be like a burning fire shut up in my bones ; and I got tired of holding in . ”
Remember that although men were used to write the Bible , it is not a compilation of human wisdom , for it was inspired by God .
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 . )
That message can prove to be “ like a burning fire ” inside us , so that we will be unable to keep it in .
Holy spirit is the most powerful force in the universe , and it can empower humans to do Jehovah’s will .
What if we have lost our zeal for the ministry or our fervor for it is not what it used to be ?
Ask yourself : ‘ Am I still aglow with the spirit ?
Do I pray to Jehovah for his spirit ?
How involved am I in congregation meetings ? ’
The resurrected Jesus told his disciples : “ You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you , and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth . ”
What Did You Learn ?
• What helped the early disciples to speak with boldness ?
It exceeded the total number of Jehovah’s Witnesses by over 10 million .
Before considering how we can do so , let us reflect on just how powerful that Word is .
Scriptural truth reaches the innermost part of a person and penetrates his thoughts and emotions , exposing what he really is on the inside .
The Word of God illuminates not only our immediate steps but also the roadway ahead .
With the road ahead figuratively well - lit , we are able to take into consideration the long - term effects of our decisions .
The Scriptures also foretell God’s purpose for the future , helping us to pursue a lifestyle that is consistent with that purpose .
Think , too , of what a powerful weapon the Bible is in our spiritual warfare .
What will help us to ‘ handle the word of truth aright ’ in our ministry ?
He wrote : “ You were , of course , called for freedom , brothers ; only do not use this freedom as an inducement for the flesh , but through love slave for one another . ”
To understand the meaning of a scripture correctly , we should consider background information , such as who wrote the Bible book and when and under what circumstances it was written .
We should heed the apostle Peter’s admonition : “ Sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts , always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you , but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
3 : 15 .
Give an example .
Scriptural truth can overturn “ strongly entrenched things , ” that is , expose false doctrines , harmful practices , and philosophies that reflect imperfect human wisdom .
From infancy she was taught to believe in reincarnation .
What does it mean to persuade our listeners ?
( Read Acts 19 : 8 , 9 ; 28 : 23 . )
After posing a question and getting the householder’s response , you may want to say something to this effect , ‘ Let us see how we can get God’s mind on the matter . ’
It was Paul’s custom to ‘ explain and prove by references ’ the things he taught .
A Scriptural text often contains more than one point , and you may need to isolate key expressions that apply to what you are discussing .
See the brochure What Happens to Us When We Die ?
• What can the message of the Bible accomplish as to “ strongly entrenched things ” ?
▪ Reason convincingly so as to reach the heart
“ The spirit and the bride keep on saying : ‘ Come ! ’ . . .
22 : 17 .
He compared the Kingdom of God to a pearl so valuable that upon finding it , a traveling merchant “ sold all the things he had and bought it . ”
Should we not attach the utmost importance to the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work ?
As we saw in the two preceding articles , our speaking with boldness and our using the Word of God skillfully in the ministry demonstrate that we are directed by God’s spirit .
The first couple were expelled from their garden home “ in order that [ Adam ] may not put his hand out and actually take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live to time indefinite . ”
This symbolic river is Jehovah’s means to undo all the harm brought upon mankind by Adam’s disobedience .
Though the “ river of water of life ” will flow in the fullest sense during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ , it begins to flow in “ the Lord’s day , ” which dawned with the heavenly enthronement of “ the Lamb ” in 1914 .
They involve God’s Word , the Bible , for its message is spoken of as “ water . ”
to herself . Her words are directed to those who hope to gain everlasting life on earth after “ the war of the great day of God the Almighty ” has been fought . ​ — Read Revelation 16 : 14 , 16 .
In part , the article stated : “ The faithful remnant class join [ the Most High ] in the gracious invitation and say , ‘ Come . ’
How have those hearing the invitation been invited to say , “ Come ! ” in response ?
They are invited to say , “ Come ! ”
In 1935 , the identity of the “ great crowd ” mentioned at Revelation 7 : 9 - 17 was made clear .
Having appreciatively heard the message , they have made a dedication to God , undergone water baptism , and joined the bride class in actively inviting others to ‘ come and drink life’s water free . ’
How is God’s spirit involved in extending the invitation in our day ?
It comes from the Bible ​ — the book written under the direct influence of God’s spirit .
They “ Keep On Saying : ‘ Come ! ’ ”
14 , 15 .
How clearly his actions indicated to observers that nothing is more important than regular worship of Jehovah ! ​ — Matt .
Daniel immediately replied : “ O king , live on even to times indefinite .
If at all possible , should we not endeavor to participate in the ministry each week ?
Even if we are very limited physically and can witness for just 15 minutes during the month , we should report this activity .
We should seek to extend Jehovah’s invitation at every opportunity , not just at times that we have set aside for the public ministry .
Even if authorities restrict the preaching work , we continue to preach discreetly ​ — perhaps by staggering our house - to - house visits or by increasing our informal witnessing .
What a privilege that is !

Do You View Jehovah as Your Father ?
When one of his disciples made that request , Jesus responded : “ Whenever you pray , say , ‘ Father , let your name be sanctified . ’ ”
Instead , Jesus chose the term “ Father . ”
Some individuals , though , find it difficult to think of God as their Father .
Citing a reason for her struggle , she says , “ I cannot recall a time when my biological father showed me affection . ”
In these critical last days , the “ natural affection ” one expects to receive from a father is grossly lacking .
We can take heart , however , because we have sound reasons to view Jehovah as our loving Father .
An excellent way to come to know what Jehovah is like as a Father is to reflect on what Jesus revealed about the true God .
Was it not love ?
And because our heavenly Father is the Fulfiller of his promises , we can be sure that all who love and obey him will eventually enjoy “ the glorious freedom of the children of God . ” ​ — Rom .
It is unlikely that we consider it necessary to pray for the rising of the sun .
Moreover , our Father is the matchless Provider , who knows our material needs before we ever ask him .
Our Father ​ — The “ Tender Protector ”
Isaiah’s prophecy assured God’s ancient people : “ The mountains will shift and the hills be unsettled , but my friendship will never shift away from you nor my covenant of peace be unsettled , says your tender protector Jehovah . ”
Jesus was always certain of Jehovah’s support .
At his baptism , for instance , he received loving reassurance from the Father , who declared : “ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . ”
With Jehovah on our side , what do we have to fear ?
But then she undertook a study of Jesus ’ life and ministry , particularly focusing on his intimate relationship with his heavenly Father .
Really , there is no reason for us to worry about anything . ”
It “ will guide you into all the truth , ” said Jesus .
I myself will help you . ’ ”
Your God will not help you .
The envoy’s words were calculated to undermine the morale of the people of Jerusalem and frighten them into surrendering . ​ — 2 Ki .
18 : 28 - 35 .
According to historian Philip Taylor , they employed “ a policy of terror coupled with one of propaganda , designed to keep conquered peoples down and to frighten potential enemies with graphic propagandist imagery and brutal psychology . ”
Propaganda is a potent weapon .
It “ assaults the mind , ” says Taylor .
True Christians “ have a wrestling , not against blood and flesh , but against . . . the wicked spirit forces , ” that is , against spirit creatures who rebelled against God .
In other words , apply enough pressure , and sooner or later a man will break his integrity to God .
Do all of us have a breaking point ​ — one beyond which we will abandon our principles in order to stay alive ?
Hence , he uses insidious propaganda to plant that idea in our minds .
Satan used Eliphaz , one of Job’s three visiting companions , to argue that men are hopelessly weak .
We are weak because of inherited sin and imperfection .
Then he proceeded to answer , saying : “ Look !
He wants us to worry about past mistakes , become overly self - critical , and think that we are irredeemable .
He also wants us to overestimate what Jehovah expects of us and to underestimate His compassion , forgiveness , and support .
Surely not !
Our “ hope of salvation ” ​ — our confidence in the fulfillment of God’s promises about his glorious new world — ​ will protect our minds from Satan’s lies .
Job endured vicious and hateful attacks from Satan .
Jehovah can counter anything that Satan and his agents may bring against us .
At the time of baptism , for instance , an individual may secretly have been living in a situation or engaging in a practice that could have resulted in his being disfellowshipped if he had already been validly baptized .
Therefore , a person baptized while such a serious impediment existed may appropriately consider the necessity of rebaptism .
Everyone needs a place to live .
A person’s economic circumstances , health issues , or other factors may make it necessary for extended families , including a number of relatives , to live together .
What are some of these principles ?
“ Do not be misled , ” wrote the apostle Paul . “ Bad associations spoil useful habits . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
What if two people who are not married to each other unexpectedly find themselves alone together because others who would normally be present are momentarily absent ?
A final but no less important matter to take into consideration is how the community views one’s choices .
Paul put it this way : “ Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God , even as I am pleasing all people in all things , not seeking my own advantage but that of the many , in order that they might get saved . ” ​ — 1 Cor .

ON December 9 , 2008 , the Swedish Academy for the Rights of the Child held a unique seminar with the theme “ The Child’s Right to Spiritual Development . ”
That Ethiopian is no exception .
Children need guidance and direction , and their parents have the responsibility to give them moral and spiritual education based on the Bible and on what is taught in the Christian congregation .
From an early age , they need help to build a firm Biblical foundation for spiritual development so that they may become “ mature people . . . who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ” ​ — Heb .

It also gives them practical suggestions on how to take a stand for what is right .

That can help young ones to look to their parents for valuable advice .
As a parent , your goal is to reach the heart of your child .
Consider how one father has been able to use this book to promote heartfelt communication with his daughter .
I would not look to see what she had written .
I would never have guessed that she would pick that one !

“ The Righteous Ones Will Shine as Brightly as the Sun ”
In Jesus ’ illustration of the wheat and the weeds , what does the fine seed represent ?
( a ) Who is the man in the illustration ?
What a fitting picture of imitation Christians , those who claim to be sons of the Kingdom but do not produce genuine fruitage !
When did the weeds start to appear , and how were men “ sleeping ” at the time ?
When was this ?
After the apostles , who acted as “ a restraint ” against the apostasy , began falling asleep in death , many Christians fell asleep spiritually .
( Read 2 Thessalonians 2 : 3 , 6 - 8 . )
Rather , it points to a deliberate effort on the part of Satan to corrupt the Christian congregation by introducing wicked people into it .
His answer may seem surprising .
That command would make sense to Jesus ’ disciples .
The Long - Anticipated Harvesttime
“ First ” Babylon the Great fell , and “ then ” the sons of the Kingdom were gathered together at the start of the harvest .
But how is the symbolic wheat now being brought into Jehovah’s storehouse ?
These harvested ones were either brought into the restored Christian congregation , where they have God’s favor and protection , or they received their heavenly reward .
For how long does the harvest continue ?
( Read Jude 4 . )
“ The sons of the wicked one ” are tormented by the fact that “ the sons of the kingdom ” have exposed the spiritually poisonous condition of these weedlike ones .
The imitation , weedlike Christians , the impostors , will be eradicated during the “ great tribulation . ” ​ — Matt .
Concerning the cleansing of God’s temple , Malachi prophesied : “ ‘ Suddenly there will come to His temple the true Lord , whom you people are seeking , and the messenger of the covenant in whom you are delighting .
For he will be like the fire of a refiner and like the lye of laundrymen .
Malachi tells us what happens once this cleansing is completed : “ You people will again certainly see the distinction between a righteous one and a wicked one , between one serving God and one who has not served him . ”
The prophet Daniel spoke of our day when he foretold : “ The ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse ; and those who are bringing the many to righteousness , like the stars to time indefinite , even forever . ”
What do “ the sons of the kingdom ” eagerly await , and what will we discuss in the next article ?
The sowing refers to the anointing of these sons of the Kingdom in the world field .
• The sowing of the seed
The symbolic wheat is now being brought into Jehovah’s storehouse
One Flock , One Shepherd
19 : 28 .
These converts , or proselytes , were viewed as part of the nation .
24 : 22 .
3 , 4 . ( a ) How did the apostle Peter identify the new nation ?
Later , many non - Israelites were also included in this nation , for Peter went on to say : “ You were once not a people , but are now God’s people . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
To whom was Peter here speaking ?
In the beginning of his letter , he says : “ [ God ] gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance .
This will take place during “ the re - creation , ” or time of regeneration , during Christ’s Millennial Rule . ​ — Read Matthew 19 : 28 ; ftn .
These will survive the great tribulation into Christ’s Millennial Reign .
There they will be joined by billions of resurrected ones .
Also on the ancient Atonement Day , two goats were provided for the sins of the other Israelites .
Jesus spoke of “ other sheep , ” who would not be of the same “ fold ” as the “ little flock ” of his anointed followers .
Two groups of people have been joined together ​ — the small group of anointed ones and the great crowd of other sheep .
Although the other sheep do not symbolically serve in the inner courtyard of the spiritual temple , they do serve in the outer courtyard of that temple .
But if Jehovah sometimes uses the nonpriestly members of ancient Israel to picture these other sheep , should those with an earthly hope also partake of the Memorial emblems ?
We will now consider the answer to this question .
Jehovah foretold a new arrangement for his people when he said : “ This is the covenant that I shall conclude with the house of Israel after those days . . . .
Some , like the apostles who drank of that cup that evening , are participants in the new covenant .
Those in the new covenant “ have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place . ”
When does the Lord ‘ arrive ’ ?
And my tabernacle will actually prove to be over them , and I shall certainly become their God , and they themselves will become my people . ” ​ — Ezek .
His sanctuary , here picturing pure Christian worship , is among them .
Although the ever - growing great crowd do not have the heavenly hope , they are proud to be associated with those who do .
By means of the new covenant , Jehovah has made all of this possible .
They are determined to continue to lay hold of that covenant by accepting its provisions and obeying its requirements .
In so doing , along with the Israel of God , they enjoy the rich blessings of continued peace .

What led up to so many getting baptized ?

And from the Hebrew Scriptures , they knew about the holy spirit , God’s active force used during creation and thereafter .
They had been trying to follow his Law , which was the reason those from other lands had come to Jerusalem .
He rejected the Jews as his special nation ; their keeping the Law was no longer the means to obtain his approval .
Indeed , those Jews and proselytes could now see that a relationship with Jehovah involved recognizing him as the Provider of salvation by means of Jesus .
4 : 16 .
Such ones can be likened to a sick man who was unaware of his illness .
Does knowing this not help us to recognize God’s authority and obey his commands out of love ?
In the Name of the Son
( b ) How do you feel about Jesus ’ dying as a ransom ?
Think again , though , about what Peter said to the crowd .
Why was that vital then , and why is it vital now ?
Being baptized in the name of the Son means acknowledging what Jesus has done for you and accepting his authority as “ the Chief Agent of life . ”
Jesus then made this point : Jehovah will not forgive the one who does not forgive his brother .
When you come to respect a friend , you likely try to learn from his example and good qualities .
There is another way you can show that you understand what is involved in having been baptized in the name of the Son .
If you are yet to be baptized , what blessings can you look forward to after baptism ?
In the Name of the Holy Spirit
16 , 17 .
Today , many things are done “ in the name of the government , ” which is not a person .
Have you not come to know about the holy spirit through studying the Bible ?
You have probably seen holy spirit working in your life .
What blessings come to those being baptized in the name of the holy spirit ?
[ Footnotes ]
• What does it mean to be baptized in the name of the Son ?
• How can you show that you appreciate the significance of getting baptized in the name of the Father and the Son ?
After Pentecost 33 C.E . , the new disciples came into what relationship with the Father ?
“ Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all . ” ​ — GAL .
The historical record says : “ Those who embraced his word heartily were baptized , and on that day about three thousand souls were added . ”
2 , 3 . ( a ) Explain the difference between being baptized with holy spirit and being baptized in the name of the holy spirit . ( b ) Why is water baptism expected of all who become true Christians today ?
Yes .
Those who are baptized with holy spirit are born again as spirit - begotten sons of God .
But what of water baptism in the name of the holy spirit , something that regularly occurs at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah’s people in our day ?
In a sense , you “ put the practices of the body to death by the spirit . ”
It will help to set your mind on the things of the spirit and cooperate with its leadings , rather than let yourself be controlled by fleshly desires .
Yes , how you cultivate the soil of your heart makes a difference in the quality and quantity of the fruitage of the holy spirit in you .
In order to cultivate the fruitage of the spirit , you need the waters of truth found in the Bible and available through the Christian congregation today .
In order to come under the influence of the holy spirit , we must read and meditate on God’s Word .
It is noteworthy that even the angels have shown deep interest in spiritual truths regarding the promised Seed and the anointed Christian congregation . ​ — Read 1 Peter 1 : 10 - 12 .
You need to keep asking for Jehovah’s help and guidance .
Well , for one thing , by praying for holy spirit , you acknowledge your reliance on Jehovah .
Likewise , Jehovah finds pleasure in your asking him for his spirit , and he will give it to you . ​ — Prov .
How can attending Christian meetings help you to come under the influence of God’s spirit ?
Doing so helps you to understand “ the deep things of God . ”
How often did you raise your hand , offering to answer , to make an expression of your faith ?
Jehovah will see your willingness to participate and will provide his holy spirit , which will help you to get even more out of the meetings you attend .
And the spirit motivates brothers and sisters to do all they can in preaching and teaching .
Illustrate .
It proved to be especially useful in the Japanese field .
As an ordained minister , you have a ministry to perform .
One complication is that some with whom you once associated may be puzzled at your new way of life and may ‘ speak abusively of you . ’
Jehovah through his spirit will help you to have friends who will continue to be a good influence on you .
That is especially a time for you to turn to Jehovah , asking for his holy spirit .
We need God’s spirit so that we can lead a life dedicated to him .
You have to identify , as it were , the right wind and catch it .
If you recognize the holy spirit’s role in accomplishing Jehovah’s will today and appreciate its operation , then take the steps you have learned to be right .
That can continue to be the case ​ — yes , into the endless future .

Most of us have been or will be in that situation .
He was a mere shepherd boy when Samuel anointed him as future king .
Young David was invited to live at the royal court of King Saul and was appointed as head of the army .
David’s relationship with Saul became extremely strained .
Humility Helps Us
In a sense , Saul’s disobedience had a negative effect on Jonathan .
Despite being much older and more experienced , Jonathan loyally upheld David .
At a certain point , Jonathan had dealings with two men who were close to him .
The other was Saul , his father , who had been rejected by Jehovah yet was still ruling as king .
Modesty involves being aware of one’s limitations .
David was modest .
Yet , this situation , while seemingly frustrating , did not disturb him .
Meekness is mildness of temper .
Meekness is related to humility and modesty , but it also embraces other qualities , such as goodness and mildness .
You have likely observed that many tend to view changes in a negative light .
Moses ’ life illustrates that .
He learned to put spiritual interests ahead of personal ones .
Moses interceded for the nation .
On another occasion , Jehovah’s spirit settled upon some men , causing them to prophesy .
Jehovah invited him to go up on Mount Horeb and stand before the people .
What about us ?
All who have been entrusted with privileges and authority among God’s people need to be meek .
It prevents us from being proud when we are faced with changes and enables us to deal with situations with the right attitude .
It may turn out to be a unique chance to cultivate meekness !
Mark ​ — ‘ Useful for Ministering ’
What caused two apostles to argue over him ?
At Home in Jerusalem
The first we learn about him directly is in connection with the history of the early Christian congregation .
That “ quite a few ” met there suggests that the home was large .
And the house is referred to as her home rather than her husband’s , so it is possible that she was a widow and that Mark was still quite young . ​ — Acts 12 : 13 .
Privileges in the Congregation

A casual reader might assume that there was no particular tie ​ — beyond the spiritual one — ​ between these three , that Paul and Barnabas recruited Mark simply because of his abilities .
Perhaps Mark was to care for practical needs during the trip so that the apostles could concentrate on spiritual matters .
Paul , Barnabas , and Mark traversed Cyprus , preaching as they went ; then they headed for Asia Minor .
This is what provoked the scene described in the introduction .
Clearly , Paul and Barnabas differed in their view of Mark’s earlier decision .
Yet , he remained a faithful minister .
In 60 - 61 C.E . , while Paul was in prison in Rome , he sent a number of letters that are now part of the Holy Scriptures .
4 : 10 , 11 .
Had Paul years before been overcritical of Mark ?
Mark the Traveler
He came from Jerusalem , moved to Antioch , and from there sailed to Cyprus and Perga .
The apostle Peter penned his first letter in about 62 to 64 C.E .
And how can we doubt that he responded to Paul’s summons to return to Rome with Timothy ?
Another Great Privilege
In fact , Peter witnessed practically all that Mark recorded .
Analysts of Mark’s Gospel believe that he wrote for Gentile readers ; he provided helpful explanations of Jewish practices .
Just as he went out of his way to minister to his Christian brothers , so we are willing to put forth effort to help our fellow believers in practical ways to carry out their service to God .
As we do so , we can be sure that we will continue to receive Jehovah’s blessing . ​ — Prov .
Some of the Cities That Mark Visited
“ NO ONE can deny that chastity is a problem in the Church today . ”
Catholic journalist Vittorio Messori made that observation on the sex scandals that have recently involved the Church in Italy .
Rampant wickedness is without doubt a sign of these “ last days ” of the present system of things .
According to one reference work , the Biblical term for heart indicates the “ innermost part of man ” and “ is supremely the one centre in man to which God turns , in which the religious life is rooted , which determines moral conduct . ”
3 : 4 .
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus declared : “ Happy are the pure in heart . ”
He was referring to those who are , in effect , clean inside .
We cannot remain “ pure in heart ” if we develop a heart “ lacking faith . ”
These include the theory of evolution , moral and religious relativism , and doubt concerning the divine inspiration of the Holy Scriptures .
Such love and appreciation are indispensable if we want to reject false reasonings and keep our faith in Jehovah strong so that we can maintain a pure heart . ​ — 1 Tim .
When we act uprightly , honesty can result in a fine witness .
Some of Emilio’s colleagues were so impressed by his conduct that they became interested in the Bible and started to study .
As a result , seven people from two families have accepted the truth .
I read the Bible every day , trying to hear what Jehovah was really saying , and I carefully studied the theocratic publications .
Now Gabriele is once again serving as a pioneer , along with his wife .
What happened to him confirms how a study of the Bible and publications from “ the faithful and discreet slave ” can help a person have a pure heart and reject immorality . ​ — Matt .
“ Purity of Heart ” When Under Trial
5 : 8 .
The context of Ezekiel chapter 18 shows that personal accountability is being stressed .
God did not hold them accountable for their father’s sin .
26 : 10 , 11 .
Granted , there were some who maintained their integrity and kept God’s commandments despite the nation’s idolatrous course .
When Israel became so flagrant in violating Jehovah’s principles that his name became an object of derision among the nations , Jehovah determined to punish his people by allowing them to be taken captive to Babylon .
High Priest Eli offended Jehovah by allowing his “ good - for - nothing , ” immoral sons to remain as priests .
The principle of Exodus 20 : 5 is illustrated by the example of Gehazi as well .
He abused his position as Elisha’s attendant in order to benefit materially from the curing of Syrian General Naaman .
As Creator and Life - Giver , Jehovah has every right to determine what punishment is just and appropriate .
The above instances show that children or descendants may feel the ill effects of their ancestors ’ sin .

Billions of people have lived and died on this earth .
You turn on the lights while you are getting ready .
His breakthroughs helped to make electricity more available for human use .
Johannes Gutenberg About 1450 , this German inventor developed the first printing press using movable type .
Rather , this man of humble background who died nearly 2,000 years ago left behind a message ​ — a powerful message of hope and comfort .
When measured by the degree to which his message has affected the lives of people earth wide , many would agree that he truly is the man who changed the world .
“ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 24 .
“ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ” ​ — Acts 20 : 35 .
As we examine this message on the pages that follow , we will see why Jesus continues to hold millions of “ hearts and minds in his gentle grasp . ”
What was his purpose in life ?
The Son of God Jehovah has many angelic sons .
The promised Messiah “ I know that Messiah is coming , ” said a Samaritan woman to Jesus .
He replied : “ I who am speaking to you am he . ”
Clearly , Jesus was no ordinary man .
But the Son wants to tell others about the Father , so that they can know him too . ” ​ — LUKE 10 : 22 , CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH VERSION .
On the night before his death , Jesus could say in prayer to Jehovah : “ I have made your name known . ”
Having experienced God’s love in heaven , Jesus when on earth sought to reveal that love in its many beautiful facets .
Jesus taught that Jehovah is like a shepherd to whom each one of his sheep is distinct and precious .
Jesus said that not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without Jehovah’s knowledge .
Jehovah is eager to forgive a repentant sinner .
There are more than 110 references to that Kingdom in the four Gospels .
Jesus repeatedly referred to the Kingdom of God as “ the kingdom of the heavens . ”
* God’s Kingdom , therefore , is a heavenly government .
Jesus fully expected to return to heaven following his sojourn on earth .
God’s will is being done in heaven .
What will the Kingdom do on earth ?
The earth , Jesus taught , will be filled with people who are “ mild - tempered , ” righteous , merciful , “ pure in heart , ” and peaceable . ​ — Matthew 5 : 5 - 9 .
A man who was to be executed alongside Jesus said : “ Jesus , remember me when you get into your kingdom . ”
He also showed what it will do .
Not even death itself could stay the hand of God’s appointed King .
That all depends upon how you choose to respond to Jesus ’ message .
What God and Christ gave Jesus knew that he was to die a painful death at the hands of his enemies .
Why did he say that his life would be given rather than taken ?
This provision , called the ransom , is God’s greatest gift to humankind .
That is up to you .
For more information about the Scriptural teaching of the ransom , see chapter 5 , “ The Ransom ​ — God’s Greatest Gift , ” of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Jesus was born on December 25 .
MANY would respond that all those statements are factual .
Others might say that it is difficult ​ — even impossible — ​ to know for sure .
We gain that knowledge by examining the Gospels .
STATUS : MYTH .
Consider : The day of Jesus ’ birth is unknown .
* Clearly , Jesus wanted emphasis to be placed , not on his birth , but on the value of his sacrificial death . ​ — Matthew 20 : 28 .
Evidently , they arrived some months after Jesus ’ birth . ​ — Matthew 2 : 9 - 11 .
The Bible does not say .
* Some have even proposed that each of the so - called wise men represented a different race of mankind .
Some suggest that the brothers and sisters in question were actually Jesus ’ cousins .
On the contrary , some of them likely witnessed Mary’s pregnancies with their own eyes .
Rather , The Encyclopædia Britannica observes : “ Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament . . .
Has this article uncovered any facts about Jesus that you did not previously know ?
Such study can be both enjoyable and rewarding .
What was Jesus like as a person ?
Was he so austere , so cold and aloof , that he could not relate to common people ?
Some would answer yes .
Perhaps that is why they are surprised to learn that Jesus . . .
▪ A number of secular writers who lived close to the time of Jesus made specific mention of him .
Regarding a fire that devastated Rome in 64 C.E . , Tacitus relates that it was rumored that Emperor Nero was responsible for the disaster .
Both words literally mean “ Anointed One . ”
Let us take a closer look .
A Central Feature of Jewish Life Three times in the year , Jewish males would travel to Jerusalem for the festivals held at the sacred temple there .
What were those buildings like ?
Next , there was a reading and exposition from the Torah , the first five books of the Bible , which were penned by Moses .
Sometimes court hearings were held there , as well as community meetings and even assemblies with meals served in connected dining rooms .
Travelers were sometimes put up in rooming facilities in the synagogue complex .
It is not surprising , then , that the meetings of first - century Christians had much in common with those Jewish synagogue meetings .
In Christian meetings , the purpose was likewise to worship Jehovah by means of prayer , songs of praise , and readings and discussions of God’s Word .
Jehovah’s Witnesses today endeavor to adhere to the model laid down by Jesus and his first - century followers .
Our Readers Ask . . .
▪ Put simply , the answer is yes .
The same situation occurs with names in the Bible .
The prefix “ arch ” means “ principal ” or “ chief , ” and the word “ archangel ” is never used in the plural form in the Bible .
So Jesus Christ himself is here identified as the archangel , or chief angel .
Philippians 2 : 9 states : “ God exalted him [ the glorified Jesus ] to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name . ”
So Michael the archangel is Jesus in his prehuman existence .
He Learned Forgiveness From the Master
Did he see in Jesus ’ gaze some hint of disappointment or reproach ?
It was a low point for Peter , perhaps the worst moment of the worst day of his life .
Because Peter was a man of great faith , he still had an opportunity to recover from his mistakes and to learn one of Jesus ’ greatest lessons .
A Man With Much to Learn
About six months earlier in his hometown of Capernaum , Peter approached Jesus and asked : “ Lord , how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him ?
No ; rather , by turning Peter’s 7 into a 77 , he was saying that there is no arbitrary limit on forgiveness .
Nonetheless , Jesus corrected them kindly and even commended them for what they had done well ​ — showing faithfulness in sticking to their Master .
Peter countered that he would stick with Jesus even in the face of death .
In fact , throughout this difficult time , Jesus kept looking for the good in his imperfect apostles .
Jesus asked him , as well as James and John , to keep on the watch while He prayed .
Before long , a mob arrived , bearing torches and armed with swords and clubs .
Yet , Peter rashly leaped into action , swinging a sword at the head of Malchus , a slave of the high priest , and lopping off one of the man’s ears .
Jesus calmly corrected Peter , healed the wound , and explained a principle of nonviolence that guides his followers to this day .
Then Peter fled , as did his fellow apostles .
Peter and John stopped in their flight , perhaps near the house of the former High Priest Annas , where Jesus was first taken for questioning .
Such homes were usually built around a courtyard , with a gate in the front .
She knew him .
But a group of people standing around in the courtyard approached .
One of them was related to Malchus , the slave whom Peter had wounded .
Peter felt driven to convince them that they were wrong .
He headed into the streets of the city , his way lit by the sinking full moon .
The sights swam before his eyes .
Peter may have wondered as much himself .
It is hard to imagine the depth of Peter’s pain as the morning broke and the events of the day unfolded .
Peter must have shuddered to think of how he had added to his Master’s pain on what turned out to be the last day of His life as a man .
No doubt all the apostles regretted how they had behaved on that dark night , and they brought one another a measure of comfort .
When one is burdened by sadness or regret , isolation is tempting but dangerous .
Not Peter .
Did Peter believe that Jesus had been resurrected ?
He did something else first , though , something private .
In the Bible , the details of that touching reunion are left between Jesus and Peter .
More than anything in the world , he wanted forgiveness .
The creaking of the boat , the lapping of the waves , the feel of the coarse nets in his hands must all have seemed comfortingly familiar .
They complied and pulled in a great catch of 153 fish !
He focused on Peter .
In Peter’s heart , would love for the fishing business compete with love for Jesus ?
Surely that mercy touched Peter , and he took it to heart .
Peter faithfully carried out his assignment for many years .
Peter worked kindly and patiently at shepherding and feeding Christ’s followers .
May we learn that lesson as well .
“ The Lord turned and looked upon Peter ”

Did you know that even Jesus had to learn to be obedient ? —
“ Be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord , ” the Bible says .
Do you know how they became his parents ? —
Jehovah made this pregnancy possible by performing a great miracle .
Actually , Joseph was his adoptive father .
They searched frantically for their son .
Here your father and I in mental distress have been looking for you . ”
But Jesus replied : “ Why did you have to go looking for me ?
Do you think it was wrong for Jesus to answer his mother that way ? — Well , his parents knew that he loved to worship at God’s house .
Yet , it wasn’t always easy for Jesus to obey ​ — even his heavenly Father .
If you are reading with a child , the dash provides a reminder to pause and encourage the child to express himself .

Is it possible that he married Mary Magdalene and fathered children by her ?
They could also easily expose any inaccuracies .
Professor F .
For example , note what Professor of Church History Oskar Skarsaune states : “ Which writings that were to be included in the New Testament , and which were not , was never decided upon by any church council or by any single person . . .
Other writings , letters , or ‘ gospels ’ that were written later were not included . . .
This process was essentially completed a long time before Constantine and a long time before his church of power had been established .
According to the Bible , one of the miraculous gifts of the spirit that were given in the early decades of the Christian congregation was “ discernment of inspired utterances . ”
So some of those Christians were given a superhuman ability to discern the difference between sayings that were truly inspired by God and those that were not .
They paint a picture of Jesus and Christianity that is not in harmony with the inspired Scriptures .
The Gospel of Judas depicts Jesus as laughing at his disciples for praying to God in connection with a meal .
Why trust such unreliable sources , especially when reliable ones are at hand ?
What about Jesus Christ , the King of God’s heavenly Kingdom ?
The answer can be found in the words Jehovah spoke to King David of ancient Israel , as recorded in 2 Samuel chapter 7 .
In response to David’s devotion and in line with prophecy , God makes a covenant with David that He will raise up someone in David’s royal line who will rule forever .
Recall that Jehovah saw and valued the intention of David’s heart .
It is reassuring to know that Jehovah appreciates our devotion to his worship .
If so , may we draw comfort from the fact that Jehovah sees even the intentions of a heart that is filled with devotion to his worship .
Why ?
In most places , it will be delivered at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses on Sunday , April 18 , 2010 .

She says , “ After praying to Jehovah , I declined the scholarship and began serving as a regular pioneer . ”
Why is your good conduct important in Jehovah’s eyes ?

How did one sister make Jehovah’s heart rejoice ?
As a teenager , a Christian sister named Carol stuck to Bible principles while she attended school , and her good conduct was noticed .
On those occasions , she at times had the opportunity to explain her beliefs to others .
Your good conduct and example as a Christian youth , along with the courageous stand you took regarding holidays , did not go unnoticed .
She wrote in her card to Carol that she had been a baptized Witness for over 40 years !
All of us in Jehovah’s worldwide organization are thrilled to see the many thousands of zealous young ones who are sharing in true worship !
These youths strengthen their desire to worship Jehovah by daily Bible reading , by praying , and by conducting themselves in harmony with God’s will .
A plan might be compared to mapping out a detailed path , whereas a purpose may involve having in mind a goal but not necessarily one specific manner of reaching it .
When it comes to carrying out his will , Jehovah has , not a fixed plan , but an unfolding purpose .
When Adam and Eve sinned , Jehovah met that situation and made arrangements to ensure that his purpose would be accomplished .
Not until some 2,000 years later did Jehovah again make reference to a seed .
To Abraham , Jehovah gave an expanded promise .
That Adversary no doubt wanted nothing more than to destroy or corrupt Abraham’s line of descent and thus frustrate God’s purpose .
5 , 6 .
What it does tell us is that Jehovah intervened .
In what ways did Jehovah protect the nation of Israel ?
What shows that holy spirit was directly involved in the life and ministry of God’s Son ?
Holy spirit was directly involved in the life and ministry of Jesus .
It caused an imperfect woman to conceive and give birth to a perfect Son , who was not under the penalty of death .
The spirit later protected the infant Jesus from premature death .
Starting at Pentecost 33 C.E . , Jehovah used his spirit to anoint the secondary part of the seed of Abraham , many of whom were not descendants of Abraham .
His favor had shifted to the newly formed Christian congregation .
Protecting , empowering , anointing ​ — these are just a few of the ways that Jehovah used the holy spirit in Bible times to keep his purpose moving ever forward toward its fulfillment .
What , though , about our day ?
Holy Spirit’s Role at Present
( Read 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 . )
The desires that give birth to sinful acts can be deeply entrenched .
By keeping morally clean , you show that you are letting that spirit be a dominant force in your life .
In Ezekiel’s vision , the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization is depicted as a celestial chariot that is irresistibly on the move to fulfill Jehovah’s purpose .
13 : 17 .
( Read Matthew 24 : 32 - 34 . )

What will these contain ?
With eager anticipation , we await that new world .
Therefore , let it be your firm determination to supplicate Jehovah for his spirit and work in harmony with its leadings .
Thus you may have the prospect of living as Jehovah purposed humans to live ​ — forever in Paradise on earth .

HOW precious our sight is !
Our sight enables us to see beloved friends or unwelcome dangers .
1 : 8 ; Ps .
Why should we be concerned about what we see , and what can we learn from the psalmist’s earnest request ?
The link between our sight and our mind is so strong that what we see with our eyes can initiate or intensify ambitions and desires in our heart .
It is no wonder , then , that the psalmist implored God : “ Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless ; preserve me alive in your own way . ” ​ — Ps .
How Our Eyes Can Mislead Us
Referring to them , Genesis 6 : 2 relates : “ The sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men , that they were good - looking ; and they went taking wives for themselves , namely , all whom they chose . ”
Centuries later , the Israelite Achan’s eyes seduced him into stealing some items from the captured city of Jericho .
The desire of his eyes led to his destruction , along with “ everything that was his . ”
A researcher in the United States who studied how advertising influences individuals stated that it is “ designed not just to convey cognitive information , but more importantly , to produce particular emotive and effectual responses . ”
How important it is , then , that we control what we look at and what we allow to enter into our mind and heart !
True Christians are not immune to the desire of the eyes and of the flesh .
So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin ? ”
( a ) Why must we be particularly wary when using the Internet ?
Even if a person gets only a glimpse before deleting it , the image has already made an impression on his mind .
Why are children especially vulnerable to pornography , and what may result from their viewing it ?
These effects , notes a report , may range from a distorted sense of sexual norms to “ difficulty maintaining a healthy , loving relationship ; an unrealistic view of women ; and potentially , pornography addiction , which can interfere with school work , friendships and family relationships . ”
Give an example to illustrate the danger of looking at pornography .
“ I still see these images at the oddest times ​ — triggered by a random smell , some music , something I see , or even a stray thought .
It is a daily and constant battle . ”
He wrote : “ What a horrible effect those pictures had on my young mind !
No matter how hard I fight , they are still there .
How wise it is to avoid having such burdensome feelings by not looking at worthless things !

( Read Psalm 11 : 5 . )
Even spending too much time viewing entertainment that may be considered acceptable can encroach on family worship , daily Bible reading , and our preparation for meetings . ​ — Phil .

What was noteworthy about Satan’s third temptation of Christ , and how was Jesus able to withstand it ?
Even Jesus had such things thrust upon him .
How did Jesus react ?
We can learn much from Jesus ’ example .
Third , Satan will exploit “ the desire of the eyes ” as much as he can in his attempt to lead us astray .
2 : 21 .
18 , 19 . ( a ) Contrast a “ simple ” eye with one that is “ wicked . ” ( b ) Why is it important to keep on considering what is valuable , and what advice does Philippians 4 : 8 give in this regard ?
Each day , we face a wide array of eye - appealing distractions , and their number keeps increasing .
A “ simple ” eye is totally focused on one purpose ​ — that of doing God’s will .
What must we do if we want to succeed in fulfilling Christ’s commission ?
( a ) Peter’s exclamation found at 2 Peter 3 : 11 , 12 emphasizes what need ?
Note this exclamation of the apostle Peter : “ What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion , awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah ! ”
Such deeds include the preaching of the good news .
Embrace God - Given Responsibilities
In his letter to the Christians in Jerusalem , the apostle Paul commended his fellow believers for their past record of faithful endurance even under persecution .
Yes , Jehovah remembered their faithful course .
12 : 25 .
After all , rendering sacred service is a matter of life and death . ​ — 1 Tim .
If we strive to continue to do God’s work with zeal , he will bless us and help us to go on prospering spiritually .

What is the point of Jesus ’ parable of the grand evening meal , and what lesson can we draw from it ?
The invited guests in Jesus ’ illustration gave excuses for not attending the feast .
Still another said : ‘ I cannot come .
We should never allow personal matters , such as those mentioned in Jesus ’ illustration , to become so important to us that they push aside our service to God .
To prevent that from happening , we live by Jesus ’ admonition : “ Keep on , then , seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness . ”
In fact , many have taken steps to simplify their lifestyle so that they can give more time to the ministry .
Please note some of the suggestions and scriptures listed in the box “ What Will Help You to Keep Following the Christ ? ”
Keeping busy in the ministry has a stabilizing effect on us , enriches our life , and brings us greater peace and happiness .
Make a Frank Appraisal
How can we determine what whole - souled service means for us personally ?
Individual circumstances vary .
( Compare Mark 12 : 41 - 44 . )
11 : 1 .
2 : 3 , 4 ; 2 Cor .
Whose examples can we imitate in being zealous followers of the Christ ?
About Peter and Andrew , who were fishing , we read : “ At once abandoning the nets , they followed him . ”
How did they react to Jesus ’ invitation ?
Although he had been a rabid persecutor of Christ’s followers , he changed course and became “ a chosen vessel ” to bear Christ’s name .
“ Immediately in the synagogues [ Paul ] began to preach Jesus , that this One is the Son of God . ”
4 : 10 .

What Will Help You to Keep Following the Christ ?
▪ Be conscious of the serious consequences of ‘ begging off . ’ ​ — Luke 9 : 59 - 62 .
Do You Let Jehovah Question You ?
At other times , a single question from Jehovah was enough to motivate a person to take positive action .
Upon hearing Jehovah ask : “ Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? ”
While some questions prompt a verbal reply , others are intended to stir a deeper reaction .
The Gospels record Jesus ’ extensive use of the latter kind .
“ He said to them : ‘ Why do you argue over your having no loaves ?
“ Though having eyes , do you not see ; and though having ears , do you not hear ? ” . . .
Jesus ’ questions called for a mental response , moving his disciples to reflect on the real meaning of his words . ​ — Mark 8 : 16 - 21 .
Did Jehovah expect an audible answer to each of those questions ?
Such questions as “ Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth ? ”
After some of that intensive questioning , Job was left nearly speechless .
Job got the point and humbled himself .
Gird up your loins , please , like an able - bodied man , and let me question you , and you inform me . ”
Allowing those questions to make us stop and think can bring us rich spiritual rewards .
As Jesus assured us , our heavenly Father , who feeds the birds of heaven and clothes the vegetation of the field , fully knows what we need . ​ — Matt .
6 : 7 .
“ Who are you to judge the house servant of another ? ”
May we allow every part of God’s Word , including its questions , to help us grow spiritually and “ see ” Jehovah ever more clearly !

Coping With Trials Strengthened Our Trust in Jehovah
When I left the hospital , Joel needed to stay behind to gain more weight .
Joel seems to have all the problems his brothers do not have . ”
Finally , the doctor looked up and said , “ Your child will be very dependent on you . ”
Further medical tests revealed that Joel also had a serious heart malformation and a severe form of rickets .
We wished we could hold him in our arms and caress him , but for ten distressing weeks , we were not allowed to touch him at all .
Every time I was able to share in the ministry , I felt that Jehovah answered my prayers .
Two months later , when he was about eight months old , the doctors ’ prediction seemed to come true , for Joel’s condition deteriorated .
There’s nothing more that we can do for him . ”
Then he added : “ At this point , only Jehovah can help him . ”
I returned to Joel’s hospital room .
She took me by the arm and said , “ Come , you can see him now . ”
Every year for the first seven years of Joel’s life , we dealt with the same sequence of events .
We were delighted , and we prayed together as a family to thank Jehovah from our hearts .
As Joel grew , we endeavored to make serving Jehovah a big part of his life .
We begged Jehovah to bless our efforts so that godly training would bear good fruit .
As he entered his early teens , we were grateful to notice that Joel loved to share Bible truths with those he met .
While he was recuperating from major surgery at age 14 , I felt so happy when Joel asked me , “ Mum , can I give the surgeon a Live Forever book ? ”
What an unforgettable day that was !
It took huge effort .
He also helps care for the microphones and performs other tasks .
What a kind blessing from Jehovah !
Again , by trusting in Jehovah , we felt the strength that he gives to his servants in need .
Although Luigi remains disabled , we try to look at the positive side .
This allows me to set aside more time for spiritual activities .
We hope that they may still return to Jehovah . ​ — Luke 15 : 17 - 24 .

Jacob counted on Jehovah for protection , but he also took practical steps to protect all who traveled with him .
Safety Under the Mosaic Law
22 : 8 .
If a bull killed a person by goring , the owner had to destroy the bull to keep other people safe .
But suppose that after a bull had injured a person , its owner did not keep the animal under guard .
The Law also encouraged the proper use of tools .
Many Israelites used axes to cut firewood .
Safety at Building Projects
But gray - headed workers ​ — those seasoned in the construction trades — ​ do detailed finish work with their hands and tools .
If you want to learn , brothers who are experienced in construction will teach you many things .
But you are protected only if you keep such equipment in good condition and wear it .
Although many tools appear simple to use , handling them safely and skillfully requires training and practice .
He will arrange for you to get proper training .
Modesty , or knowing your limitations , is a desirable quality .
Before climbing ladders or stepping on scaffolding , be sure that the equipment has all the safety features installed and is in good condition .
The Role of Love
It is love .
Yes , love for Jehovah moves us to treasure life , as he does .
And love for people keeps us from carelessly doing anything that could harm them .
Therefore , let us do our utmost to keep those on our building projects “ safe and sound . ”

◇ Do not use a ladder that is rickety or damaged , and do not repair such a ladder .
Have it destroyed .
◇ Always face the ladder when ascending or descending .
◇ When a ladder is used to get on or off a roof or landing , the side rails of the ladder should extend at least three feet [ 1 m ] above the roof or landing on which it rests .
Avoid such dangerous overreaching .
Move the ladder as often as necessary to keep it close to your work .

To illustrate : Imagine a small child who is upset because his father has gone to work .
Throughout the day , he repeatedly asks , “ Where is Daddy ? ”
We can readily detect the flaw in that child’s thinking .
Could our thinking be similarly flawed when we cry out , “ Where is God ” ?
For example , some might wish for God to be an executioner whose primary function is to bring swift punishment on the perpetrator of some wrong .
Imagine a house that has been a shambles for many years .
Now consider the damage that occurred to mankind some 6,000 years ago when an unseen spirit , Satan , induced Adam and Eve to rebel against God .
When they sinned , however , it was as if Adam and Eve vandalized the human family yet to be born .
Besides bringing death , sin has impaired our relationship with our Creator and has affected us physically , mentally , and emotionally .
Not at all !
Immediately after the rebellion in Eden , Jehovah God announced his purpose to restore mankind .
That practice foreshadowed a greater sacrifice that would be offered centuries later ​ — a sacrifice that would provide mankind with true redemption .
* The very layout of the tabernacle and temple at which the Israelites worshipped prefigured the steps that the future Messiah would take , from his sacrificial death to his ascension to heaven . ​ — See the chart on page 7 .
Before his ascension to heaven , Jesus commanded his followers : “ Make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit . . . And , look !
We know this because the sign that Jesus foretold regarding “ the conclusion of the system of things ” is now being fulfilled .
On page 2 of each issue of The Watchtower , you will find this comment : “ This magazine . . . comforts people with the good news that God’s Kingdom , which is a real government in heaven , will soon bring an end to all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise .

It is only natural that parents try to protect their children .
However , the situations described above actually presented an opportunity for those parents to teach their child a valuable lesson in responsibility .
Jesus was not a literal parent .
But his goal in choosing and training his disciples was to empower them to carry on the work , even after he was gone .
Consider just three aspects of the example Jesus set for parents .
He once said to them : “ I have many things yet to say to you , but you are not able to bear them at present . ”
For example , parents need to teach their children to be responsible for their own personal cleanliness , to clean their room , to be punctual , and to manage money wisely .
Parents need to do more than just assign responsibilities to their child .
They must also support the child’s efforts to succeed .
What specifically did he do ?
Then , either enforce the consequences or grant the rewards .
Jesus , like every good teacher , knew that the best way to learn is by doing .
However , he did not simply leave them to their own devices .
Before sending them out , he gave them very specific instructions .
Your first instinct may be to “ rescue ” your child or to take the burden upon yourself .
Instead of interfering , she decided to let Jenny deal directly with the teacher .
In most auditoriums , a stage serves as a teaching platform for the conducting of meetings .
Usually , seating is provided for between 100 and 300 people .
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the use of such items conflicts with the Bible’s command to “ flee from idolatry . ”
Many churches and temples are ornate and lavishly decorated .
So the name Kingdom Hall , which was coined in the 1930 ’ s , appropriately describes the purpose of these buildings ​ — to promote true worship and serve as a hub for the preaching of the “ good news of the kingdom . ”

Women , Why Submit to Headship ?
Do Not Grieve Jehovah’s Holy Spirit
Purpose of Study Articles
The second article explains how Christian women should view the statement : “ The head of a woman is the man . ”
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE :
Haran ​ — An Ancient Hive of Activity 20
Continue to Exercise Your Perceptive Powers 22
“ The head of every man is the Christ . ” ​ — 1 COR .
“ YOU are worthy , Jehovah , even our God , to receive the glory and the honor and the power , ” states Revelation 4 : 11 , “ because you created all things , and because of your will they existed and were created . ”
6 : 1 - 3 ; Heb .
12 : 22 , 23 .
Later , he came to earth as a perfect human and became known as Jesus Christ . ​ — Read John 1 : 1 - 3 , 14 .
The Christ is under the headship of his Father .
1 : 16 .
“ I always do the things pleasing to [ my Father ] , ” he declared .
He also demonstrated great love for people .
Sheeplike people of all ages , especially those who were downtrodden and oppressed , found great comfort in Jesus ’ delightful personality and uplifting message .
7 , 8 .
Throughout history , many men have treated women very badly .
Despite all that effort , she “ had got worse . ”
She touched Jesus and immediately got well .
On the contrary , he was kind to her .
He understood how she must have felt after all those years of illness and discerned that she was desperate for help .
Compassionately , Jesus told her : “ Daughter , your faith has made you well .
The Scriptural account tells us : “ At seeing this Jesus was indignant and said to [ the disciples ] : ‘ Let the young children come to me ; do not try to stop them , for the kingdom of God belongs to suchlike ones . ’ ”
Would Jesus have been able to do that had he not been submissive ?
All in the Christian congregation , especially the men , should continually work hard to imitate Christ’s qualities .
As already noted , the Bible declares : “ The head of every man is the Christ . ”
And the apostle Peter said : “ To this course you were called , because even Christ suffered for you , leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely . ”
The admonition to imitate the Christ is of particular interest to men for still another reason .
As Jesus found joy in imitating Jehovah , Christian men should find joy in imitating Christ and his qualities .
Peter gave the older men , or elders , this exhortation : “ Shepherd the flock of God in your care , not under compulsion , but willingly ; neither for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”
They need to ponder over the way that God and Christ deal with people and then strive to imitate them .
To what extent should elders show honor to others ?
In their dealings with God’s flock , the appointed men in the congregation are to exhibit fine qualities .
Elders and ministerial servants show honor to others .
By doing so , the appointed men will be following Paul’s counsel : “ We , though , who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong , and not to be pleasing ourselves .
For even the Christ did not please himself . ” ​ — Rom .
15 : 1 - 3 .
Consider now Peter’s counsel to married men .
To honor someone means to hold that individual in high esteem .
But what about women , wives in particular ?
Does submission to man’s headship require that the wife be a silent partner in marriage , having no say when decisions are made ?
“ I Am Going to Make a Helper for Him ”
( Read Romans 5 : 12 . )
But the headship arrangement remained in effect .
Often , it is the husband who is not a believer .
3 : 1 , 2 .
God’s Word tells the wife to maintain a submissive attitude toward the unbelieving husband .
With the help of God’s active force ​ — his holy spirit — ​ it is possible to maintain Christian qualities even under difficult circumstances .
God’s spirit enables the Christian mate to do many things that would not be possible otherwise .
Similarly , 1 Thessalonians 5 : 15 counsels us : “ See that no one renders injury for injury to anyone else , but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others . ”
With the backing of Jehovah’s holy spirit , what is impossible in our own strength becomes possible .
Not at all .
That number includes women .
Give an example to show that women prophesied .
Joel 2 : 28 , 29 foretold : “ I shall pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh , and your sons and your daughters will certainly prophesy . . . .
God’s spirit was poured out on this entire group .
Peter stated : “ This is what was said through the prophet Joel , ‘ And in the last days , ’ God says , ‘ I shall pour out some of my spirit upon every sort of flesh , and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . . . ; and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days , and they will prophesy . ’ ” ​ — Acts 2 : 16 - 18 .
And in sending greetings to fellow workers , Paul mentioned a number of faithful women , including “ Tryphaena and Tryphosa , women who are working hard in the Lord . ”
In our time , a large part of the more than seven million people preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom throughout the world are women of all ages .
The Scriptures mention several incidents in which wives spoke or acted even without their views being solicited by their husbands .
The Scriptures commend the wife who does things Jehovah’s way .
The Bible book of Proverbs praises “ a capable wife , ” saying : “ Her value is far more than that of corals .
Moreover , “ her mouth she has opened in wisdom , and the law of loving - kindness is upon her tongue .
Included in the fear of Jehovah is the need to submit willingly to the divine arrangement of headship .
( See box on page 17 . )
Always do things his way , and ‘ the joy of Jehovah will be your stronghold , ’ even in today’s troubled world . ​ — Neh .
8 : 10 .
Most important of all , their exemplary marriage will honor our praiseworthy God , Jehovah .
Why Show Respect for Authority ?
Jehovah has established among intelligent creatures arrangements for authority and headship .
The congregation of anointed Christians recognizes the authority and headship of Jesus Christ .
By doing so , we benefit ourselves as recipients of Jehovah’s approval and blessing . ​ — Isa .
Brothers ​ — Sow to the Spirit and Reach Out !
“ Therefore , beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest . ”
Jehovah God is answering such prayers in an unprecedented way .
A key factor is that you ‘ sow with a view to the spirit . ’
Because there is a great need for ministerial servants and elders today , this article is especially directed to Christian men .
( b ) How does one reach out ?
He must reach out for this “ fine work . ”
It includes serving fellow believers by genuinely caring for their needs .
Do I diligently care for the assignments entrusted to me by the elders ? ’
Another way to qualify for congregation responsibilities is to “ be made mighty in the man you are inside with power through [ God’s ] spirit . ”
How is spiritual growth achieved ?
One way is for you to “ keep walking by spirit ” and cultivating its fruitage .
It is evident that Paul put his heart into his work .
8 , 9 .
Our foremost example of a man who allowed God’s spirit to motivate him is Jesus Christ .
He willingly accepted his assignment to serve as mankind’s Redeemer .
When describing his feelings for the flock , one longtime elder said : “ Jesus ’ words to Peter ​ — shepherd my little sheep — ​ deeply move me .
Jehovah’s spirit will help you to cope with any concern you may have in this regard .
Therefore , it is fitting to ask Jehovah to help you to build a desire to accept privileges of service . ​ — Read Psalm 25 : 4 , 5 .
Or he may feel that he lacks sufficient wisdom to handle responsibilities .
In answer to Solomon’s prayer , God gave him “ a wise and understanding heart ” that enabled him to discern between good and bad when rendering judgment .
How is it that “ the love the Christ has compels us ” ?
As a result , we realize that it would be most unfitting for us to keep on ‘ sowing with a view to the flesh ’ by pursuing selfish goals and living largely to gratify ourselves .
This underscores the importance of the family’s role in supporting the husband and father as he seeks to serve the congregation’s interests as a ministerial servant or an elder . ​ — Read 1 Timothy 3 : 4 , 5 , 12 .
Jehovah is pleased when Christian family members cooperate with one another .
Were you told that you need to make some adjustments ?
Guard against becoming bitter .
An elder who had served for years but who lost his privileges of service stated : “ I was determined to maintain the same level of meeting attendance , field service , and Bible reading I had while serving as an elder ​ — a goal I was able to achieve .
145 : 1 , 2 ; Isa .
We therefore urge all baptized males to take a fresh look at their circumstances and ask themselves , ‘ If I am not a ministerial servant or an elder , should I analyze the reasons why I am not serving ? ’
When we engage in kind , unselfish acts , we reap the joy that comes from serving others and sowing with a view to the spirit .
How can that be avoided ?
See The Watchtower , August 15 , 2009 , pages 30 - 32 .
• How important is family cooperation if a man is to qualify to serve as a ministerial servant or an elder ?
What has Jehovah done for millions of people , and what duty do they have ?
What questions will we consider ?
But the apostle Paul gives us counsel and warns us not to grieve God’s holy spirit .
First of all , note Paul’s words recorded at Ephesians 4 : 30 .
He wrote : “ Do not be grieving God’s holy spirit , with which you have been sealed for a day of releasing by ransom . ”
How to Avoid Grieving the Spirit
We must be truthful .
Holy spirit helps us to resist Satan .
One way to resist him is by settling disputes quickly in harmony with Jesus ’ counsel . ​ — Matt .
He surely was not led by holy spirit .
We thus avoid grieving Jehovah’s holy spirit .
Just as we are repulsed by such food , we hate speech that Jehovah considers bad .
According to Ephesians 4 : 30 , 31 , we must rid ourselves of what ?
As imperfect humans , all of us need to work hard to control our thoughts and actions .
If we even begin to ignore the Bible’s counsel , we might develop traits that could lead to sinning against the spirit and we might experience disastrous consequences .
Paul wrote : “ Become kind to one another , tenderly compassionate , freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you . ”
Suppose a fellow believer has said something negative about us .
We forgive him , but we need to do more .
I am Jehovah . ” Vigilance Is Needed
First - century Jewish scribes sinfully ascribed Jesus ’ miracles to Satan .
But what if we have erred seriously ?
With God’s help , we can also avoid grieving the spirit again in any way .
Jehovah is willing and able to help us avoid grieving his spirit .
How Would You Answer ?
• In what ways can we avoid grieving the holy spirit ?
Which gods were worshipped , and how did the Romans view them ?
Why were Christians persecuted for refusing to sacrifice to the gods of Rome ?
Twice each day in Jerusalem’s temple , two lambs and an ox were sacrificed for Caesar and the Roman nation .
Paganism in a variety of forms was prevalent in local cults .
Popular in the early centuries C.E . were the cults of the Egyptian god Serapis and goddess Isis , the Syrian fish - goddess Atargatis , and the Persian sun - god Mithra .
In Lystra local people mistook Paul and Barnabas for the Greek gods Hermes and Zeus .
Supreme among Rome’s native gods was Jupiter , dubbed Optimus Maximus , the best and the greatest .
The Roman pantheon seemed endless .
Lares and Penates were family gods .
Pax safeguarded peace , Salus health , Pudicitia modesty and chastity , Fides fidelity , Virtus courage , and Voluptas pleasure .
For example , Zeus was depicted as a rapist and a pedophile who had sexual relations with mortals and supposed immortals .
They desired an institution that could overcome religious distinctions , promote patriotism , and unite the world under its “ savior . ”
The book of Revelation was penned during John’s exile .
Trajan praised Pliny’s handling of the cases brought before him and directed that Christians who refused to worship Roman gods be executed .
“ However , ” wrote Trajan , “ where the party denies he is a Christian , and shall make it evident that he is not , by invoking our gods , let him ( notwithstanding any former suspicion ) be pardoned upon his repentance . ”
Therefore , refusal to worship them was considered treason .
When it comes to ceremonies involving national flags , however , we are motivated by Jehovah God’s insistence on exclusive devotion and the counsel of his Word to “ flee from idolatry ” and “ guard [ ourselves ] from idols . ”

Noted for its endurance , this beautiful tree has received attention in several ways .
One outstanding way that they do this is by proclaiming the good news .
Just think of the countless hours such ones spend earnestly helping others to learn about the “ good news of the kingdom ” !
Among Jehovah’s servants today , we find excellent examples of faithful ones who have been ‘ walking with God ’ for decades .
As they continue applying Scriptural principles , their gray - headedness is indeed “ a crown of beauty . ” ​ — Prov .
In effect , Timothy was to “ rise up ” before gray hair .
Clearly , then , Jehovah expects our manner of speech to reflect such honor .
Overseers in the congregation certainly show honor to elderly Christians .
But all of us are to take the lead in showing honor to one another .
Surely , then , we should look for ways to help preserve the dignity of our aging parents and grandparents .
He does not abandon them .

Perhaps you have a close family member who suffers from a degenerative illness or from the effects of old age .
If you become spiritually weak , your emotional and physical health can also begin to suffer and you may be unable to provide the support your family member needs .
Maintain Balance ​ — How ?
“ Kim never complained that I was neglecting her by giving these responsibilities too much attention , ” notes Steve .
I continued serving as an elder , but by handing over to others some of my congregation responsibilities , I was able to give Kim the time and attention she needed . ”
Consider , too , the experience of Jerry , a traveling overseer , and his wife , Maria .
However , others in the congregation can and should provide practical assistance .
Jehovah Appreciates Your Efforts
Caring for a sick relative can certainly be taxing .
Why can those who care for ailing or suffering ones be happy ?
How good it is to know that Jehovah God notices and approves of what we do in caring for a sick relative !

After his father died , Abraham continued on his journey to the land that the true God had promised .
The designation “ Haran ” here referred not only to the city but to the surrounding district as well .
27 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
According to inscriptions unearthed in Haran , the mother of King Nabonidus of Babylon was the high priestess at the temple of Sin , the moon god of Haran .
Ancient Haran was a highly developed and important city , especially during certain periods .
Present - day Haran , however , is only a collection of houses with domed roofs .

Both he and the people benefited from Jehovah’s great mercy .
Some found it hard to leave traditional practices associated with the weekly Sabbath and the annual Atonement Day .
Exercise Your Perceptive Powers
Would that not be disheartening ?
We exercise our thinking ability “ through use ”
Is It Really Dishonest ?
Some people seem to have clever “ solutions ” for everything .
You may feel as did the apostle Paul , who wrote : “ We trust we have an honest conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ”
While driving one day , a young woman named Lisa * makes a mistake and collides with another car .
What should she do ?
But a more important reason to avoid being dishonest is found in God’s Word .
“ You must not steal , ” states one of the Ten Commandments .
His accountant suggests that he claim a tax deduction for the “ purchase ” of expensive computer equipment .
Such a purchase is normal for a business like Peter’s .
On the other hand , if the law of the land grants reduced tax rates to certain individuals or businesses , there is nothing wrong with claiming such benefits if legally qualified to do so .
Because David is interested in pleasing God , how should he view work that is done off the books ?
Jesus commanded : “ Pay back , therefore , Caesar’s things to Caesar , but God’s things to God . ”
Governmental authorities , whom Jesus called Caesar , consider tax payments their rightful due .
Jehovah God knows what we do and will call us to account for our actions .
What Will You Do ?
Lisa , Gregor , Peter , David , and Marta saw the seriousness of the circumstances they faced .
“ Let the stealer steal no more . ”
To gain God’s approval , we pay all taxes required by law

That is especially so in the light of the questionable conduct and unscriptural teachings of their religious leaders .
( b ) What will we consider ?
( Read Isaiah 65 : 13 , 14 ; Malachi 3 : 18 . )
4 : 6 , 7 .
“ My Feet Had Almost Turned Aside ”
Taking such a stand has not always been easy .
The psalmist asked why it is that the wicked often seem to be successful , happy , and prosperous , while some who strive to serve God suffer trials and hardships . ​ — Read Psalm 73 : 1 - 13 .
Have you ever found yourself asking questions like the ones the psalmist recorded ?
Indeed , all who desire to serve Jehovah must come to grips with and accept the answer to this problem : Is serving and obeying God the best thing to do ?
That , of course , is exactly what Satan would like us to do .
What helped the psalmist overcome his doubts ?
Although he admitted nearly turning aside from righteousness , his viewpoint changed when he entered “ the grand sanctuary of God ” ​ — that is , when he associated with spiritual people in God’s tabernacle or temple and reflected on God’s purpose .
He found security and wisdom among God’s people .
Similarly today , we can find wise counselors and enjoy wholesome spiritual food at congregation meetings .
Do you suppose Dinah ever imagined that such a thing could happen to her ?
On the other hand , association with people who share your beliefs , your high moral standards , and your love for Jehovah is a safeguard .
Some had been fornicators , idolaters , adulterers , homosexuals , thieves , drunkards , and so on .
How has living by Bible standards changed the lives of many ?
People who have no faith lack sound guiding principles .
Yet , they were unsatisfied and unhappy .
They found peace only when they began associating with God’s people and living in accord with Bible principles .
She now says : “ The three years I spent away from the congregation left ugly scars on my emotions that will not go away .
35 : 18 .
• What do we learn from the experiences of the writer of Psalm 73 ?
Your reliance on his Word as a guide shields you from the bad consequences of an unchristian lifestyle .
Others are sick or depressed , or they may be suffering the consequences of unwise decisions .
And we all have to live in an ungodly world .
None of us like to see fellow Christians suffer or struggle .
“ As he was aglow with the spirit , ” says the Acts account , “ he went speaking and teaching with correctness the things about Jesus , but being acquainted with only the baptism of John . ”
Though Apollos was zealous , there were some significant gaps in his knowledge .

Of course , Aquila and Priscilla would have approached Apollos in a tactful and helpful manner , not making him feel that he was being criticized .
It was simply a matter of his not being aware of the history of the early Christian congregation .
And Apollos was no doubt grateful to his new companions for sharing these important details with him .
Many in the Christian congregation today are very grateful to those who helped them to understand the Bible .
Numerous enduring friendships have been formed between students and their teachers .
In most cases , helping people to understand the truth requires scheduling regular conversations with them over a period of several months .
However , Kingdom publishers are willing to make that sacrifice because they recognize that it is a question of life and death .
And what a joy it is to see people grasp the truth , live in accord with it , and use their lives to do Jehovah’s will !
( b ) What progress was Timothy helped to make ?

8 , 9 .
Look around in your congregation !
How did Epaphroditus feel , and why ?
Feeling that he had failed in his mission , Epaphroditus got depressed . ​ — Phil .
What could the Philippians do to help Epaphroditus ?
2 : 29 , 30 .
What can be a source of comfort to the depressed ?
“ Kindly Forgive and Comfort Him ”
13 , 14 . ( a ) What serious action did the Corinthian congregation take , and why ?
The first - century Corinthian congregation faced the situation of a man who unrepentantly practiced fornication .
What do we learn from this account ?
They may have brought dishonor upon God’s name and discredited the congregation .
Yet , when the elders appointed to examine the case determine , in line with Jehovah’s direction , that a repentant sinner ought to be readmitted to the congregation , it indicates that he has been forgiven by Jehovah .
But at a certain point in their journey and for a reason not specified , John Mark left his companions and returned home .
In view of what had happened on the first journey , Paul did not want Mark to travel with them . ​ — Read Acts 13 : 1 - 5 , 13 ; 15 : 37 , 38 .
Evidently , Mark did not allow himself to become overly discouraged by Paul’s rejection , for he continued his missionary activity in a different territory along with Barnabas .
[ Picture on page 12 ]
A GROUP of 34 of Jehovah’s Witnesses were traveling to a branch office dedication when mechanical trouble delayed their flight along the way .
3 , 4 . ( a ) How and for how long has violent anger afflicted humans ?
Explain .
Often , this anger leads to hatred and outright violence .
Wars rage between and within countries , while family tensions bring conflict right into many homes .
Cain committed this vile deed even though Jehovah had urged him to control his emotions and had promised to bless him if he did . ​ — Read Genesis 4 : 6 - 8 .
And other powerful negative forces add stress in these “ critical times . ”
( Read Matthew 5 : 39 , 44 , 45 . )
They felt that Shechem had offended them and their father , Jacob .
Simeon and Levi still tried to justify their actions , saying : “ Ought anyone to treat our sister like a prostitute ? ”
Many years later , Jacob foretold that because of the violent , angry acts of Simeon and Levi , their descendants would be scattered among the tribes of Israel .
A wealthy man named Nabal screamed abuses at David’s men , though they had protected Nabal’s flocks and shepherds .
She humbly apologized for Nabal’s insolence and appealed to David’s fear of Jehovah .
Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil , but keep conquering the evil with the good . ” ​ — Rom .
How did one sister learn to deal with anger ?
However , when problems occur with a spiritual brother or sister , the pain can be much deeper .
We came out of a cold , uncaring world , hoping that all in the congregation would treat one another with Christian kindness .
Why and how should we work to overcome differences ?
How much more should we pray for our spiritual brothers and sisters !
Therefore , let us resolve problems or simply “ pass over ” transgression and move ahead together .
Instead of drawing away from our brothers when problems arise , we ought to help one another remain among God’s people , safe in the embrace of Jehovah’s “ everlasting arms . ” ​ — Deut .
To hinder us from spreading the good news , Satan and the demons are actively trying to disrupt happy families and congregations .
In combating their evil influence , we do well to follow Paul’s counsel : “ A slave of the Lord does not need to fight , but needs to be gentle toward all . ”
Others slander us in the press or in the courts .
How should we react ?
We must never “ return evil for evil , ” in word or in deed . ​ — Rom . 12 : 17 ; read 1 Peter 3 : 16 .
At that , a policeman exclaimed : “ But we told you this morning ! ”
The board also thanked Jehovah’s Witnesses for their patient handling of a difficult situation .
[ Footnote ]
Can You Explain ?
• How should we react if a fellow Christian hurts us ?
1 , 2 .
I assured the family that I had come in peace and wished to go in peace .
The man had a jug of cool water and offered me a drink .
Because the brother controlled himself and spoke graciously , the outcome was good .
Why is it important to use gracious speech ?
Whether we are dealing with those outside or those inside the congregation , even with family members , it is vital to follow the apostle Paul’s counsel : “ Let your utterance be always with graciousness , seasoned with salt . ”
After 40 years of leading the Israelites , Moses did not have the privilege of taking them into the Promised Land . ​ — Num .
“ A Time to Keep Quiet and a Time to Speak ”
will be liable to the fiery Gehenna . ” ​ — Matt .
19 : 17 ; Matt .
There is “ a time to keep quiet and a time to speak . ”
Doing so when one is still very upset could make matters worse ; but neither is it wise to wait a long time .
It can even “ heap fiery coals ” on a person and may bring out good qualities , making it easier to talk things out . ​ — Rom .
Esau came out to meet him , along with 400 men .
27 : 41 - 44 ; 32 : 6 , 11 , 13 - 15 ; 33 : 4 , 10 .
Encourage Others With Gracious Speech
Our gracious words can lighten the load of our brothers and sisters .
Harsh criticism , however , can make those loads feel heavier and even cause some to wonder if they have lost Jehovah’s approval .
They should be kind and tactful , in line with what we read at Matthew 7 : 12 .
Parents and children likewise should speak to one another with graciousness .
When talking to younger ones , thoughtfulness will help us to avoid “ exasperating ” them or ‘ provoking them to wrath . ’
That is so much better than conveying the impression that we have given up on them , whereupon they may give up on themselves .
Younger ones might not remember all the counsel they received , but they will remember how others spoke to them .
Speaking Good Things From the Heart
How can we get rid of hurtful thoughts and feelings ?
Trying to remain calm on the outside while boiling with anger on the inside puts us under strain .
That puts the car under extra stress and can cause damage .
If you find yourself in a tense situation and you sense anger building inside you , it may help to leave the scene , thus giving your emotions time to settle .
A cutting or aggressive remark would add fuel to the fire even if it is delivered in a gentle voice .
Forgiving From the Heart
Applying the practical principles in God’s Word will help us to use our tongue to do good , not bad .
• How can we avoid saying hurtful things ?
Find Refreshment in Spiritual Things
Keeping the Sabbath allowed family heads time to teach their family to “ keep Jehovah’s way to do righteousness . ”
More important , the Sabbath prophetically pointed forward to a time when true refreshment would come through Christ’s Millennial Reign .
But what about our day ?
In what way did first - century Christians support one another , and with what result ?
There we find an “ interchange of encouragement . . . each one through the other’s faith . ”
Our Christian brothers and sisters are not mere passing acquaintances , superficial associates with whom we casually meet now and again .
7 .
One way to get acquainted with our brothers and sisters is to give of ourselves at a convention .
After helping to assist at an international convention , one sister remarked : “ Except for my family and a handful of friends , I didn’t know many there .
But when I helped with the cleaning , I met a lot of brothers and sisters !
It was great fun ! ”
( b ) What can contribute to a memorable and upbuilding gathering ?
Wise King Solomon declared : “ With a man there is nothing better than that he should eat and indeed drink and cause his soul to see good because of his hard work . ”
This is evident in his words : “ The harvest is great , but the workers are few .
This was in stark contrast with the burdensome rules that the Pharisees imposed on the people . ​ — Read Matthew 23 : 4 , 23 , 24 .
Does our success in the ministry depend upon receiving a positive response to our message ?
Explain .
If you live in an area where there is limited response to the Kingdom message , try to focus on the good that you are accomplishing in the ministry .
What responsibility has Jehovah given parents , and how can they fulfill it ?
Godly parents are responsible for instructing their children about Jehovah and his ways .
This is an evening set aside each week for family Bible study .
Many have found that this arrangement has drawn them closer together in love and has strengthened their relationship with Jehovah .
For example , one family allowed their ten - year - old son , Brandon , to present a report entitled “ Why Did Jehovah Use a Snake to Represent Satan ? ”
Some families have occasionally put on Bible dramas , with each member of the family playing a character , reading his part from the Bible , or acting out an event .
Even those who have a job often feel that the money they earn is carried home in a pocket full of holes , resulting in little benefit to their family .
38 : 4 .
By having full faith in the ransom provision of Christ , we put ourselves in Jehovah’s hands , so to speak .
In this way , we obtain “ power beyond what is normal . ”
1 : 2 - 4 .
Genuine Christians today need to guard against being unduly influenced by the pleasure - mad spirit of this world .
( Read Ephesians 2 : 2 - 5 . )

Yet , we do not allow such things to become our primary focus in life .
1 : 8 .
In doing so , we will find true happiness and refreshment !

How Would You Answer ?
[ Pictures on page 26 ]
In all , 13,235 , united in their love of Jehovah , enjoyed the three - hour meeting .
The audience was invited to sing three new songs at the meeting ; the chorus sang them first , and then the chorus and the audience sang them together .
Viv Mouritz from the Australia branch told of developments in East Timor , which is cared for by the brothers in Australia .
Later , members of the other sheep class were appointed as helpers .
Six of them were interviewed .
This committee responds to major emergencies , persecution , court cases , disasters , and other urgent matters affecting Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide .
Next , Robert Wallen , who has served at Bethel for nearly 60 years , told how the Service Committee supervises the activity of Jehovah’s people in the field and in the congregations .
William Malenfant outlined the hard work the Teaching Committee does to prepare a convention program .
*
Principled love is extended not only to our neighbors but also to our enemies .
The audience was encouraged to consider what Jesus went through for us , being flogged , mocked , spit upon , and pierced .
Are You Running on Empty ?
Figuratively , we need to keep a full tank , the fuel being our knowledge of Jehovah .
Fourth , quiet , undisturbed meditation , thinking about Jehovah’s ways .
He referred to Matthew 24 : 34 , which says : “ This generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur . ”
In the United States alone , there are over 86,000 elders .
These would then be moved to Brooklyn to teach , and four more would be trained .
They would then teach the school in Brooklyn , and the original four would teach the school in Assembly Halls and Kingdom Halls .
The annual meeting opened with singing from our new songbook , “ Sing to Jehovah ”
All the while , I thought that there had to be something I could do to make my husband love me .
When he finally left me and our daughter , I felt that I had failed , that I should have done or said more to hold the marriage together . ”
However , Jehovah did not hold Jesus accountable for Judas ’ actions .
An inspired psalmist realistically wrote : “ If errors were what you watch , O Jah , O Jehovah , who could stand ? ”
If a marriage mate establishes a record of abusive speech or actions , it is the guilty party who must answer to Jehovah .
He knows your need for comfort and encouragement .
One of the ways Jehovah provides comfort is through the Christian congregation .
The Bible verses and his kind comments helped relieve my feelings of guilt and provided me with some peace of mind . ”
Margarita , mentioned earlier , also learned that Jehovah provides practical help through the Christian congregation .
I explained my situation , and we cried together .
She immediately arranged for us to attend the meeting that day .
By such practical assistance , members of the congregation are helping to ‘ carry the burdens of one another ’ and in so doing are fulfilling “ the law of the Christ . ” ​ — Gal .
If allowed to fester , this resentment may undermine your resolve to stay faithful to Jehovah .
If you realize that such feelings are pent - up within you , you might reflect on the example of Joshua and Caleb .
Some of the Israelites even wanted to pelt Joshua and Caleb with stones when they tried to encourage the nation to remain faithful .
As a result of Israel’s actions , Joshua and Caleb were forced to wander in the wilderness for 40 years , not for their own error , but for the error of others .
14 : 6 - 12 .
“ The meetings were also a great source of strength .
My family have drawn closer to one another and to the congregation .
You too can cope with similar trials .
Despite the pain caused by a betrayal , strive to follow Paul’s inspired counsel : “ Let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out . ” ​ — Gal .
But he who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in it , this man , because he has become , not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , will be happy in his doing it . ” ​ — James 1 : 23 - 25 .
Perhaps he only glanced at himself , or maybe he lacked the desire to make any changes .
In contrast , we can gain true happiness if we peer into the Bible with the idea of becoming “ a doer , ” allowing God’s thinking to mold our thoughts and actions .
Step 2 ​ — Select a Reliable Translation
Certain translations even change the Bible’s pure message by relying on traditions .
Millions of readers the world over have found that the New World Translation does just that .
You can also express thanks for the Bible , for without it we would not know God . ​ — Psalm 119 : 62 .
Consider what happened to two teenage sisters in Uruguay .
* The teenage sisters were convinced that God had answered their prayer for help .
No .
• Joseph : Genesis 37 - 50 .
Read aloud .
Doing so helped him to develop a deep love for what he learned .
The book of Acts describes an Ethiopian official who was perplexed by a portion of the Bible that he read .
[ Footnotes ]
The book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
How reasonable is it that we should expect to understand all of God’s ways ?
The concept of God’s being without a beginning is apparently one of them .
Here Moses describes God’s existence as stretching in two directions .
One is toward the future .
Jehovah is “ the One that lives forever and ever . ”
The other is toward the past .
It is therefore fitting that only God bears the unique title “ King of eternity . ”
Just think : Jesus Christ , the myriads of angels in heaven , and mankind on earth all have a beginning because of being created .
Keep in mind , though , that the concept of God’s eternal existence is not just a cold fact .
1 KINGS 14 : 13
Jehovah looks for the good in our hearts even though we are far from perfect .
His father , Jeroboam , was the head of an apostate dynasty .
Abijah exhibited this goodness even though he was “ in the house of Jeroboam . ”
Most important , the words of 1 Kings 14 : 13 teach us something beautiful about Jehovah and what he looks for in us .

We will consider what we must avoid and what we must do to be prepared for Jehovah’s great day .
This article considers what we personally can do to benefit fully from the role that God’s spirit plays in helping us to understand his Word .
“ Continue Applying Yourself . . . to Teaching ” 29
Alertness Leads to Fine Results 32
“ Jehovah’s day will come as a thief , . . . and earth and the works in it will be discovered . ” ​ — 2 PET .
1 , 2 . ( a ) How will the present wicked system of things end ?
Can anything founded on falsehood stand forever ?
And what did Peter mean by the “ earth and the works in it ” being “ discovered ” ?
“ The heavens [ that ] will pass away ” represent human rule over ungodly society .
“ The Elements . . .
Will Be Dissolved ”
A Bible dictionary defines “ elements ” as “ first principles , ” or “ rudiments . ”
Thus , “ the elements ” mentioned by Peter refer to the fundamental things that give the world its ungodly characteristics , attitudes , ways , and goals .
“ The elements ” include “ the spirit of the world , ” which “ operates in the sons of disobedience . ”
*
( a ) What should we reject , and why ?
Read 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
This celestial city will ‘ come down out of heaven ’ by directing its attention to the earth .
The “ new earth ” refers to the new earthly society of humans who will have demonstrated their willing submission to God’s Kingdom .
Prepare for Jehovah’s Great Day
Even true Christians , who are keeping in expectation of that day , will be surprised by its suddenness .
5 : 3 .
‘ We have heard that same reminder for decades , ’ they may say .
Trust in the God of Salvation
We need to develop qualities that please Jehovah and perform works that are acceptable to him . ​ — 2 Pet .
the ‘ new heavens and new earth ’ ?
3 : 11 .
As revealed by Peter , Satan tried to corrupt God’s people by means of false teachers who had “ eyes full of adultery ” and “ a heart trained in covetousness . ”
Accordingly , Peter’s second letter is a heartfelt exhortation to faithfulness .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What exclamation did Peter make , and what warning did he give ?
After mentioning the dissolution of Satan’s world , Peter stated : “ What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion ! ”
Thus , the apostle added : “ You , therefore , beloved ones , having this advance knowledge , be on your guard that you may not be led away with them [ false teachers ] by the error of the law - defying people and fall from your own steadfastness . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 17 .
Later , the apostle John clearly explained why .
But what about us individually ?
True , it takes “ earnest effort ” to share in activities that help us cultivate godly qualities .
Concerning the family worship arrangement , a sister writes : “ It allows us to learn about so many subjects . ”
A family head states : “ Family worship helps us tremendously .
Having a meeting tailored to our specific needs as a couple is great !
Still , be determined not to cancel your Family Worship evening ​ — not even for one week !
Why must we do our utmost to remain “ spotless and unblemished , ” and what does that require of us ?
Therefore , we are not surprised that the world has become obsessed with things that Jehovah detests , such as greed , sexual depravity , and violence .
Hence , we must take to heart Peter’s loving admonition : “ Do your utmost to be found finally by [ God ] spotless and unblemished and in peace . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
Exerting ourselves includes protecting our heart from being overtaken by wrong desires .
4 : 4 .
We can hope to succeed only if we turn to Jehovah , who generously gives holy spirit to those sincerely asking him .
That spirit , in turn , nurtures within us qualities that merit God’s approval and that help us to cope not only with life’s temptations but also with its trials , which may well increase as Jehovah’s day draws near .
But instead of becoming downhearted , why not view trials as an opportunity to confirm your love for God and to refine your faith in him and his Word ?
The disciple James wrote : “ Consider it all joy , my brothers , when you meet with various trials , knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance . ”
Consider the example of Jacob’s son Joseph , who was sold into slavery by his own brothers .
Later , he was falsely accused of attempted rape and was imprisoned .
What can we learn from the example of Naomi ?
Other faithful servants of God certainly did .
Consider Naomi , who lost both her husband and her two sons .
“ The former things will not be called to mind , neither will they come up into the heart . ” ​ — Isa .
Though Satan will not stop trying to discourage us , he will fail if we remain “ sound in mind ” and “ vigilant with a view to prayers . ”
Only those standing in an approved condition will have the prospect of surviving Jehovah’s day .
Think of this : As a direct result of our preaching work , God’s enemies will not be able to plead ignorance when they come face - to - face with him during his great day .
Indeed , like Pharaoh of old , they will know that it is Jehovah who is acting against them .
At the same time , Jehovah will honor his faithful servants by making it abundantly clear that they were , indeed , his representatives . ​ — Read Ezekiel 2 : 5 ; 33 : 33 .
How ?
In so doing , we put ourselves in line for the endless blessings associated with the ‘ new heavens and new earth . ’ ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 13 .
Have a Full Share in the Great Spiritual Harvest
Jesus was referring , not to a literal harvest , but to a spiritual ingathering of righthearted individuals who would become his followers .
Jesus ’ words about a harvest have special meaning for our day .
Yearly , millions of people receive the invitation to take in life - giving truths , and many thousands of new disciples are baptized .
Let us consider these qualities one at a time .
Humility Is Essential
Picture the scene : The disciples have just argued about who is the greatest .
To this day , many in the world dedicate their lives to the pursuit of power , wealth , and position .
In contrast , Jehovah’s people are happy to ‘ make themselves small ’ in the eyes of others in order to win the blessing and approval of the Master of the harvest . ​ — Matt .
11 : 7 ; Phil .
“ When I later got engaged to be married , ” he recalls , “ I could have found a job that would have brought my wife and me greater financial security .
Francisco concludes : “ For more than 30 years , I have enjoyed the privilege of serving as an elder , in addition to many other special assignments .
He took away the talent that he had given to the third slave and expelled that slave from his household . ​ — Matt .
No doubt your heart’s desire is to imitate the diligent slaves in Jesus ’ parable and have as full a share as possible in the disciple - making work .
If that is the case , the parable of the talents contains an encouraging message for you .
Note that the master in the parable recognized that each of his slaves had different potential .
As expected , the first slave produced significantly more than the second slave .
Her job as a maid involved working long hours and making tiring journeys in packed urban transportation .
When you carefully apply the practical suggestions presented at the weekly Service Meeting , you will hone your preaching skills and explore new witnessing opportunities .
Keep in mind that diligence springs from an appreciative heart .
Earlier , Jesus too had spoken of the cleansing power of the word of God , which he proclaimed .
Only if we allow God’s truth to cleanse us in this way will our worship be acceptable to him .
This involves reading the Bible and attending Christian meetings .
It also means making a sincere effort to apply God’s reminders in our life .
Comparing his anointed disciples to the branches of a vine , Jesus stated : “ Every branch in me not bearing fruit [ my Father ] takes away , and every one bearing fruit he cleans , that it may bear more fruit . ”
While many suffer the pain and frustration that accompany this world’s materialistic and pleasure - seeking lifestyle , we experience genuine joy and contentment .
• why is it essential to display humility ?
Humility can help us to lead a simple life that centers on Kingdom interests
“ The spirit searches into all things , even the deep things of God . ” ​ — 1 COR .
2 : 10 .
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 9 - 12 . )
Jesus indicated a twofold way in which the spirit would operate .
What words of Jesus indicated that “ the deep things of God ” would be revealed progressively ?
Jesus himself taught his disciples many truths that were new to them .
They still had much to learn , however .
However , when that one arrives , the spirit of the truth , he will guide you into all the truth . ”
Onlookers were witnessing the fulfillment in a way none of them had expected , and the apostle Peter took the lead in explaining this development .
Could Gentiles also be accepted into it and be anointed with holy spirit ?
Jehovah’s spirit was needed to search into these deep things .
Peter , Paul , and Barnabas were at that meeting of the governing body and recounted how Jehovah had been dealing with uncircumcised Gentiles .
Many other matters were clarified through the inspired writings of John , Peter , James , and Paul .
During the Time of the End
13 : 38 .
The very prophecy Daniel recorded was “ sealed up ” until that time .
As time goes on , further clarifications may be needed , and these too are honestly explained . ​ — See the box “ How the Spirit Revealed the Meaning of the Spiritual Temple . ”
Like the first - century Christians , we today study and later recall and apply information that the holy spirit helps us to understand .
We do not need extensive formal education in order to comprehend deep spiritual truths that have been published .
This is true even if we are alone or the time we have available is short .
13 , 14 .
What role does preparing for meetings play in understanding the deep things of God ?
The “ slave ” fulfills its assignment by supplying Scriptural material and by arranging programs for study and meetings .
2 : 29 .
Keep up - to - date .
Some published material is not reviewed at our meetings , but it is prepared for our benefit .
Even issues of our journals that are offered to the public are prepared with us in mind .
2 : 2 .
The understanding we acquire becomes part of the personal treasure we can draw from as we need to . ​ — Matt .
What do you consider during Family Worship evenings ?
Some read the Bible , researching verses that raise questions in their mind and making brief explanatory notes in their Bible .
Many families take time to make family application of the material studied .
Certain family heads select material that they feel the family needs to consider or that deals with subjects or questions the family has asked to consider .
• Through whom did the holy spirit reveal deep truths in the first century ?
“ The true tent ” came into existence in 29 C.E . when Jesus was baptized and Jehovah accepted him as the one to become a perfect sacrifice .
Rather , anointed Christians are serving in the courtyard and in the Holy of the spiritual temple , daily offering to God “ a sacrifice of praise . ” ​ — Heb .
However , just before that warning , Jesus stated : “ Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer . ”
We will also look at some modern - day examples of faithful fellow believers who ‘ stood firm against the machinations of the Devil . ’ ​ — Eph .
6 : 11 - 13 .
Flushed with confidence , he then set his sights on Jehovah’s people and their capital city , Jerusalem , where God - fearing Hezekiah ruled as king .
No doubt , Satan was exploiting the situation , inciting Sennacherib to carry out his plans so that true worship could be annihilated from the earth . ​ — Gen .
What methods did Rabshakeh use in his efforts to put fear in the hearts of the Jews ?
Rabshakeh told Hezekiah’s representatives : “ This is what the great king , the king of Assyria , has said : ‘ What is this confidence in which you have trusted ? . . . Look !
You are on your own ​ — isolated . ’
I remembered the assurance at Isaiah 66 : 2 , that God looks ‘ to the one afflicted and contrite in spirit . ’
Likewise , a brother who spent years in solitary confinement said : “ I came to realize that the small rectangle of a cell could also be a universe when one enjoys an intimate relationship with God . ”
8 : 35 - 39 .
We should regularly ask ourselves : ‘ How real is Jehovah to me ?
Hence , to prepare ourselves to be able to think clearly when under pressure , we need to give priority to daily Bible reading and personal study .
Indeed , if we carefully study God’s Word and the publications provided by the slave class today , then , at critical moments in life , holy spirit will “ bring back to [ our ] minds ” what we have learned . ​ — John 14 : 26 .
Rabshakeh tried to intimidate the Jews .
That was surely the case with the Nazi persecutors during World War II .
“ Then you are the next one to be shot , ” the officer threatened .
18 : 10 .
We also need to make good use of the faith - strengthening arrangements provided by the faithful slave class .
Like a diamond , harder than flint , I have made your forehead . ”
If needed , Jehovah can help us to be as diamond - hard as Ezekiel had to be .
Rabshakeh also employed this method .
The prospect of eating fresh bread and drinking new wine must have been very appealing to those cooped up behind the besieged city’s walls !
However , the brother remained spiritually alert and did not compromise his Christian principles .
What helped him ?
He later explained : “ I used to think about the Kingdom as the real hope . . . .
How real is God’s Kingdom to us ?
4 : 16 - 18 .
Despite all of Rabshakeh’s efforts to frighten the Jews , Hezekiah and his subjects put their unwavering trust in Jehovah .
Jehovah , in turn , answered their prayers for help by sending an angel to strike down in one night 185,000 warriors in the camp of the Assyrians .
Though knowing how to read is not a requirement for salvation , the Bible does associate reading with great spiritual benefits .
Why ?
So how can parents nurture in their children a thirst for beneficial knowledge ?
That way , books become their friends and a part of their life . ”
When you read such publications with your children , you expose them not only to language but also to “ spiritual matters ” and “ spiritual words . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
2 : 13 .
Be enthusiastic , and they will be too .
To your delight , your young children will soon be able to recognize , pronounce , and grasp the meaning of many words .
You may want to pose questions yourself and suggest possible answers .
Never forget , though , that reading is a complex skill .
It calls for the ability to organize , remember , and make use of information .
10 : 10 .
This will help her to grasp its meaning and remember it .
Good ventilation and lighting , along with a quiet and comfortable setting , make concentration easier .
Of course , the way parents view study is crucial .
“ It is very important for you to be regular and consistent in making time for reading and study , ” observes one mother .
According to one authority , this approach is a major influence in teaching children good study habits .
Finally , help your children see the practical benefits of study .
It would take volumes to list all the positive benefits of instilling a love for reading in your children .
As parents dedicate time and attention to their children and do everything possible to give them a good start in life , they hope that their children will eventually choose to become worshippers of Jehovah .
By all means , then , prayerfully seek Jehovah’s blessing as you strive to incite in your children a love for reading and studying . ​ — Prov .
February 22 , 1997 , pages 3 - 10 .

• Discuss what you read
○ concentrate
• Create circumstances that promote study
Later , the apostle Paul also emphasized the importance of being teachers of God’s Word .
Gospel writer Luke recorded : “ They all began to give favorable witness about him and to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth . ”
No wonder Paul was greatly disturbed !

Establish Common Ground
Paul was positive in his message .
Paul continued , saying : “ The God that made the world and all the things in it , being , as this One is , Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in handmade temples , neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything , because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things . ” ​ — Acts 17 : 24 , 25 .
By the way we teach , we can exemplify the kind of God we worship .

For example , Paul’s illustration in his letter to the Hebrews is equally convincing today : “ Every house is constructed by someone , but he that constructed all things is God . ”
Paul stated : “ True , God has overlooked the times of such ignorance , yet now he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent .
“ Well , when they heard of a resurrection of the dead , some began to mock , while others said : ‘ We will hear you about this even another time . ’
Some respond to our teaching immediately ; others may require more time to be convinced by our reasoning .
But when our clear and simple explanation of the truth helps even one individual come to an accurate knowledge of Jehovah , how grateful we are to be used by God to draw people to his Son ! ​ — John 6 : 44 .

‘ Are we too late ? ’
the brothers wondered .
‘ Did they leave Turku ? ’
But then , one worker dressed in overalls came around the corner .
Before long , a swarm of workers had gathered near the stop .
Some workers said that they had been contacted by Witnesses before in other parts of the world .
Are you alert to opportunities that may unexpectedly arise in your congregation territory ?
STX Europe

She says : “ My husband is a man of few words .
That irritates me !
Why are men so difficult to understand ?
Certainly .
For example , Liam , who lives in Europe , says : “ Where I come from , people tend to be tactless .
My blunt way of expressing myself often upset my wife .
The counsel that the apostle Paul gave a missionary is also helpful for newlyweds .
For example , Antonio , a husband in Italy , says : “ My father hardly ever consulted my mother about family decisions .
So at first , I ruled my family as if I were a monarch . ”
What do you think ​ — if a husband treats his wife like a child , is he honoring the marriage arrangement ?
When discussing challenging issues , learn to attack the problem ​ — not your husband’s character .
Rather than attack him personally , she expressed herself tactfully .
TRY THIS : Rather than taking note of ways in which you feel your spouse ought to change , keep a changes - I - need - to - make list .
Husbands : When you upset your wife by the way you exercise or fail to exercise your headship , ask her how you can improve , and then write the suggestion down .
Wives : When your husband feels that he is not being shown respect , ask him how you can improve , and take note of the suggestion .
Learning to maintain a happy , balanced marriage relationship is like learning to ride a bicycle .

Toru and Akiko were in love when they were first married .
But only eight months later , this Japanese couple decided to divorce .
I liked going out , but she liked staying home . ”
Akiko : “ The doorbell rang as I was carrying my bags to the front door .
A woman was standing there .
She was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
But when I saw how he was applying Bible principles , I became more supportive of him .

JESUS has learned that his good friend Lazarus is very sick .
A messenger from Mary and Martha , sisters of Lazarus , has brought Jesus the news .
They know that he has healed people from a distance before . ​ — Matthew 8 : 5 - 13 ; John 11 : 1 - 3 .
The Bible says : “ He actually remained two days in the place where he was . ”
Thomas speaks up courageously : ‘ Let us go that we may die with Jesus . ’
Thomas knows that enemies will again try to kill Jesus , and the apostles may be killed too .
Lazarus ’ body , though , has been in the tomb for days .
“ Lord , if you had been here my brother would not have died , ” she says .
Mary leaves right away to go to Jesus .
So Jesus commands : “ Loose him and let him go . ” ​ — John 11 : 19 - 44 .
Can you understand now why Jesus did not hurry ? — He knew that by waiting he could give a better witness about his Father , Jehovah .
And because he chose the best time , many became believers in God .
Can you see what we can learn from Jesus ’ example ? —
You too may be able to choose a good time to give a witness about the wonderful things God has done and yet will do .
What can you do to show that you have learned from Jesus ’ example ?
What is our spiritual need ?
But to be happy , we have a need that animals do not have ​ — the need for understanding the purpose of life .
How did Jesus give hope ?
He also came with a message of hope .
People who obey God will enjoy everlasting life on earth .
For example , Jesus said : “ When you spread a feast , invite poor people , crippled , lame , blind ; and you will be happy , because they have nothing with which to repay you . ”
Once , after explaining this hope to an interested person , Jesus said : “ My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me . ”

Consider what these people have to say .
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : RUSSIA
I did try to give up drugs .
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE : One thing the Bible taught me was responsibility .
Rather than expecting my mother to support me , I learned that I have an obligation to support myself and my children financially .
Since I have developed a hatred for ungodly things , many of the problems caused by my former lifestyle have disappeared .
HISTORY : LIVED ON THE STREET
I never knew my mother .
When my money ran out , I began working in a pachinko ( gambling ) parlor .
I was depressed and weak - willed and ended up deep in debt to money lenders .
I moved to Hakata , then to Himeji , and eventually to the city of Kyoto .
Mature Christians from the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses studied the Bible with me and helped me to see the importance of applying its principles .
To please them , I went on a couple of job interviews , but at first I did not try very hard .
Prayer also helped me through a very difficult test .
That promise gave me strength and courage .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : What I learned from the Bible prompted me to try to repair my relationship with my father , and he forgave me for my past conduct .
In addition , I am able to work to provide for myself materially .
My family lived in an Aboriginal community named Aurukun , located in the far northern part of Queensland .
The lifestyle was rough .
Eventually , we began studying the Bible together regularly .
I began to see that I needed to make some changes in my personality and lifestyle if I was to please God .
The primary source of knowledge of God is the Bible .
Others , however , live under less favorable circumstances .
Those raised in such an environment might find it difficult to view God as a loving heavenly Father .
The Bible foretold that the good news about God and his purpose for the earth would be preached in “ all the inhabited earth . ”
Even those who have no access to the Bible can still learn much about the true God by observing the things he has made . ​ — Romans 1 : 20 .
“ Lift Up Your Son ”
One day , the grateful prophet tells the woman : “ At this appointed time next year you will be embracing a son . ”
Does the Shunammite have faith that Elisha could do the same for her young son ?
The prophet approaches Jehovah with what must be an intensity of supplication .

Questions From Readers 6
17
Why Be Punctual ?
They also change over the course of time .
“ Men lived and died in quest of honor , reputation , fame , approval , and respect . ”
Rendering honor also meant being outwardly impressed by a person’s wealth , office , or nobility and therefore according him due attention .
Their attempts to get the better of him in public debates before crowds , however , invariably resulted in failure . ​ — Luke 13 : 11 - 17 .
Another concept current in first - century Jewish , Greek , and Roman thinking was the shamefulness of being “ seized and publicly charged with wrongdoing . ”
More shameful than being bound was the indignity of being stripped or flogged .
Social pressure to renounce a person who was dishonored in this way was brought upon his family and friends .
Most people likely considered it absurd for someone to identify himself as a follower of a man who suffered impalement .
A Different Set of Values
“ Let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a busybody in other people’s matters , ” wrote the apostle Peter .
“ If [ a person ] suffers as a Christian , ” wrote Peter , “ let him not feel shame , but let him keep on glorifying God . ”
Jesus ’ enemies slapped him , spat on him , stripped him , flogged him , impaled him , and reviled him .
He refused to shrink from such treatment .
Jesus ’ disciples were also arrested and flogged .
Such treatment dishonored them in the eyes of many .
As Jesus was reclining at a meal in the house of a Pharisee named Simon , a woman ‘ took a position behind Jesus at his feet . ’
The woman “ was known in the city to be a sinner , ” says the Gospel account .
It was to such a person that Jesus said : “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
What did Jesus mean by that ?
That is why Jesus encouraged his followers to pray to God and ask : “ Forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . ”
Luke 11 : 4 identifies these debts as sins .
On what conditions had God forgiven sins in the past ?
His perfect justice requires the penalty of death for sin .
The Jews knew of no other way by which forgiveness could be obtained from God .
On what basis , then , could the transgressions of the sin - laden woman be forgiven ?
This bruising occurred when Jesus was put to death by God’s enemies .
Since nothing can prevent Jehovah from accomplishing what he has purposed to do , as soon as the words recorded at Genesis 3 : 15 were spoken , the ransom was as good as paid from God’s viewpoint .
Hence , Jesus told her : “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
“ God set [ Christ ] forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood .
3 : 25 .
All of us feel the effects of Adam’s sin as explained in these words : “ Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ”
No matter how hard we try to do what is right , we make mistakes , for which we need God’s forgiveness .
Miserable man that I am ! ” ​ — Rom .
Our sinful nature gives rise to these important questions : How was it possible for Jesus of Nazareth to be born free from inherited sin , and why was he baptized ?
How did Jesus ’ life course magnify Jehovah’s righteousness ?
He did so by asking Eve : “ Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden ? ”
True to his infallible word , Jehovah passed the sentence of death on Adam and Eve .
As a full - grown man , Jesus was to be the exact equivalent of the once perfect Adam .
Jesus showed his keen interest in spiritual things by regularly attending meetings for worship .
He also had another precious possession ​ — a perfect human body that could be sacrificed in behalf of mankind .
*
Because John was immersing Jews in symbol of their repentance over sin against the Law .
Jesus ’ presentation of himself also included his willingness to endure persecution and a cruel death in support of Jehovah God’s righteous sovereignty .
He did indeed !
3 : 17 ; Mark 1 : 11 ; Luke 3 : 22 .
Faithful Till Death
What did Jesus do for three and a half years after his baptism ?
Journeying the length and breadth of the Promised Land on foot tired him out , but nothing could stop him from bearing thorough witness to the truth .
Father , save me out of this hour .
Just before he died , why did Jesus say : “ It has been accomplished ” ?
Regarding all who support God’s sovereignty , Satan had made this challenge : “ A person will give up everything he has to save his life . ”
By his faithfulness , Jesus showed that Adam and Eve could have proved faithful under their much easier test .
Many servants of Jehovah lived before Jesus came to the earth .
But on what legal basis could the holy God , Jehovah , bless sinful humans in such a wonderful way ? The Bible explains : “ God set [ Jesus Christ ] forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood .
3 : 25 , 26 .
Jehovah rewarded Jesus with a resurrection to a position superior to the one he had before coming to the earth .
What will be the focus of the next study article ?
Jehovah knew that his Son would be an integrity keeper and that his death would provide a perfect covering for “ the sin of the world . ”
How Would You Answer ?
Do you know what was symbolized by Jesus ’ baptism ?
“ NO CAREFUL student of the Bible can fail to be impressed with the stress that is laid on the death of Christ , ” stated the fourth issue of this magazine back in October 1879 .
Especially appropriate , then , is the apostle Paul’s counsel to Timothy : “ Guard what is laid up in trust with you , turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called ‘ knowledge . ’ For making a show of such knowledge some have deviated from the faith . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
This is evident in that no human has been able to escape eventual death .
6 , 7 .
The apostle Paul said that Jesus “ delivers us from the wrath which is coming . ”
How the Ransom Works
( b ) How did Jehovah prove to be a God of perfect justice ?
Sadly , however , our first parents willfully broke God’s command .
So the sentence of death included us .
In effect , Paul spoke for all of us when he said : “ We know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am fleshly , sold under sin .
Instead , however , he allowed God’s enemies to put him to death so that he could adopt Adam’s sinful descendants and make it possible for those exercising faith in him to receive everlasting life .
How the ransom works can be illustrated by the situation of people who have been defrauded of all their savings by a corrupt bank and thus fell into debt .
That is why John the Baptizer could say of Jesus : “ See , the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world ! ”
What Abraham and Isaac did on that occasion helps us to understand what it must have cost Jehovah to allow Satan’s agents to murder His Son .
11 : 17 - 19 .
The cost of the ransom can also be illustrated by an incident in the life of Jacob .
“ A vicious wild beast must have devoured him !
Jehovah God resurrected his faithful Son with a glorious spirit body .
Jehovah God showed his acceptance of Christ’s ransom by assigning Jesus to pour out holy spirit upon his disciples who were gathered together in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . ​ — Acts 2 : 33 .
Once having received this wonderful hope , could we possibly lose it ?
How should you view the wonderful blessing of being a friend of God ?
The ransom is totally undeserved .
Becoming Jehovah’s friends , however , is not an assurance that we will remain in such a relationship with him .
What does exercising faith in the ransom include ?
When Jehovah’s wrath breaks out upon this wicked system of things , how happy we will be that we have exercised faith in the ransom and have shown an ongoing appreciation for it !
• What was the cost of the ransom ?
• What benefits come from the ransom ?
An Open Invitation !
Visitors often express their heartfelt appreciation for what they observe taking place at Bethel .
In the Hebrew language , “ Bethel ” means “ House of God . ”
Those who have spent many years in this Christian work serve alongside energetic youths .
In Bethel there are neither social distinctions nor feelings of superiority because of one’s assignment .
Meet Some of the Bethelites
Omar comments : “ After our demonstration , our hosts gave us a tour of the facilities .
In 1988 , Alberto , who was deeply involved in politics , visited Bethel in Brazil .
Is there a branch office and Bethel home in your country or in a nearby land ?

( b ) What will be discussed in this article ?
THE weighty message that King Lemuel of ancient times received from his mother included an important qualification of a good wife .
Loving - kindness should be evident in the speech of all true worshippers .
What is loving - kindness ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) What is loving - kindness ?
As the very term suggests , loving - kindness includes the traits of love and kindness .
However , the original - language word for loving - kindness means more than kindness stemming from love .
General kindness , or human kindness , can be expressed even toward strangers .
To have loving - kindness safeguard our tongue , we need to implant that quality in our heart ​ — our inner person .
Let us see how meditation and prayer help us to do just that .
Why should we appreciatively meditate on Jehovah’s acts of loving - kindness ?
Taking time to meditate appreciatively on ‘ Jehovah’s dealings ’ can instill in us the desire to cultivate this godly quality . ​ — Read Psalm 77 : 12 .
( b ) How did David feel about being a recipient of God’s loving - kindness ?
As that time drew closer , the angels who had come to Lot urged him to take his family and quickly leave the city .
19 : 16 , 19 .
The more grateful we are at heart , the more inclined we are to become imitators of the true God . ​ — Eph .
What powerful reason is there for Jehovah’s worshippers to display loving - kindness in their daily life ?
“ [ God ] is kind toward the unthankful and wicked , ” states Luke 6 : 35 .
Before learning the truth and acting on it , we were recipients of God’s kindness , or general kindness .
We can instill loving - kindness in our hearts by coming under the influence of that spirit .
The law of loving - kindness should also govern the tongue of the wife .
She resolves such matters in private .
Where in particular should the law of loving - kindness rule , and how can it do so ?
Even in the privacy of their home , marriage mates must continue to use their tongues in a way that shows that they have respect for each other .
They can do so by providing needed direction and encouragement .
24 : 4 .
Show Loyal Love to Fellow Believers
How may Christian elders and other spiritually mature ones in the congregation imitate Jehovah in this regard ?
Would not loving - kindness move us to use our tongue to try to correct him ?
Rather than questioning the integrity of our brothers , we ought to dismiss such talk silently or ask the accuser , if he is reasonable , whether he is really sure that there is a basis for his remarks .
If enemies of God’s people seek to know the whereabouts of our Christian brothers in order to bring them harm , loyal love for our brothers dictates that we not provide the information . ​ — Prov .
For further discussion of how loving - kindness differs from loyalty , love , and kindness , see the May 15 , 2002 , issue of The Watchtower , pages 12 - 13 , 18 - 19 .
• What will help us to have the law of loving - kindness upon our tongue ?
Yet , being on time is important .
In such an environment , being late can easily become our habit .
If that is so , it is vital that we cultivate a desire to be on time .
The foremost reason we want to be punctual is that we want to imitate the God we worship .
Some 450 years after the Flood , Jehovah told the patriarch Abraham that he would have a son through whom the promised Seed would come .
17 : 21 ; 21 : 2 .
The Bible abounds with examples showing God’s punctuality .
God also determined the times at which certain sacrifices were to be offered .
Does this not indicate that God wants his servants to be punctual in their worship ?
Jehovah’s view of punctuality has not changed .
Facing the Challenge of Punctuality
He arranged for a fellow worker to come to work early to relieve him on meeting nights .
Esperanza explains how her family manages to be punctual : “ My older daughters help get the younger ones ready .
When we arrive at the Kingdom Hall early , we can benefit from hearing about the endurance and faithful service of others in attendance .
Our songs praise Jehovah , remind us of qualities that we should cultivate , and encourage us to participate joyfully in the ministry .
The opening prayer not only requests Jehovah’s guidance and holy spirit but also prepares our minds and hearts to receive the information that will be considered .
When speaking about her reason for arriving early at the meetings , 23 - year - old Helen says : “ I think that it is a way to show my love for Jehovah , since he provides all the information that is presented , including the songs and opening prayer . ”
Yes , we should .
Therefore , let us strive to cultivate the habit of punctuality in all our activities , especially in those having to do with our worship of the true God .
“ O God , give your own judicial decisions to the king . . . For he will deliver the poor one crying for help . ” ​ — PS .
In the case of David , what do we learn about God’s mercy ?
Years before writing them , he experienced remorse after committing adultery with Bath - sheba .
How can Psalm 72 help us ?
As foretold , however , God’s anointed King “ will deliver the poor one crying for help , also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper .
3 : 5 , 9 - 13 .
Yet , far greater wisdom was displayed by Jesus , who could rightly say with reference to himself : “ Look !
Under God’s direction , the Greater Solomon will ‘ plead the cause of the afflicted ones and save the sons of the poor one . ’
Jesus perceived that power had gone out of him and therefore asked who touched him .
When John the Baptist sent two messengers to seek confirmation that Jesus was the Messiah , they found Him ‘ curing many of sicknesses and grievous diseases and wicked spirits and granting many blind persons the favor of seeing . ’
Jesus then told the two : “ Report to John what you saw and heard : the blind are receiving sight , the lame are walking , the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing , the dead are being raised up , the poor are being told the good news . ”
The King Jesus Christ will prove to be refreshing , ‘ like rain upon mown grass and copious showers that wet the earth . ’
The earth - wide extent of the Greater Solomon’s rule is indicated by these words : “ He will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River [ Euphrates ] to the ends of the earth .
Before him the inhabitants of waterless regions will bow down , and his very enemies will lick the dust itself . ”
Yes , Jesus Christ will rule over the entire earth .
14 , 15 .
Sinful humankind is in a pitiable state and is desperately in need of help .
( Read Psalm 72 : 12 - 14 . )
Despite everything he suffered , and although Satan made an all - out effort to turn him away from Jehovah , Jesus proved faithful to Jehovah God .
With loving concern like that of his Father , Jesus will ‘ listen to the poor ones ’ and will ‘ heal the brokenhearted ones , binding up their painful spots . ’
Jesus can “ sympathize with our weaknesses , ” for he “ has been tested in all respects like ourselves . ”
6 : 29 , 30 .
17 , 18 .
Concerning him , it was foretold : “ He will feel sorry for the lowly one and the poor one , and the souls of the poor ones he will save .
How reassuring that is !
A New World of Plenty Awaits Us
No more food shortages , no one undernourished , nobody starving !

Most would also readily agree that there is a difference between inadvertent untruth and outright slander , between causing an accidental injury and committing premeditated murder .
Consider what it says .
Some who appear amiable and kind under normal circumstances seem to undergo a personality change when money is at stake , transforming themselves into obnoxious and hostile characters .
Think of the many crimes that are rooted in greed ​ — blackmail , extortion , fraud , kidnapping , and even murder .
This is true of people speeding on the highway , cheating on exams , embezzling public funds , and worse .
Then the desire , when it has become fertile , gives birth to sin . ” ​ — JAMES 1 : 14 , 15 .
There is no minimizing the influence ​ — for good or for bad — ​ that our associates can have on us .
So often , people do what they have no intention of doing ​ — all because of peer pressure or , as many say , because they fell into bad company , with disastrous results .
These and many other verses in the Bible succinctly explain why people ​ — perhaps otherwise ordinary people — ​ do bad , even shocking , things .
What are these promises ?
The next article provides the answers .
GOD has given us his inspired Word , which points out the reasons why people do bad things .
In the end , our refraining from bad actions will bring happiness both to us and to those around us . ​ — Psalm 1 : 1 .
What might that be ?
“ He will deliver the poor one crying for help , also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper .
“ They will certainly build houses and have occupancy ; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage .
They will not build and someone else have occupancy ; they will not plant and someone else do the eating . For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be ; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full . ” ​ — ISAIAH 65 : 21 , 22 .
Justice will prevail .
“ Certainly , then , shall not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night . . . ?
I tell you , He will cause justice to be done to them speedily . ” ​ — LUKE 18 : 7 , 8 .
People Are Changing ​ — Even Now
Today , Jehovah’s Witnesses , numbering over seven million , are an international brotherhood that transcends racial , ethnic , nationalistic , political , and economic barriers , which have caused so much hatred , violence , and bloodshed throughout history .
Even the lion will eat straw just like the bull .
This prophecy foretells that those who may have had animalistic tendencies would put them aside and develop a Christlike personality because of learning and applying what the Bible teaches .
After receiving training , he was ordered to blow up a police barracks .
While making preparations to do so , he was arrested .
Meanwhile , Pedro’s wife began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Upon his release , Pedro also started to study the Bible , and what he learned about Jehovah God moved him to make great changes in his attitude and his approach to life .
“ Now I use the sword of God’s spirit , the Bible , to give people a message of true peace and justice ​ — the good news of God’s Kingdom . ”
Soon Jehovah will remove the originator of evil deeds , Satan the Devil , who is behind the scenes , as it were , maneuvering the affairs of the world .
The Bible says : “ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
Gone too will be those who stubbornly refuse to leave their wicked ways .
How wonderful to live at such a blessed time !
By gaining accurate knowledge of the Bible and applying it ​ — as did Pedro — ​ you too can look forward to living in a world in which “ righteousness is to dwell . ”
What Do They Believe ?
PARENTS are supposed to set a good example for their children .
Are such children doomed to fail ?
This wicked king carried on Baal worship , with its rites of human sacrifice .
He had one or more of Hezekiah’s own brothers slaughtered .
Ahaz had the doors of the temple closed and “ made altars for himself at every corner in Jerusalem . ”
Upon succeeding Ahaz to the throne , Hezekiah soon showed that he was not the helpless victim of a poor paternal example .
Hezekiah “ continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes . ”
Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah , and “ there proved to be no one like him among all the kings of Judah . ”
In the first year of his reign , the young king began a spiritual reform that led to the removal of the high places , where pagan idols were worshipped .
The past is unalterable ; we cannot erase painful past experiences .
But such experiences do not doom us to failure .

I turned in my 30 - day notice to leave Bethel but did not receive a reply .
Brother Robert Wallen answered the call and came to where I was working .
It had one application for special pioneering and another for circuit work .
Wow !
You can learn a lot from them . ”
What a pleasure to hear the experiences they had had before I was even born !
We were able to encourage young people to start in the full - time service .
Two teenagers in the circuit ​ — Jay Kosinski and JoAnn Kresyman — ​ were just waiting for such encouragement .
Cloris and I were sent to Ecuador in South America , along with Dennis and Edwina Crist , Ana Rodríguez , and Delia Sánchez .
Like us , Ana and Delia were assigned to Cuenca , Ecuador’s third - largest city .
The territory included two provinces .
Cuenca’s first congregation started from our living room .
We wondered how we would ever get the preaching work done .
An evangelical pastor had given him some literature that made serious accusations against Jehovah’s Witnesses .
I reasoned that the accused should be allowed to defend himself .
When the pastor read John 1 : 1 , Mario himself explained the difference between “ the God ” and “ a god ” in Greek .
Joe Sekerak packed literature part - time for the 46 congregations in the whole country .
We were outgrowing our small office .
A brother offered us 80 acres [ 32 ha ] of property outside of Guayaquil .
In 1984 we started to build on this property a new branch office and an Assembly Hall , which were dedicated in 1987 .
One example that stands out in my mind is that of Andy Kidd , a retired schoolteacher from Canada .
Struggling with Spanish , he gave the public talk and then conducted the Watchtower Study .
In that area , there are now two thriving congregations , with almost 200 publishers and many local elders .
As a father , I have reached a goal that seemed impossible in this system ​ — that of being a regular pioneer , sharing in the full - time ministry along with my family .
Now there are well over a million .
When we came to Ecuador in 1966 , there were some 1,400 Kingdom proclaimers here .

Jehovah foretold that in the last days , he would have a clean and peaceable people from all nations , who would preach the good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth despite hatred and opposition .
If the Israelites had been obedient , what would have been the result ?
Jehovah’s blessings would not just come upon God’s people but would “ overtake ” them .
With what attitude were the Israelites to be obedient ?
It is marked by joy that stems from faith that Jehovah’s commandments are not burdensome and that “ he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ” ​ — Heb .
Hebrews 11 : 6 should reassure us of what ?
The original - language word used here implies intensity and concentrated effort .
Its source is the only true God , “ who cannot lie . ”
Jesus Christ proved to be the primary part of Abraham’s “ seed . ”
8 , 9 .
How did the patriarch Jacob exert himself in harmony with his petitions ?
In turn , Isaac told his son Jacob : “ God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you , and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples . And he will give to you the blessing of Abraham , to you and to your seed with you , that you may take possession of the land of your alien residences , which God has given to Abraham . ”
What effort should we make in harmony with God’s revealed will ?
We believe God’s Word when it says that by giving a thorough witness in the short time that remains , we will save both ourselves and those who listen to us . ​ — 1 Tim .
Of what may we be certain ?
Will we always preach in the most productive territory ?
Really , how could we know in advance ?
God’s spirit can qualify people for a work or a service privilege regardless of their previous circumstances or experience .
That powerful spirit equipped modern - day servants of God to care for the needs of the organization when it became necessary to begin their own printing operation .
What if we feel overwhelmed by temptation ?
Besides praying for it , we must diligently feed on God’s inspired Word .
Then to you I will cause my spirit to bubble forth . ”
As you do , be assured that “ everyone seeking finds . ”
Christ’s “ other sheep , ” who are striving to receive a blessing for themselves by means of Abraham’s seed , will delight to hear Him say : “ Come , you who have been blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world . ”
37 : 22 , 29 .
Can You Explain ?
Do you similarly put forth earnest effort ?
“ In unity I shall set them , like a flock in the pen . ” ​ — MIC .
The earth is full of your productions . ”
God’s wisdom is evident in the interdependence of the millions of varieties of plants , insects , animals , and bacteria in earth’s amazingly complex web of life .
The human race exhibits a wide variety of looks , personalities , and skills .

True worship enables people to cooperate as harmoniously as the members of our own body .
Some aspects we will examine in this article are : How does true worship unite people ?
Why is Jehovah the only one who can unify millions of people from all nations ?
What obstacles to unity does Jehovah help us to surmount ?
And as respects unity , how does true Christianity differ from Christendom ?
Thus , they are all spiritual brothers and can enjoy the beautiful unity described by the psalmist : “ Look ! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity ! ” ​ — Ps .
They know that God’s Kingdom will shortly replace human governments and bless obedient mankind with genuine , lasting peace .
True Christians remain neutral in conflicts of the world ; hence , they are able to enjoy unity even when those around them are at war .
The One Source of Spiritual Instruction
These devoted men based their decisions on God’s Word and had traveling overseers communicate their instructions to the congregations in many lands .
Concerning some such overseers , the Bible says : “ As they traveled on through the cities they would deliver to those there for observance the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and older men who were in Jerusalem . ” ​ — Acts 15 : 6 , 19 - 22 ; 16 : 4 .
54 : 13 .
The spirit of companionship that unites those who work together in God’s service is far stronger than the spirit that unites others in the world who merely socialize together .
12 : 2 .
The disciple James tells us frankly : “ All such taking of pride is wicked . ”
For example , a brother with a family might feel jealous of the privileges that a full - time minister enjoys , without realizing that the full - time minister may feel a bit jealous of the family man who has children .
Christendom ​ — Marked by Division
How did apostate Christianity become disunited ?
Then , in successive schisms , many kingdoms split from Rome and formed their own State churches .
Many of those kingdoms warred against one another for centuries .
In the 20th century , some of Christendom’s hundreds of sects initiated the ecumenical movement in a push for unity .
But after many decades of effort , few churches have amalgamated into one , and churchgoers are still divided on such questions as evolution , abortion , homosexuality , and the ordination of women .
Rising Above Nationalism
Although mankind is now more horribly divided than ever , unity continues to distinguish true worshippers .
God’s prophet Micah foretold : “ In unity I shall set them , like a flock in the pen . ”
The unifying of millions of people in true worship is clear evidence of what ?
The global unity of true Christians today is unique and is clear evidence that Jehovah continues to guide his people by means of his spirit .
This is in remarkable fulfillment of what is implied by Revelation 7 : 9 , 14 , and it indicates that God’s angels will soon release the “ winds ” that will destroy the present wicked system of things .
( Read Revelation 7 : 1 - 4 , 9 , 10 , 14 . )
• How can we prevent jealousy from spoiling our unity ?
First - century Christians came from many backgrounds
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
Christian Unity Glorifies God
‘ Earnestly endeavor to observe the oneness of the spirit . ’ ​ — EPH .
How did the first - century Christians in Ephesus bring glory to God ?
In that prosperous trading center , some Christian brothers evidently were wealthy slave owners , while others were slaves and probably very poor .
Clearly , true Christianity drew together people from many backgrounds .
However , the blessed unity of the Ephesian congregation was threatened .
He also likened Christians to the different stones that make up a building .
Paul entreated his Ephesian brothers ‘ to endeavor to observe the oneness of the spirit . ’
While faithful angels have diverse attributes , Christians in addition have various defects .
What attitudes will help us to enjoy cooperating with brothers who have defects different from ours ?
Note how the attitudes recommended in Paul’s next words would help them .
Similarly , Jesus ’ victory over the world provided him with many willing slaves .
( b ) Why should every member of the congregation contribute to its unity ?
For example , if a congregation elder notices two brothers “ stirring up competition with one another , ” he can contribute powerfully to the unity of the congregation by offering private counsel “ to readjust [ them ] in a spirit of mildness . ”
Thus they promote unity and help us advance to Christian maturity .
Divisive indeed !
Similarly , a woman who habitually screams at her husband should be moved to change as she learns how Jesus restrained himself when provoked . ​ — 1 Pet .
Christians should work at being forgiving , not holding a grudge and not talking about the matter again .
Showing respect for the property of others contributes to the unity of the congregation .
We read : “ Let the stealer steal no more . ”
Jehovah kindly forgives imperfect people like us .
We surely would not want to resist the spirit’s leading .
Those from many backgrounds are united
[ Picture on page 18 ]
They subscribe to Jesus ’ statement : “ Your Leader is one , the Christ . ” ​ — Matt .
23 : 10 .
It is reasonable to believe that this angel , who had ‘ Jehovah’s name within him , ’ was God’s firstborn Son .
Prior to his birth as a human , God’s Son apparently had the name Michael .
Jude relates : “ When Michael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses ’ body , he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms , but said : ‘ May Jehovah rebuke you . ’ ”
10 : 5 - 7 , 12 - 14 .
What prophecy was given concerning the coming of the Messiah ?
Christian elders today do well to imitate him in this respect .
Jesus pointed to another aspect of his leadership by comparing himself to a loving shepherd .
Shortly before ascending to heaven , the resurrected Jesus told his disciples : “ All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth . ”
3 : 22 .
Christ Initiates the Preaching Work
During his ministry , he instructed his apostles : “ Do not go off into the road of the nations , and do not enter into a Samaritan city ; but , instead , go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
They did this zealously among Jews and proselytes , especially after Pentecost 33 C.E . ​ — Acts 2 : 4 , 5 , 10 , 11 ; 5 : 42 ; 6 : 7 .
Jesus ’ Leadership Over His Congregation
How does the book of Revelation show that Christ follows closely what goes on in each congregation ?
Jesus followed closely what was going on within the congregations of his anointed followers in the first century C.E .
He had intimate knowledge of the spiritual condition of each congregation .
As a loving spiritual overseer ​ — even to those to whom he gave strong admonition — ​ Jesus stated : “ All those for whom I have affection I reprove and discipline .
We have seen that Michael ( Jesus ) proved to be a valiant angelic Leader of Israel .
During his earthly ministry , he took the lead in the preaching work .
And after his resurrection , he exercised close oversight of the spreading of the Kingdom good news .
By means of holy spirit , Jesus would eventually extend the witnessing work to the ends of the earth .
Before ascending to heaven , Jesus told his disciples : “ You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you , and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth . ”
For a discussion of this prophecy , see chapter 11 of Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy !
• How did God’s Son prove to be an active Leader in Israel ?
[ Picture on page 21 ]
CHRIST was enthroned as King of Jehovah’s Messianic Kingdom in 1914 .
As the archangel Michael in command of his angels , Christ hurled Satan and his demons out of the holy heavens and confined them to the vicinity of the earth .
14 : 15 , 16 .
Jesus likened himself to a man who sowed his field with wheat seed with a view to harvesting a full crop of fine wheat , representing “ the sons of the kingdom , ” true Christians anointed to be associated with him in his Kingdom .
“ The harvest of the earth ” began with the gathering of the remaining ones of the 144,000 “ sons of the kingdom , ” “ the wheat ” of Jesus ’ parable .
That statement indicates that Christ observes not only the collective conduct of each congregation but also the lifestyle of its individual members .
They are appointed after prayer and under the guidance of the holy spirit , so they too can be regarded as under Christ’s direction , or guiding hand .
“ Come , Lord Jesus ”
In the revelation given to the apostle John , several times Jesus said that he was coming quickly .
Eager to see the fulfillment of all the wonderful events that were foretold , the aged apostle John exclaimed : “ Amen ! Come , Lord Jesus . ”
( b ) What will “ the sign of the Son of man ” mean for Jehovah’s people ?
Jehovah will not allow this destructive attack on false religion to wipe out anointed Christians and their other sheep companions .
Jesus added that “ after the tribulation of those days , ” there will be signs in sun , moon , and stars , “ and then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven . ”
They will ‘ raise themselves erect and lift up their heads because their deliverance is getting near . ’ ​ — Matt .
Christ’s conquest will be complete when he destroys Satan’s wicked system .
Then he will abyss Satan and the demons for a thousand years . ​ — Rev .
20 : 1 - 3 .
To what will Christ lead his other sheep during the Thousand Year Reign , and what should be our determination ?
By Way of Review
• In what ways is Christ our Leader yet to come ?
The campaign was scheduled for seven weeks during the summer , culminating in the “ Keep on the Watch ! ” District Convention in Sofia , August 14 - 16 , 2009 .
Circuit overseers in Bulgaria invited local pioneers and publishers to support the campaign too .
During the summer season , the temperature in Bulgaria can reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [ 40 ° C ] .
However , nothing could stop these zealous brothers and sisters .
Silistra , a city on the Danube River with more than 50,000 inhabitants , was given a thorough witness within the first three weeks .
After a lunch break , they often continued until 7 : 00 p.m . or later .
In the first week of the campaign , a Bulgarian - speaking special pioneer sister from Spain preached to Karina , a lady in Silistra who was selling newspapers on the street .
Only three weeks after she had attended her first congregation meeting , she said to the sister conducting the study : “ I feel like one of you .
What do I have to do so that I too can start preaching ? ”
In Kazanlak , a Bulgarian brother named Orlin , who had come from Italy for the campaign , was walking back to his accommodations after field service .
On that visit , Orlin started a Bible study with Svetomir that was continued the very next day .
Svetomir commented : “ Two days before I met you , I prayed to God for help to get to know him .
Carina says about her decision : “ I am so happy that Jehovah allows me to serve here in Bulgaria , and I hope that I will be able to remain here for a long time .
An Italian sister wanted to join the campaign , but having just started a new job , she did not have any vacation days .
When she saw the happiness of the many pioneers who had come so far to preach the good news in her country , she was moved to tears .
What a blessing it is to be active in Jehovah’s service .
Whatever adjustments you can make to expand your share in the ministry , you can be assured that Jehovah will richly bless you . ​ — Prov .
Sandanski
Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Practice Faith Healing ?
▪ Jehovah’s Witnesses have never practiced faith healing .
They also believe that true Christians are identified , not by faith healing , but by something of far greater importance .
Faith healers in Christendom as well as in some non - Christian religions claim to perform miraculous healings .
Yet , Jesus himself sternly warned against individuals who would claim to have “ performed many miracles ” in his name .
On the contrary , he performed a number of healings out of public view .
Granted , some of Jesus ’ first - century followers had special gifts of healing , but these were to cease .
Jehovah’s Witnesses .
First , Jabez implored God , saying : “ Enlarge my territory . ”
His earnest request may have had more to do with people than land .
Those who place their faith and trust in him may have this confidence : “ No matter what it is that we ask according to his will , he hears us . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 14 .
Speaking in Tongues ​ — Is It From God ?
How can that be ? ”
A Sign of God’s Backing
When writing to Christians in the city of Corinth , some of whom apparently could speak in tongues , Paul explained that “ tongues are for a sign . . . to the unbelievers . ”
The gift of tongues bestowed upon Jesus ’ disciples , then , evidently had some additional objective .
However , many of those early disciples were “ unlettered and ordinary . ”
Does the speaking in tongues done in many churches today accomplish these purposes ?
Where would you post a sign to benefit as many individuals as possible in your community ?
God’s Word mentions fornication and other “ works of the flesh ” as being opposed to the operation of holy spirit , adding that “ those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom . ”
Clearly , modern - day speaking in tongues is very different from the gift of holy spirit given to Jesus ’ early followers .
Love is listed as the first of nine aspects of “ the fruitage , ” or product , of God’s holy spirit .
Also , recall Jesus ’ prophecy recorded at Acts 1 : 8 .
October 15 , 2010
STUDY ARTICLES 1 , 2 PAGES 3 - 11
These articles examine how we can endeavor to attain intimacy with Jehovah by learning from Jesus ’ activities .
What reasons do we have for doing so ?
These are some of the questions considered in this article .
STUDY ARTICLE 4 PAGES 20 - 25
It also discusses some adjustments that have been made to this magazine .
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE :
Keeping Myself Busy in Jehovah’s Organization 29
But we do have the mind of Christ . ” ​ — 1 COR .
( b ) What do we need to remember about our thinking and that of Jehovah ?
Additionally , differences in culture and language can result in different patterns of thinking and behavior .
However , the more you get to know others , the more opportunity you have to start to understand their way of thinking .
No .
Are not the ways of you people not adjusted right ? ” ​ — Ezek .
Job reacted in a humble way , adjusting his viewpoint . ​ — Read Job 42 : 1 - 6 .
Gaining “ the Mind of Christ ”
Therefore , examining Jesus ’ activities helps us to understand Jehovah’s way of thinking .
It was just before the Passover of 32 C.E .
Since they were tired from all this activity , Jesus took them to an isolated place on the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee .
However , thousands followed them there .
No .
Jesus here tested the spiritual progress of his disciples .
By asking this question , he got their attention and gave them an opportunity to express their faith in what he could do .
He miraculously fed those thousands of hungry people . ​ — John 6 : 10 - 13 .
Let us now see how these accounts can help us to understand better Jehovah’s own mind .
Jehovah’s Dealings With Moses
How did Moses react to Jehovah’s words ?
The account goes on to say : “ Moses proceeded to soften the face of Jehovah his God and to say : ‘ Why , O Jehovah , should your anger blaze against your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand ?
*
15 , 16 . ( a ) What opportunity opened up to Moses because of what Jehovah said ?
He did not want it to be defamed .
Another example of how Jehovah allows his servants an opportunity to express their faith and trust involves Abraham’s request concerning Sodom .
In that account , Jehovah showed great patience by letting Abraham make a series of eight inquiries .
Of course , Jehovah could have simply stated in the beginning the reasons for his decision .
Yes , Jehovah dealt with Abraham as a friend . ​ — Isa .
2 : 23 .
Lessons for Us
How can we imitate Job ?
Like Job , when we start to understand the mind of Jehovah , we cannot help but exclaim : “ Look !
What should we do if we come across a passage of Scripture that is difficult for us to understand ?
Amen . ” ​ — Rom .
• How can understanding Jesus ’ actions help us to gain “ intimacy with Jehovah ” ?
“ Keep on , then , seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness , and all these other things will be added to you . ” ​ — MATT .
6 : 33 .
As the Creator , Jehovah has the right to set the standard for what is good and what is bad , what is right and what is wrong .
God’s righteousness , however , is not a cold , rigid set of laws or an endless list of rules and regulations .
How important is it to seek Jehovah’s righteousness ?
3 : 23 , 24 .
But , really , if we were to act that way , we would be forgetting Jehovah’s righteousness .
I fast twice a week , I give the tenth of all things I acquire . ’
What does it mean to be “ righteous overmuch , ” and to what can it lead us ?
It is as if we put Jehovah on trial and judged him by our own standards of right and wrong .
But Jehovah is the one who has the right to set the standard for righteousness , not us ! ​ — Rom .
Job had to have his viewpoint corrected .
How do you feel about that ?
Perhaps you immediately identify with the workers who worked all day in the hot sun .
Surely they deserved to be paid more !
Based on that conclusion , the householder could be viewed as being unloving and unfair .
Even his answer to those workers who complained could appear to be an arbitrary abuse of authority .
What other viewpoint could we take with regard to Jesus ’ illustration of the workers in the vineyard ?
He did not underpay anyone .
It is also limited by our inability to discern motives and to know what is really in people’s hearts .
Some Bible readers have felt that way .
Despite their limitations , they were enabled by this law to be consistent in their judgments .
On the other hand , Jehovah can read hearts .
Jehovah could read the hearts of David and Bath - sheba and see their genuine repentance .
Taking such a factor into consideration , he judged them accordingly , in a merciful and loving manner .
Continue to Seek Jehovah’s Righteousness
18 , 19 .
What will help us never to judge Jehovah by our own standards of righteousness ?
So if at times we see something that we feel is unfair on Jehovah’s part ​ — whether we read it in a Bible account or experience it in our personal life — ​ let us never judge God by our own standards of righteousness .
6 : 33 .
So those Jews were , in effect , erecting a figurative monument to their own praise and not God’s .
• Why is it important to seek Jehovah’s righteousness ?
Excuses ​ — How Does Jehovah View Them ?
“ THE woman whom you gave to be with me , she gave me fruit from the tree and so I ate , ” said the man .
Are we to conclude , then , that all excuses are unacceptable to Jehovah ?
Since excuses are often of that nature , they are commonly viewed with suspicion .
Let us , therefore , consider some Bible examples and principles that will help us to “ keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord . ” ​ — Eph .
What God Expects Us to Do
9 : 16 .
Nevertheless , some who have been studying the Bible with us for a long time still shy away from preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom .
He received an assignment that he found extremely difficult ​ — Jehovah told him to declare Nineveh’s impending doom .
What will they do to me ? ’
If you think that the assignment to preach the good news is too difficult for you , remember that “ all things are possible with God . ”
What can you do if you lack the heartfelt desire to carry out your Christian ministry ?
Paul stated : “ God is the one that , for the sake of his good pleasure , is acting within you in order for you both to will and to act . ”
He entreated Jehovah : “ Make me walk in your truth . ”
Some faithful servants of Jehovah in Bible times felt that they were not good enough to handle tasks that Jehovah assigned to them .
What was Jehovah’s reaction ?
Some stop sharing in the ministry or attending congregation meetings because of hurt feelings , reasoning that Jehovah will surely accept this excuse for their spiritual inactivity .
While it is understandable that we are upset when someone hurts our feelings , is it really a valid excuse to stop sharing in Christian activities ?
Similarly , when you have been hurt by a fellow believer , keep in mind that your enemy is not your imperfect Christian brother but Satan , who wants to devour you .
9 : 33 .
However , God’s Word assures us that Jehovah knows our heartfelt desire and takes into account our limitations . ​ — Ps .
13 : 18 .
To illustrate , consider what happened to Ernest , a Christian brother in Canada .
The encouragement presented at congregation meetings to auxiliary pioneer tugged at his heart .
He decided to continue and was blessed with the joy of serving as a regular pioneer for two years , until complications from his injury took his life .
He reminds us that our love should be “ without hypocrisy . ”
Why is it important to take the lead in showing honor to fellow believers ?
The Greek word translated “ honor ” in the Bible conveys the sense of esteem , value , preciousness .
It starts with respect .
Now , if we have valid reasons for showing respect to people in general , how much more ought we to have respect for fellow believers ! ​ — John 3 : 16 ; Gal .
6 : 10 .
Members of One Family
8 , 9 .
What reason for having respect for fellow believers does Paul mention ?
Another reason why we respect one another is mentioned by Paul .
So in a very significant sense , they were a close family .
The same holds true for anointed ones today .
We feel uplifted by a sincere expression of appreciation and respect .
How can each of us contribute to a warm , loving atmosphere in the congregation ?
Now , since Jehovah knows our inborn need for receiving respect , through his Word he properly urges us to “ be eager to show respect for one another . ”
Further , they show honor by taking into consideration the views and expressions of all the elders when making a decision .
Thus , by extension , the admonition to take the lead in showing honor applies to all of us today .
By giving others of our time .
Not surprisingly , therefore , we view time as precious .
Of course , it is understood that there are times when an urgent matter cannot be interrupted .
For instance , when giving them of our time , we should also give them our attention .
We strive to imitate Jehovah by turning our eyes and ears ​ — our full attention — ​ toward our brothers , especially those who approach us for help .
What reminders about showing honor do we want to keep in mind ?
• Why is it important to show honor to one another ?
Congregation meetings truly are a source of encouragement , but that is not surprising .
Therefore , we begin each congregation meeting with a heartfelt prayer to Jehovah in which our heavenly Father is asked to bless our gathering by means of his holy spirit .
Still , we know that all members of the congregation can have a share in making the meeting programs as upbuilding as possible .
We will also consider how the congregation as a whole can share in making meetings uplifting occasions for all who attend .
Starting with the first study edition of The Watchtower , the January 15 , 2008 , issue , a significant detail was included on the front cover .
Did you notice it ?
Because the Bible is our main textbook , an adjustment was made to the Watchtower Study .
More Time Available to Express Our Faith
What opportunity do we have during the Watchtower Study ?
8 , 9 .
How did early Christians view congregation meetings ?
In commenting on these verses , one Bible scholar writes : “ The really notable thing about an early Church service must have been that almost everyone came feeling that he had both the privilege and the obligation of contributing something to it .
10 : 10 .
( a ) What can be learned from the examples of Moses and Jeremiah ?
For those who are timid , though , giving comments can be a real challenge .
Then , before you go to the Kingdom Hall , approach Jehovah in prayer and specifically petition him to give you the courage to give a comment .
( a ) What effect should our meetings have upon those in attendance ?
( a ) What events preceded a meeting that was arranged by Jesus ?
What did Jesus discuss ?
He did not reprimand his apostles ; nor did he use that meeting to question their motives or to deepen their feelings of guilt by referring to their momentary weakness of faith .
11 : 28 ; Acts 15 : 32 .
A sister who together with her husband coped with a severe trial some years ago recalls : “ Being at the Kingdom Hall was like being held in Jehovah’s caring hands .
During the hours we were there , surrounded by our Christian brothers and sisters , we felt that we were able to place our burden on Jehovah , and we experienced a measure of inner calm . ”
It was foretold that some features of first - century Christian meetings would cease .
For suggestions on how to improve our comments at the meetings , see The Watchtower , September 1 , 2003 , pages 19 - 22 .
• How important are Christian meetings ?
Since a good attendance is more encouraging to everyone present , your presence makes a difference .
Participate .
Tell those who have a part at the meeting or who give comments how much their efforts are appreciated .
Help Young Ones to Become Familiar With Jehovah’s Organization
That Jehovah welcomed such questions is evident from what he had commanded Israelite fathers .
Later , Jehovah reminded Israel’s parents about the importance of answering their children’s questions regarding “ the regulations and the judicial decisions ” that Jehovah had commanded . ​ — Deut .
Young ones need to get to know the congregation with which your family associates .
31 : 12 , 13 .
There , they learn to use and respect the Bible and Bible - based literature .
Show them why you look forward to circuit assemblies , district conventions , and the visits of the circuit overseer . ​ — See the box “ Subjects to Consider During Family Worship , ” on page 28 .
Do not think that they do not have time for young people .
If you are able , visit the branch office and Bethel home in your country or perhaps even in other countries .
Rather , he gradually taught them important truths so that they could assimilate them properly .
As the needs of your children change , you can repeat and enlarge upon what they have already learned .
We are confident that you will find much joy in helping your children to become familiar with Jehovah’s organization .
When and how was it formed ?
Father , an anointed Christian , was a fearless evangelizer .
He was always speaking about the truth .
Each town had its bullies , who would come up to us younger ones and mock us .
Although the experience was a bit upsetting , it taught me that when doing street witnessing , one should keep moving and not stand like a post .
I was 13 years of age .
A New Home and a New Partner
However , a young sister named Shirley Turcotte , whom I had met earlier in Winnipeg , became my permanent partner when we got married in February 1961 .
The local radio station warned that the Witnesses were coming and told the people not to accept our publications .
After reading the letter , the lawyer quickly said : “ Look , I don’t want any problems .
Indeed , Jehovah is the one who makes it grow . ​ — 1 Cor .
This inheritance from Jehovah added much joy to our life .
After Lisa finished her schooling , she said : “ Well , Mom and Dad , since I took you out of the full - time service for a while , I will try to make up for it by becoming a pioneer . ”
Jehovah has taught me that if we make ourselves available and accept whatever assignment he gives us , there are many blessings to be reaped .
These dear ones put their heart into the work , and their talents come out .
The result is always a beautiful building to be used in the worship of Jehovah .
Second , loyalty and faithfulness are needed .
When things do not go the way we want them to go ​ — and this will happen — ​ a loyal person will continue to support the theocratic arrangement .
I am also grateful to Jehovah for Shirley , my faithful wife and partner .
See The Watchtower , September 1 , 1990 , pages 10 - 14 , for the life story of Jack Halliday Nathan .
After reading it , the man indicated that he wanted to learn more about the Bible , and he accepted a Bible study .
Raúl has used Good News for People of All Nations to witness to those who speak Armenian , Chinese , English , French , German , Hindi , Korean , Mixe , Persian , Russian , and Zapotec .

18 The Bible Changes Lives
30 Draw Close to God ​ — “ He Will Let Himself Be Found by You ”
31 Our Readers Ask . . .

• Competition at work or at school encourages you to measure your worth against what others are able to do .
• People lack appreciation for what you do for them .
• Friends make you envious of what they have .
• Your fundamental questions about life go unanswered .
We now invite you to consider five secrets of contentment found in God’s Word , the Bible .
Secret 1
Love People , Not Money and Possessions
They want us to slave to gain money so that we can spend it on newer , better , bigger items .
Imitate Jesus , and learn to love people more than things .
He said : “ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ”
Those who pursue money and possessions cause themselves pain and suffering .
“ Practice giving , and people will give to you ”
“ In connection with everything give thanks . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 18 .
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?
He at times felt crushed , his heart numbed by trials .
Jesus replied : “ Let her alone .
Then he added : “ She did what she could . ”
Why not make a mental or a written list of the things for which you are grateful ?
Regularly doing so can help us maintain an appreciative spirit and cultivate contentment . ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
But the negative attitude of the ten spies spread among the people .
“ All the assembly raised their voice , ” the account states , “ and all the sons of Israel began to murmur . ” ​ — Numbers 13 : 30 – 14 : 9 .
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?
You need friends like that , ones who strive to be content and who have your best interests at heart .
“ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . ” ​ — Matthew 5 : 3 .
Some prominent authors assert that belief in God and devotion to him is illogical , even harmful .

“ I wish parents knew how nerve - racking and embarrassing it is to talk to them about sex , ” says a teen in Canada named Michael .
If you are a parent , you need to take a different stance .
The sexual landscape has changed .
How , then , can you talk to your children about this important yet admittedly awkward topic ?
I’m going to tell on you ! ”
Use these years as an opportunity to add to your child’s knowledge gradually .
Don’t force the discussion .
It will likely come naturally if you regularly spend time with your children . ”
This way you will not overwhelm your children .
Now is the time to make sure that your child has sufficient knowledge of the physical , emotional , and moral aspects of sex .
A caution : Teens may hold back from asking questions because they fear that their parents will suspect them of improper conduct .
“ But later we found out that he felt we were suspicious of his behavior .
We made it clear that we were not discussing these subjects because we suspected him of anything ; we only wanted to make sure that he was equipped to handle the bad influences around him . ”
Is that how your schoolmates feel ? ”
Such indirect questions are more likely to get your adolescent to open up and express his or her own views .
Granted , talking to your children about sex may be one of the most awkward parenting tasks you will face .
“ Over time , ” says a mother named Diane , “ the awkwardness fades , and talking to your child about sex can actually become a bonding opportunity . ”
“ It becomes easier to discuss awkward topics like sex if you establish a routine of being open about whatever subjects present themselves in the family , ” he says , adding : “ The awkwardness never completely goes away , but open communication is the lifeblood of a healthy Christian family . ”
Use chapters 1 - 5 , 28 , 29 , and 33 of Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 2 , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses , to have discussions with your adolescent about sex .
“ When I finally got the courage to ask my parents a question about sex , they replied as if accusing me , asking , ‘ Why would you ask about that ?
“ My mother would ask me questions about sex ​ — but in a pleasant tone of voice .
However , brand marks were not always viewed negatively .
An ivy leaf was branded on the devotee of Dionysus . ”
Many modern - day commentators assume that Paul was referring to scars received in different episodes of physical abuse during his Christian missionary activity .
Did the cities of refuge in ancient Israel become sanctuaries for criminals ?
There he had opportunity to prove his innocence .
These cities were not prisons .

Therefore , he is well - qualified to answer the following questions .
But Jesus did show that angels who work closely with God have an active interest in members of the Christian congregation .
“ Where anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it , ” Jesus said , “ the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . ” ​ — Matthew 13 : 19 .
Jesus exposed one way Satan deceives people when he presented an illustration about a man who sowed wheat seed in his field .
“ The enemy that sowed them is the Devil . ”
Concerning his disciples , Jesus prayed to his heavenly Father : “ Watch over them because of the wicked one .
We are now living in “ the conclusion of the system of things , ” and millions are responding to the good news of God’s Kingdom . ​ — Matthew 24 : 3 , 14 .
WHAT moved a former rebel soldier and thief to change his lifestyle ?
Read these accounts to find the answers .
AGE : 47
For five years , I lived in the mountains with the NPA soldiers .
In time , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses visited me in prison and brought me a Bible .
What I read at Proverbs 27 : 11 had an impact on me .
After I was released from prison , I resumed my Bible study with the Witnesses , began associating with them at their meetings , and started applying Bible principles in my life .
“ I Wanted to Represent Brazil . ” ​ — JULIANA APARECIDA SANTANA ESCUDEIRO
When I got home , I sat down and thought about what I was going to do with my life .
They tried to change my mind by saying that I was the best in the country and that I was close to competing in the Olympic Games .
I knew that if I wanted to have the same privilege , I would have to make changes in my life .
But I feel that nothing that this unjust world has to offer can compare with the privilege of serving Jehovah God .
MY PAST : I was born into a religiously divided household in the coal - mining town of Gelsenkirchen .
My father was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He worked ten hours or more a day driving trucks .
I moved away from home when I turned 18 .
Some of those to whom I refused entry or whom I threw out of the club waited outside to try to take revenge .
I was 20 years old and thought I was invincible .
The articles I read about how the present political , economic , and religious system would end moved me to call my sister .
She and her husband were Jehovah’s Witnesses .
However , I drew a lesson from my fitness training ​ — the exercises that are the most difficult are the ones that are the most necessary .
I had another challenge to overcome ​ — I didn’t like reading or studying .
I discovered that just as with weight lifting , you have to put forth effort if you want to gain strength .
But I now enjoy a wonderful family life with my wife , who has a beautiful Christian personality .

Draw Close to God
1 CHRONICLES 28 : 9
About a third of the Hebrew Scriptures have been completed , and Solomon is no doubt aware of what these sacred writings say about God .
Such closeness should deeply affect Solomon’s outlook and way of life .
But he is not to be served with halfhearted hesitancy or doublehearted hypocrisy .
David explains : “ For all hearts Jehovah is searching , and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning . ”
But to develop that closeness , we need to “ search for him , ” digging into the Scriptures in an effort to come to know him intimately .

We may like to compare ourselves with others ​ — sometimes with those who have less than we have , often with those who are stronger , wealthier , or more talented than we are .
Either way , the effect is negative .
We may also stir up feelings of envy and a spirit of competition . ​ — Ecclesiastes 4 : 4 .
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?
Allow his view to influence your sense of self - worth .
“ Mere man sees what appears to the eyes ; but as for Jehovah , * he sees what the heart is . ”
What specifically must you do to have value in God’s eyes ?
If you follow that advice , God will care for you .

The second discusses how they can resist peer pressure .

“ Acquire wisdom , acquire understanding . ” ​ — PROV .
( b ) How can you acquire wisdom and understanding ?
he wrote .
Can you relate to the way Paul felt ?
Do you sometimes find it difficult to do the right thing ?
Does that make you feel frustrated , as it did Paul ?
If so , do not be discouraged .
As a result , he gained the wisdom and understanding needed to cope with challenges and to make good decisions .
Jehovah God can help you to acquire wisdom and understanding .
( Read 2 Timothy 3 : 16 , 17 . )
Consider how you can benefit from the principles found in the Scriptures when dealing with your parents , when handling money , and when you are alone .
3 , 4 .
One reason could be that you desire a measure of independence .
This inclination is normal .
The more obedient you are , the more likely your parents will be to extend greater freedom to you .
Young ones may also face the challenge of dealing with what they view to be unfair criticism from their parents .
An important point to remember is that your parents ’ counsel is likely motivated by their love for you .
So when you are corrected , why not look for nuggets of wisdom in what is being said ?
Rather than dwelling on a seeming injustice , what can young ones do ?
When disciplining you , they may sometimes speak thoughtlessly .
What could cause your parents to act this way ?
They may be under stress , or they may view your mistakes as a failure on their part .
The ability to accept discipline will serve you well when you reach adulthood .
Would you like to cope more effectively with your parents ’ rules and correction ?
What if you want to give an explanation for your speech or actions ?
Once your parents see that you have listened to them , they will be far more inclined to listen to you .
Why should you avoid developing love for money ?
But the same knife in the hands of someone inattentive or careless can cause serious harm .
As a result , they stab themselves “ all over with many pains . ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 9 , 10 .
How can you learn to manage money skillfully ?
She says , “ My father taught me how to make a budget , and he showed me how important it is to be organized in managing family funds . ”
“ She showed me the value of comparing prices before buying , ” says Anna .
She answers : “ I am now able to care for my own finances .
Why should you be on guard against “ the deceptive power of riches ” ?
Making and managing money is an important part of life .
How important it is , then , that you let yourself be guided by God’s Word and maintain a balanced view of money !
Guided by God’s Word When Alone
When will your loyalty to God likely be tested the most ?
It is when you are relaxing and your guard is down that you become most vulnerable to an attack on your moral standards .
Why should you want to obey Jehovah even in private ?
Jehovah is affected by your actions because “ he cares for you . ”
On the other hand , Jehovah felt deep affection for the prophet Daniel , for an angel called him a “ very desirable man . ”
To remain loyal to God when you are by yourself , you must develop your “ perceptive powers . . . to distinguish both right and wrong ” and then train those powers “ through use ” by acting on what you know is right .
For example , when choosing the music you listen to , the movies you watch , or the Internet sites that you visit , here is what will help you choose what is right and avoid what is wrong .
What should you do if you have secretly been engaging in wrong conduct , and why ?
Remember , “ he that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed , but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy . ”
In this regard , “ the older men of the congregation ” can do a great deal for you .
And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well , and Jehovah will raise him up .
32 : 1 - 5 .
Make Jehovah’s Heart Glad
Even if no one else notices the effort you put forth to do what is right , he does .
Nothing is hidden from Jehovah’s eyes .
16 : 9 .
[ Footnote ]
Names have been changed .
Do your peers exert a powerful influence on you ?
Could it be that you want them to accept you ?
No one ​ — young or old — ​ savors the bitter taste of rejection .
Still , Jesus always did the right thing .
As a youth , however , you are on the road to adulthood .
4 , 5 . ( a ) How did Aaron succumb to pressure , and what lessons can you learn from this ?
On one occasion , Moses ’ brother , Aaron , succumbed to peer pressure .
When the Israelites urged him to make a god for them , he did so .
Aaron was not a weakling .
Peer pressure can affect even those who sincerely want to do what is right , including you .
Resisting it successfully starts with developing confidence in what you believe .
If there is no fuel in the tank , you need to find out so that you can do something about it .
Ask yourself , ‘ Why is that a wise command ? ’
You will feel as does one young Christian sister , who states : “ When I take a stand , all I’m doing is letting others know who I am .
Yes , it takes effort to remain firm for what you know is right .
Of what benefit is it to prepare for peer pressure ?
Sometimes a little forethought can help you to prevent a big confrontation .
How likely is it that they will offer you a cigarette ?
Proverbs 22 : 3 states : “ Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself . ”
The key is to follow the admonition of Colossians 4 : 6 : “ Let your utterance be always with graciousness , seasoned with salt , so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one . ”
You probably do not need to launch into a Bible lecture .

How might you tactfully return peer pressure in some situations ?
For instance , if a schoolmate dares you to accept a cigarette from him , you could say , “ No thanks ” and then add , “ I thought you were too smart to smoke ! ”
Rather than your having to explain why you do not smoke , your peer is compelled to think about why he does .
What if despite your efforts , the pressure persists ?
The longer you stay , the greater the chance that you will compromise in some way .
Have ‘ Plans That Make for Advantage ’
How might pressure come from some who claim to be Christians ?
Our parents praised us for what we did .
As the foregoing experience shows , following your Bible - trained conscience may put you in an awkward position .
Be prepared .
If you are going to a gathering , have an exit plan in case things are not as you expected them to be .
21 : 5 .
‘ Rejoice in Your Youth ’
Remember that what many of your peers experience is only “ the temporary enjoyment of sin . ”
The true God wants you to have something far beyond that .
Be prepared ​ — decide in advance what you will say
Young Ones ​ — What Will You Do With Your Life ?
9 : 26 .
You face a similar situation as you grow toward adulthood .
If you have goals , you can run with certainty .
At times , you may feel as though you are facing a maze of options .
Really , everyone owes Jehovah a debt of gratitude .
However , you can rise above such thinking when it comes to your own beliefs .
One goal could be to pray each day .
Once you have reached some of these goals , your confidence will grow , as will your appreciation for Jehovah , and you will be ready to set long - term goals .
If you have not yet started to proclaim the good news publicly , your long - term goal might be to become a Kingdom publisher .
10 , 11 .
What long - term goals can baptized youths set for themselves ?
If you are already a baptized servant of Jehovah , here are some long - term goals you can reach out for .
However , baptism is not a contract that restrains you from doing things that you would secretly like to do ; nor should you get baptized in response to pressure from others .
He also set an example by getting baptized .
After mentioning Noah’s constructing of the ark in which he and his family were preserved during the Flood , the apostle Peter stated : “ That which corresponds to this is also now saving you , namely , baptism , . . . through the resurrection of Jesus Christ . ”
Why might some hold back from baptism , but what assurance do you have ?
If so , such fear is not necessarily unhealthy in itself .
Whatever reasons there are for your hesitation to get baptized , you need to resolve such issues and concerns .
Do I engage in the ministry even when my parents do not ?
Would I continue to serve Jehovah even if my parents and friends stopped doing so ?
Have I prayed about my relationship with God ?
Maintain friendships with those who will support you .
How Can You Reach Your Goals ?
18 , 19 .
If you put things like recreation in first place , you will never seem to have enough room in your life for the big things ​ — spiritual pursuits .
As you strive to reach your goals , including baptism , you may at times experience anxiety and doubts .
When you do , “ throw your burden upon Jehovah himself , and he himself will sustain you . ”
At present , you have the opportunity to share in the most exciting and important work in human history , a worldwide preaching and teaching campaign .
See The Watchtower , August 1 , 2009 , pages 15 - 18 .
How Would You Answer ?
[ Picture on page 16 ]
For instance , the sudden death of a close family member can be emotionally devastating .
In such a situation , one needs encouragement , consideration , and love .
The Bible tells us that “ [ Jehovah’s ] eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ”
Comforting words shared in even a brief conversation can do much to revive the spirit of one bowed low .
In these very practical ways , Jehovah can revive the spirit of a lowly one .
One empathetic traveling overseer made a point of sharing words of consolation with Alex .
He too had lost his wife in death but had since remarried .
With fellow feeling , he lovingly pointed out that Jehovah knows how we feel and what we need .
7 : 8 , 9 , 39 .
The true God wants to help us , and this gives us the motivation and the strength to go on . ​ — Ps .
Adversities often sap a person of physical and emotional strength , even numbing the heart .
143 : 5 .
Such words are a guarantee that he listens to our pleadings .
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 18 ]
Comfort for the Lowly One
“ He [ Jehovah ] is healing the brokenhearted ones , and is binding up their painful spots . ” ​ — Ps .
147 : 3 .

Consider how the military chiefs in Israel showed their gratitude after an armed conflict with the Midianites .
In accord with Jehovah’s direction , the soldiers gave a percentage of their portion to the priests , and the other Israelites gave a similar percentage to the Levites . ​ — Num .
31 : 1 - 5 , 25 - 30 .
To that , the driver responded : “ I gladly accept the card and the book , but I return the money because I wish to contribute it so that you can continue the work you are doing .
Even though I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , I want to make this contribution because I’ve seen that you do things out of love . ”
Each month , congregations forward these amounts to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses that serves their respective countries .
A brief letter stating that such items are an outright gift should accompany these contributions .
However , upon request the funds will be returned .

Stocks and bonds may be donated to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania as an outright gift or Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania may be named as a Transfer on Death beneficiary .
Contact the branch office in your country before deeding any real estate .
The key to answering this question lies in understanding how the words “ perfect ” and “ perfection ” are used in the Bible .
Thus it was through Adam that sin , imperfection , and death were passed on to humankind . ​ — Rom .
This is love such as that shown by God toward humankind .
Today , Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide strive to maintain such a high standard of love for others .
Will we ever be able to enjoy the perfection that Adam lost ?
Jehovah Is Our Sovereign Lord !
Evidently , he was likening the world to a stage , with actors in a drama playing their roles as good or bad characters until a change of scenes .
The illegal organization is a challenge to the sovereign rulership and tests the loyalty of all citizens to their government .
In the Scriptures , Jehovah is often called “ the Sovereign Lord . ”
( Read Revelation 4 : 11 . )
We will be motivated to uphold his lofty position if we always bear in mind that “ Jehovah himself has firmly established his throne in the very heavens ; and over everything his own kingship has held domination . ” ​ — Ps .
To support Jehovah’s sovereignty , we must maintain our integrity to him .

What has happened with the passing of the centuries ?
Jehovah will eventually destroy it and the Devil , giving overwhelming proof of God’s rightful sovereignty .
3 : 15 .
What have many humans done with respect to Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
Jehovah took action against the wicked during the Flood .
Only under those circumstances can we uphold our heavenly Father’s sovereignty and have the hope of being spared when Jehovah clears his name of reproach and demonstrates that he is the Universal Sovereign .
Details regarding mankind and Jehovah’s sovereignty are presented throughout the Bible .
The curtain will fall on the centuries - old drama involving sovereignty .
But to benefit from this and enjoy the many blessings foretold in God’s Word , we must uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty now .
( Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 6 - 10 . )
Yet , they gave way to the temptation of yielding to unrestrained greed when gathering the quail . ​ — Num .
Just before entering the Promised Land , thousands of Israelites were seduced by Moabite women , with whom they committed sexual immorality .
16 : 41 , 49 .
If we put forth needed effort to resist them and rely on God to sustain us , we can maintain our integrity .
By strengthening us to resist temptation , Jehovah makes “ the way out . ”
That spirit also brings back to our mind Scriptural thoughts that we need in order to resist temptation .
For instance , we understand the related issues of Jehovah’s sovereignty and human integrity .
We can be among them if we cling to Jehovah as our Sovereign Lord .
• How do we know that Jehovah will soon assert his sovereignty ?
• In view of 1 Corinthians 10 : 13 , why is it possible to maintain integrity ?
We Shall Walk in Our Integrity !
“ As for me , in my integrity I shall walk . ” ​ — PS .
26 : 11 .
Although Job was sorely tested , he remained faithful to God .
As in Job’s case , God uses his perfect standard of justice to measure our integrity as his dedicated servants .
But what if we were devious in word or action , thus causing a fellow believer to petition God for help ?
Then , too bad for us !
Integrity and greed do not mix !
What example did Job set in avoiding idolatry ?
Integrity keepers do not deviate from pure worship .
To maintain our integrity to God , we must avoid all idolatry . ​ — Read 1 John 5 : 21 .
Job was hospitable .
Why should we not try to hide grave sin ?
It must have been spiritually upbuilding to enjoy Job’s hospitality , for he was not a hypocrite .
He was not like the ungodly men who slipped into the first - century congregation and were “ admiring personalities for the sake of their own benefit . ”
So he submitted his case and awaited the judgment of the divine court .
We can sing to Jehovah and benefit from regular association with his people .
Then , too , our love for God will grow as we engage in the ministry and declare “ the good news of salvation by him . ”
• How should we view Jehovah’s moral standards ?
• Why is it possible for us to maintain our integrity to God ?

The 1983 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses reported that Brother Jaracz “ greatly encouraged the brothers throughout the country by his zeal for theocratic orderliness and a fine lead in the field . ”
They began their married life in the traveling work , diligently serving circuits and districts covering a large part of the United States .
Draw Close to God
He Knows “ the Heart of the Sons of Mankind ”
Yet , there is someone who fully understands our feelings ​ — Jehovah God .
* Perhaps Solomon recalls that his father , David , when greatly distressed , said : “ Throw your burden upon Jehovah . ” ​ — Psalm 55 : 4 , 22 .
Solomon beseeches Jehovah : “ May you yourself hear from the heavens , the place of your dwelling , and you must forgive and give to each one according to all his ways . ”
Jehovah provides the help needed , including forgiveness for the sinner who returns to God with all his heart . ​ — 2 Chronicles 6 : 36 - 39 .
Continuing his prayer , Solomon observes : “ Because you [ Jehovah ] know his heart ( for you yourself alone well know the heart of all the sons of mankind ) . ”
“ Throw all your anxiety upon him , ” says the Bible , “ because he cares for you . ” ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
AFTER the Haiti earthquake on January 12 , 2010 , I found it hard even to look at the devastation on the news .
Since then , we have volunteered for other projects and have become close friends .
Four days later , on Monday the 25th , I received a call from Brooklyn asking if I could travel to Haiti ​ — the following day if possible !
I could not believe my ears .
On January 28 , after managing to get a plane ticket , I flew from New York to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic , which borders Haiti .
The next morning , we were driven to the Haiti branch office in Port - au - Prince , a journey of seven and a half hours .
Many homes , including the presidential palace , were damaged , while others had been reduced to piles of rubble .
She thanked us for putting our lives on hold to be there .
She told me that she was at the home of a friend when the earthquake struck .
The friend’s body was lying partially on Ketly until rescuers arrived four hours later .
One day you have everything going for you , and before you know it , you find yourself like this . ”

When those words were translated into Greek , the word “ garden ” was rendered pa·raʹdei·sos , from which came the English word “ paradise . ”

The earth was to become the permanent home for all mankind .
No .

So the secret is called the sacred secret because it is from God , who is holy .
“ The princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder , ” the Bible says .
For a long time , it was not known how many people would rule in heaven with Jesus as part of his Kingdom .

Questions From Readers 30
PARENTS : In the January 15 , 2010 , issue , pages 16 - 20 , we mentioned having practice sessions with your children .
This article provides ideas to help you to prepare your young child to meet challenges at school .
CHILDREN who are Jehovah’s Witnesses encounter many challenges .
It’s against my religion . ”
These accounts may help to explain why Witness children do or do not do certain things .
As children try to defend their faith , parents will want to commend their efforts and show them how they can improve their reasoning and why that is desirable .
For example , suggest using words that students of a similar age can understand .
Some schoolchildren who ask a question may lose interest if a lengthy answer is given .
By engaging them in conversation and reasoning with them , Witness youths may keep the interest alive .
Haneul , a ten - year - old girl , says , “ My schoolmates like a conversation , not an explanation . ”
The conversations set out below show how Christian children might reason with their schoolmates .
Therefore , a young Witness should get the idea in mind , put it in his or her own words , and then express it in a manner appropriate to the situation and the schoolmates .
As they try to explain the basis for their beliefs , help them to develop reasonableness and tact .
Mary : Hi , John .
I would like to invite you to my birthday party .
But why not think about this ?
While a lot of people like receiving birthday gifts , the Bible says that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving .
Gail : Claire , why don’t you salute the flag ?
Claire : I know you love your mom , Gail .
But I don’t feel quite that way .
I can’t give my life to my country because God gave me life .
And if you want to know why I do or don’t do certain things , just ask me .
Claire : I’ll tell you about them during lunch .

Be Zealous for True Worship
That is urgency !
For true Christians today , nothing is more urgent than preaching the good news of the Kingdom and making disciples of people of all the nations .
That , of course , is the way it should be .
Because the preaching work is of such importance to us , it deserves our giving it as much of our time , energy , and attention as possible .
Yet , they are richly blessed by Jehovah .
That being so , some might find it difficult to maintain a sense of urgency year after year , especially if they have been doing so for a long time .
Rather , he focused on using every opportunity to do his Father’s will and to show love to his fellow humans .
To expose and disrupt their scheme , Jesus was pitting himself against the religious establishment of the day .
What , though , is zeal ?
Is it different from urgency ?
Urgency and Zeal Compared
One dictionary defines “ zeal ” as “ eagerness and ardent interest in pursuit of something , ” and it offers as synonyms such words as passion , fervor , ardor , and enthusiasm .
Surely Jesus ’ ministry can be characterized by all these expressions .
( Read Exodus 20 : 5 ; 34 : 14 ; Joshua 24 : 19 . )
David’s zeal was jealousy in the positive sense , that is , an intolerance of rivalry or reproach , a strong urge to protect a good name or to correct an injury .
Be Zealous for True Worship
( b ) God’s Kingdom ?
The religious scene around us today is similar ​ — if not worse — ​ than it was in Jesus ’ day .
For example , recall that the first thing Jesus taught his followers to pray for concerned God’s name : “ Let your name be sanctified . ”
Do we see the religious leaders , especially the clergy of Christendom , teaching people to know God by his name and to sanctify , or honor , that name ?
They have also brought reproach on God by their scandals and their hypocrisy .
4 : 7 , 8 .
Jesus also taught his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom : “ Let your kingdom come .
Though Christendom’s religious leaders often repeat that prayer , they have urged people to support political and other human institutions .
In prayer to God , Jesus clearly stated : “ Your word is truth . ”
They have been inclined to label what the Bible says as fable or myth .
How do you feel about all that the clergy have done in the name of God ?
They have fallen prey to Satan and his wicked system of things .
As a servant of Jehovah , when you see the reproach and blasphemy heaped upon God’s name , do you not feel impelled to do what you can to right the wrong ?
When Jesus saw people of his day being “ skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd , ” he did not just feel pity .
We have every reason to be zealous for true worship , as Jesus was .
How can we develop such zeal ?
We will consider this in the following article .
Nevertheless , we also need to discern what is the most important work that we must do at any given time .
Having clearly in mind what his priorities were , he knew that the long - awaited time for many Messianic prophecies to be fulfilled was at hand .
And he had to lay the foundation for the Christian congregation , which would carry out the preaching and disciple - making work to the ends of the earth . ​ — Mark 1 : 15 .
That awareness was a positive force in Jesus ’ life , motivating him to be zealous in carrying out his Father’s will .
10 : 5 - 7 ; 11 : 1 ; Luke 10 : 1 .
1 : 16 .
Reading the book of Acts , we cannot fail to note the courage and zeal that Paul exhibited in carrying out his ministry .
Paul recognized the significance of the time in which he lived .
But to what was Paul here referring ?
He explained that they were called by God for a specific purpose , to carry out “ the ministry of the reconciliation , ” to beg people to “ become reconciled to God . ”
5 : 19 ; Isa .
His hand is still extended in our day .
Paul’s words “ now is the especially acceptable time ” and “ now is the day of salvation ” still apply .
What has “ the day of salvation ” meant for anointed Christians , past and present ?
The first ones to benefit from this expression of undeserved kindness were those “ in union with Christ . ”
For example , as noted in the book Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom , at the turn of the 20th century , “ C .
The clergy of Christendom had long been doing just that .
Among other things , they made wise use of the latest technology to advance their work .
They also prepared syndicated sermons and articles for thousands of newspapers .
We should take to heart what purpose of God ?
The majority of mankind , blinded by Satan , are still alienated from God and ignorant of the purpose of God’s undeserved kindness .
How , then , can we develop and maintain our zeal for true worship ?
How we can benefit if we learn from his example !
The word translated “ aglow ” literally means “ boiling . ”
That means taking seriously our family and congregation worship ​ — being regular in personal and family study , in prayer , and in meeting with our fellow Christians .
That will help us to have the “ fire ” to sustain the “ boiling ” that will keep us “ aglow with the spirit . ” ​ — Read Acts 4 : 20 ; 18 : 25 .
As dedicated Christians , our objective is to do whatever Jehovah wants us to do , even as Jesus did .
• What was “ the ministry of the reconciliation ” entrusted to Paul and other anointed Christians ?
• How have the anointed remnant made good use of “ the especially acceptable time ” ?
Paul never forgot his encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ
Reap Blessings Through God’s Spirit - Guided King !
“ IN A world that is in chaos politically , socially and environmentally , how can the human race sustain another 100 years ? ”
We have fought too many ‘ wars to end war ’ to believe that we know how to end war . ”
As such , he has the prerogative to set standards for us , to define what purpose our life should have , and to guide us toward that purpose .
Moreover , he will soon act on his authority to end mankind’s failed attempts at self - government .

Next to Jehovah , Jesus has the most comprehensive knowledge of all creation , including humankind .
Just think about that !
Jesus , as God’s “ master worker , ” shared in all other aspects of creation .
How is your confidence in Jesus as Ruler enhanced by reflecting on his earthly experiences ?
His own experience as a human and his close association with imperfect people did much to help qualify Jesus as King .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ [ Jesus ] was obliged to become like his ‘ brothers ’ in all respects , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , in order to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people .
20 : 28 .
Why can we have complete confidence in Jesus as our Ransomer ?
( Read Isaiah 11 : 4 ; Matthew 16 : 27 . )
Do you cherish the privilege you have of serving as God’s fellow worker along with his spirit - guided Son ?
Through Christ , Bless Yourself !
Jehovah told Abraham : “ By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves due to the fact that you have listened to my voice . ”
17 , 18 .
To Abraham’s fleshly seed , the nation of Israel , God once said : “ All these blessings [ set out in the Law covenant ] must come upon you and overtake you , because you keep listening to the voice of Jehovah your God . ”
What , though , does “ listening ” involve ?
Jesus said : “ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will . ”
Why is it urgent for us to obey God’s Son ?

( a ) What effect can music have on an individual ?
Music’s Honorable Place in True Worship
15 : 16 .
Was it just because the king was a musician ?
At 2 Chronicles 29 : 25 , we read : “ He [ that is , Hezekiah ] had the Levites stationed at the house of Jehovah , with cymbals , with stringed instruments and with harps , by the commandment of David and of Gad the king’s visionary and of Nathan the prophet , for it was by the hand of Jehovah that the commandment was by means of his prophets . ”
According to 1 Chronicles 25 : 8 , there were ‘ learners ’ as well .
The Role of Music After David’s Day
At the inauguration of the temple , there was a full - scale orchestra , with a brass section composed of 120 trumpets .
( Read 2 Chronicles 5 : 12 . )
The Bible tells us that “ the trumpeters [ who were all priests ] and the singers were as one in causing one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah , . . . ‘ for he is good , for to time indefinite is his loving - kindness . ’ ”
After Paul and Silas were thrown into prison , they began “ praying and praising God with song , ” although they had no songbook to follow .
If you were thrown into prison , how many of our Kingdom songs would you be able to sing from memory ?
Singing is part of our worship .
13 , 14 .
What value is there in singing out wholeheartedly during congregation meetings ?
At that time in his life , he had despaired of ever finding the truth about God .
Notice that it was the singing that initially attracted Brother Russell to the meeting .
What refinements in understanding made a revision of the songbook advisable ?
How will our new songbook help us to follow Paul’s counsel found at Ephesians 5 : 19 ?
You Can Show Your Appreciation
Look at it this way : Where the spoken word is concerned , is it not true that “ we all stumble many times ” ?
Why , then , should our imperfect singing voices prevent us from praising God in song ?
4 : 11 .
They feature beautiful orchestral and choral renderings of the new songs .
The lyrics of many of the songs have been composed in such a way that when you sing one line , you will almost be able to anticipate what comes next .
What steps are involved in preparing orchestral renditions of our Kingdom songs ?
A lot of work is involved in its preparation .
What are you determined to do ?
104 : 33 .
They were among the 2,352 people who took that step in Spain during 2009 .
Eventually , ten members of this family took the step of baptism .
“ Jehovah has been very good to me , allowing me to get to know him , ” said the 107 - year - old Ana .
What brings special joy to these two widows is attending the meetings .
Their faithful example brings to mind a widow named Anna “ who was never missing from the temple , rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications . ”
My parents and older brother , Angelo , were born there .
Father was a calm , pensive man , yet injustice angered him .
On retiring , he took up the full - time ministry and persevered in it until ill health and the severe winters forced him to stop at age 74 .
Even then , he continued preaching between 40 and 60 hours a month into his 90 ’ s .
Father’s example had a profound effect on me .
So in August 1946 , we were married .
We then were sent to Naples , Italy , with another missionary couple , Carl and Joanne Ridgeway .
It was difficult to find a house , so for a few months , we lived in a tiny two - room apartment .
They sold contraband cigarettes .
In the morning , with cigarettes stuffed in the many pockets of her skirt , she looked fat .
The truth totally transformed this family .
Fern and I were assigned to Turin .
Initially , a lady rented us a room , and we had use of her bathroom and kitchen .
Capable local brothers could now handle matters .
Florence ​ — A Wonderful City
Our next assignment was Florence .
We had often heard of this city , as it was the missionary assignment of my sister Carmela and her husband , Merlin Hartzler .
The older children begged him to stop .
They had already said their own prayers .
During that period , the zone overseer suggested that I serve as his assistant .
So we began visiting surrounding lands .
It was not easy having no one to encourage us .
In Somalia , there were various difficulties .
Sometimes they landed on our necks while we conducted home Bible studies .
We bought a little car , which we used for five years to travel around two circuits .
We encouraged young ones to grow spiritually and reach out to serve as congregation overseers , traveling ministers , or Bethelites .
We have appreciated their qualities , such as absolute loyalty to Jehovah , generosity , love for their brothers , and a spirit of adaptability and self - sacrifice .
Rather , most congregations enjoy beautiful Kingdom Halls that honor Jehovah .
That encounter also sent her to the hospital .
Though we at times battled discouragement , we have ‘ waited for Jehovah , ’ in line with Lamentations 3 : 24 .
He wrote that since he was born near Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , where Fern started pioneering , he well knew that Pennsylvania Dutch women like her are strong and tenacious .
A book would not suffice to recount the wonderful ways in which we have seen the power of God’s Word transform the lives of those who have tasted Jehovah’s mercy . ​ — Mic .
The joy of the Lord is our strength .

“ We mustn’t let our spirit lose its sparkle ”
Prior to the Flood , many humans lived for centuries .
No .
And there are other instances when Jehovah informed Noah of certain facts . ​ — Gen .
Significantly , in the historical record about developments long before Adam’s time , we find such expressions as : “ God went on to say . ”
It is logical , therefore , to conclude that Genesis 6 : 3 expresses God’s resolve to end the corrupt system of things on earth .
Jehovah issued a judicial decree to do so in 120 years , though Noah was not yet aware of that .
Yes , God’s patience for 120 years allowed for those things to be accomplished and set the stage for the preservation of life , allowing eight faithful humans to be “ carried safely through the water . ”
And you know that it did . ​ — 2 Pet .

Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you .
Why learn from God ?
He tells us about it in the pages of the Bible .
Mankind needs good government .
God will give mankind a good government that will bring freedom from all causes of suffering . ​ — Read Daniel 2 : 44 .
Why is it vital to learn from God ?
Who is the Author of the Bible ?
The first five were written by Moses about 3,500 years ago .
To help them , Jesus referred to one Bible text after another and explained “ the meaning of the Scriptures . ”
Draw Close to God
But this repentant sinner found hope in the Bible account about Manasseh , recorded at 2 Chronicles 33 : 1 - 17 .
If you have ever felt unworthy because of past sins , you too may find comfort in Manasseh’s example .
What it does tell us is that Manasseh descended to gross idolatry and cruelty .
He set up altars to false gods , offered his own sons in sacrifice , practiced spiritism , and put a graven image in Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem .
Stubborn Manasseh refused to heed repeated warnings from Jehovah , the God whose miracle had enabled his birth . ​ — Verses 3 - 10 .
There , in exile , Manasseh had a chance to reflect on his course .
Jehovah was touched by Manasseh’s sincere repentance .
Young’s Literal Translation here reads : “ He . . . appeased the face of Jehovah his God . ”

It is a figurative “ day of storm . ”
However , we can find the refuge we need .
Isaiah , who lived in the eighth century B.C.E . , likened Jehovah’s judgment on the apostate ten - tribe kingdom of Israel to a “ thunderous storm ” that people would not be able to prevent .
( Read Isaiah 28 : 1 , 2 . )
How did a “ great day of Jehovah ” strike Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E . ?
That event occurred because the people of Judah had also turned apostate .
28 : 14 , 17 .
The great day of Jehovah that struck Jerusalem was an indication of the judgment to come upon apostate Christendom in our time .
Yet , God’s people as a group will survive because they are taking refuge in Jehovah . ​ — Rev .
We find spiritual refuge by prayerfully “ thinking upon [ God’s ] name ” and by serving him zealously .
We can appreciate , though , that we need to do more than just think upon his name .
They were able to flee the city and the surrounding area .
In the past , first - century Christians sought refuge , and God’s servants today will do likewise .
One indication of this is the Letter to the Bishops ’ Conferences on ‘ the Name of God , ’ dated June 29 , 2008 , issued by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments .
The Vatican instructed that God’s personal name should not be used or pronounced in hymns and prayers during Catholic religious services .
They sanctify it by using it in a dignified way .
Who upheld Jehovah’s name in ancient Judah , and who have done so in modern times ?
This has proved true in our time too .
And he rejoices over them down to this day .
14 , 15 . ( a ) What have some used as talismans ?
Still , an object that features God’s name should not be considered a talisman or used as a charm in everyday life as if it had some magical power of protection .
This is not what it means to take refuge in the name of Jehovah .
Striving to keep morally clean also helps us to maintain our spiritual security .
17 , 18 .
We read : “ Then I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language , in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah , in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder . ” ​ — Zeph .
You are in a sense using that language when you share with others the correct understanding of God’s Kingdom and how it will sanctify his name , when you stress the vindication of God’s sovereignty , and when you happily talk about the everlasting blessings faithful humans will enjoy .
Desperate to solve their problems , many look to imperfect men .
Soon the figurative hailstorm of Jehovah’s day will strike the earth .
Human schemes will not be able to provide protection ; neither will nuclear shelters nor wealth .
18 : 10 .
• What refuge is assured us for the future ?
See the Name in the Valley
ST .
It may , because it is a world famous holiday resort in Switzerland’s Engadine Valley .
It is also home to the Swiss National Park , where the area’s natural beauty and rich variety of flora and fauna praise our Grand Creator , Jehovah .
But so do the remnants of a tradition that dates back to the mid - 17th century .
It is not rare to find God’s name inscribed on the house front , such as over the main door .
You can see an even older inscription in the village of Madulain .
Unless Jehovah builds the house , it is in vain that its builders have worked hard on it .
Visitors and residents alike in this valley are welcome to learn more about the wonderful God , Jehovah , by visiting another building that bears his name ​ — the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Bever .

As told by Maatje de Jonge - van den Heuvel
For 70 of those years , I have had the pleasure of serving Jehovah ​ — but not without having my faith tested .
When I delivered some food to them , I learned that the young man was a pioneer .
Although I had little Bible knowledge , I fully understood that by becoming a Witness , I became part of an organization that was banned .
Still , I immediately set out preaching from house to house , and my husband and I opened our house as a place of lodging for pioneers and traveling overseers .
They entered the house and searched it .
However , 18 difficult months would pass before I could hold her in my arms again .
The first night , we were kept in a transit barracks .
There , for the first time since my arrest , I broke down in tears .
“ What is going to happen ?
Frankly , at that point my relationship with Jehovah was not yet very strong , since I had known the truth for just a few months .
Their company strengthened me ​ — indeed , it cheered me up .
In contrast with the cruel conditions we faced in the camp , our barracks was like a clean island surrounded by a filthy sea .
We received very little food , but all of us sisters tried to save a piece of bread every day so that we would have something extra on Sundays , when we had an opportunity to get together to discuss Bible topics .
At times , we were ordered to do work that directly supported the war effort of the Nazis .
When the sisters learned what I had done , some began to avoid me .
To demonstrate further to Jehovah my heartfelt desire to be a loyal servant , my husband and I again opened our home as a lodging place for the couriers and the traveling overseers .
Truly , the trials I went through in Ravensbrück were nothing compared to the pain I felt when we lost our child .
One couple in the traveling work , Maarten and Nel Kaptein , even lived in our home for 13 years !
The association with them and with the dear local brothers and sisters has helped me to enjoy the spiritual paradise in which we live right now .
One of the highlights of my life came in 1995 ​ — an invitation to attend a commemoration in Ravensbrück .
The apostle Paul states at Romans 15 : 4 that “ through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope . ”
I thank Jehovah for furnishing this hope , which has enabled me to serve him gratefully , even under trials .

“ That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh . ” ​ — GEN .
JEHOVAH GOD , the Originator of marriage , surely deserves our respect .
This is a manifestation of his great love .
Everything he has taught us , everything he has asked of us , everything he has given to us has been only for our welfare and benefit . ​ — Isa .
When he performed the first wedding , Jehovah gave the couple , Adam and Eve , specific instructions on how to succeed .
However , they foolishly disregarded God’s command and suffered terrible consequences . ​ — Gen .
3 : 6 - 13 , 16 - 19 , 23 .
( b ) What examples will we consider in this article ?
And how can those who are contemplating marriage prepare for it ?
An Israelite man back then might treacherously divorce his wife if she bore him no children .
Zechariah , though , loyally stayed with Elizabeth .
Although having no children saddened them , they continued to serve Jehovah together faithfully .
When her son , John , was born , Zechariah could not speak because he had been struck with speechlessness for questioning God’s angel .
The neighbors and relatives wanted to name the boy after his father .
But Elizabeth loyally upheld her husband’s direction to her .
8 , 9 . ( a ) How does loyalty strengthen a marriage ?
Flirtation , pornography , adultery , and other threats to a wholesome marriage can irreparably destroy marital trust .
And when trust within a marriage breaks down , love begins to wither .
Thus , when a husband and wife are loyal to each other , they can reside together safely and open their heart to each other , letting their love grow .
Jehovah told Adam : “ A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife . ”
What does that mean ?
Friends and relatives can no longer take priority at the expense of the new family ; nor should the couple allow parents to interfere in family decisions or disagreements .
That is God’s direction .
For example , when Paul first arrived in Corinth , Aquila and Priscilla kindly invited him to stay in their home , which he apparently used for a time thereafter as a base for his activities .
Later , in Ephesus , they used their home for holding congregation meetings and worked together to help new ones , such as Apollos , to grow spiritually .
16 : 3 - 5 .
For a time , Aquila and Priscilla also worked with Paul in their common trade , tentmaking .
Unfortunately , many couples today spend little time together .
They work long hours at their separate jobs .
Even at home , some marriage partners find themselves isolated from each other because of the time they spend on television , hobbies , sports , video games , or the Internet .
If so , can you adjust your circumstances to spend more time together ?
Also share together in the ministry .
A sister who pioneered with her husband says : “ The ministry was one of the ways we could spend time together and really talk .
Deep respect for Jehovah , therefore , is still the key to a happy , successful marriage .
How did Joseph and Mary manifest spirituality in their family life ?
“ As we have served God together , ” they say , “ our marriage has become stronger . ”
127 : 1 .
Continue to Respect God’s Gift
But a servant of Jehovah sees things differently .
As we have seen , loyalty , unity , and spirituality are godly qualities that fortify a marriage .
In our next article , we will look at yet another precious gift from God ​ — the gift of singleness .
[ Pictures on page 15 ]
“ Let him that can make room for it make room for it . ” ​ — MATT .
MARRIAGE is unquestionably one of God’s most precious gifts to mankind .
What advantages do single Christians often enjoy ?
A single person often has more time and greater personal freedom than a married person does .
Others may not have initially planned for singleness , but when their circumstances changed , they prayerfully reflected on their situation and realized that with Jehovah’s help they too could be settled in their heart .
7 : 37 , 38 .
Why can single Christians feel complete in God’s service ?
What is needed in order to obtain the full rewards of singleness ?
Still , as with such gifts as musical or athletic talent , the gift of singleness has to be cultivated in order to realize its full potential .
The evangelizer Philip had four virgin daughters who shared their father’s zeal for evangelizing .
Prophesying was among the miraculous gifts of the holy spirit , and these young women used that gift in fulfillment of Joel 2 : 28 , 29 .
What enabled John Mark to pursue spiritual goals , and what blessings did he receive for doing so ?
In his youth , John Mark also used his single years to good advantage .
Despite these advantages , however , even as a young man , Mark was not self - indulgent or self - centered ; nor was he content to settle down and lead a comfortable family life .
How long Mark remained single , we do not know .
As Mark’s comments reveal , the greatest joy in life comes from giving , and a full life in sacred service offers many opportunities for giving to others .
But the Bible reports that at age 84 , Anna was still a widow .
From what the Bible says , we can conclude that Anna used her changed circumstances to draw closer to Jehovah .
( b ) How was Dorcas rewarded for her goodness and kindness ?
Since the Bible mentions no husband , she was likely unmarried at the time .
What moves single Christians to draw closer to Jehovah ?
“ I wonder , ‘ Who will encourage me ? ’ ”
How may unmarried Christians “ widen out ” in their love ?
Singleness is a real opportunity to give to Jehovah , your family , and your brothers and sisters , as well as to your neighbors .
The older I get , the happier I feel about my single state . ”
Can you too “ widen out ” in your love for others ?
Singleness was an advantage in his case . The apostle Paul traveled thousands of miles and faced great hardships in the ministry .
For the sake of the ministry , both Jesus and Paul encouraged others to imitate their example where possible .
All unmarried Christians who are doing their best to serve Jehovah deserve our genuine commendation and encouragement .
Do You Recall ?
What help did Jesus promise his disciples , and why would they need it ?
Considering the scope of their preaching commission , the strength of their opponents , and the frailty of the human flesh , it was clear that they needed superhuman power .
Thus , just before his ascension to heaven , Jesus assured his disciples : “ You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you , and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 8 .
“ All the days until the conclusion of the system of things , ” Jesus ’ faithful followers , including us , would be in urgent need of that same God - given strength . ​ — Matt .
Jesus promised his disciples that ‘ they would receive power when the holy spirit arrived upon them . ’
The terms “ power ” and “ spirit ” are distinct in their meaning .
Power , however , can be defined as the “ ability to act or produce an effect . ”
How is the power given to us by holy spirit manifested ?
As we seek to serve God faithfully , we face numerous obstacles caused either by Satan , by his system of things , or by our own imperfect flesh .
Jesus taught his followers to pray : “ Do not bring us into temptation , but deliver us from the wicked one . ”
26 : 42 .
Upon what did Jesus base his answers to Satan’s temptations ?
In answer to the Devil’s temptations , Jesus quoted scriptures .
Through what means can we obtain holy spirit ?
9 , 10 . ( a ) What temptations are common in your area ?
Have you ever been tempted to flirt with someone who is not your marriage mate ?
They feel tired , burdened down , worn - out , and even burned - out .
( Read John 14 : 16 , 17 . )
Since then , she has undergone surgery twice , received radiation treatment , and suffered two more strokes , which left her with limited movement on her left side and limited vision .
Stephanie has to save her energy for the things that she considers more important , such as Christian meetings and field service .
Brothers and sisters have supported her by sending her letters or by speaking encouragingly to her before and after meetings .
For all of this , Stephanie feels a great debt of gratitude to Jehovah .
Her favorite scripture is Psalm 41 : 3 , which she believes has been fulfilled in her case .
( a ) Does Jehovah promise that he will make life effortless for a Christian ?
“ They will mount up with wings like eagles . They will run and not grow weary ; they will walk and not tire out . ”
Reasonableness and modesty should move all of us to recognize our limitations and keep unnecessary commitments to a minimum .
Any who feel this way , however , can draw encouragement from the words found at Habakkuk 2 : 3 : “ The vision is yet for the appointed time , and it keeps panting on to the end , and it will not tell a lie . Even if it should delay , keep in expectation of it ; for it will without fail come true . It will not be late . ”
Surely , all of Jehovah’s faithful servants long for the day when tiredness and discouragement will be gone , when all alive will enjoy “ youthful vigor . ”
Even now we can be made mighty on the inside through the action of holy spirit as we participate in invigorating spiritual activities .
Do not let fatigue cause you to miss out on eternal blessings .

What characterizes lionlike and cobralike persecution ?
Yearbook reports describing acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in modern times contain numerous accounts of such tactics .
Lawless mobs , some led by clergymen or political fanatics , have mistreated God’s people in many places .
This type of attack is designed to weaken or corrupt us spiritually .
The sisters ’ response ?
So if the brothers at the branch office have bought cards , that does not make any difference to us .
After taking that courageous stand , the sisters were released .
6 , 7 .
How does Jehovah empower his servants to face persecution ?
That we are persecuted for upholding righteous standards indicates that we have divine approval .
What joy this proof of Jehovah’s blessing brings !
Holy spirit stirred within them a different “ spirit , ” or mental inclination . ​ — Read Numbers 13 : 30 ; 14 : 6 - 10 , 24 .
Even so , thanks to the strength imparted by God’s active force , they do not fear to be different .

Alex tells Steve that he is deeply concerned about what his friend is doing .
He might wonder whom the elders would believe if Steve denied everything .
Still , the situation is not going to improve if Alex keeps quiet about it .
Indeed , it could lead to Steve’s losing his relationship with Jehovah .
He might lovingly approach Steve again and lay bare his fault .
5 : 1 .
If you ever have to handle such a situation , your friend may not at first appreciate your efforts to help .
Pleasing our greatest Friend , Jehovah , is always the right thing to do .
We should never allow place for the Devil in the Christian congregation .

Since we live in “ critical times , ” it is to be expected that sooner or later all of us will have to deal with some kind of trial .
When that occurs , it is important not to panic .
He lost his livelihood , children , friends , and health , and his wife lost confidence in Jehovah .
His message , as well as the substance of Jehovah’s own message to Job , was : “ Stand still and show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God . ”
He is still interested in us .
By prayerful reliance on Jehovah .
During the time of testing that apparently culminated in his martyrdom , Paul wrote : “ The Lord stood near me and infused power into me , that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it ; and I was delivered from the lion’s mouth . ”
Give an example of how Jehovah is empowering his people to face adversities today .
A pioneer named Roxana is one who has seen how Jehovah provides for his people .
Sure enough , on the Monday after the convention , her boss did fire her .
Again she prayed , and she reflected on the fact that God had provided for her spiritually at the convention , so he could surely also provide for her physically .
As she walked home , Roxana saw a “ Help Wanted ” sign for experienced operators of industrial sewing machines , and she applied for a job .
Yet , holy spirit can make us equal to any challenge we might face in our service to God .
Moreover , God’s spirit can impel fellow believers to impart the assistance we need when we need it most .
May all of us continue to seek holy spirit through prayer and study of the Scriptures .

How Would You Answer ?
• How can you prepare to withstand persecution ?
“ Commencing at Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures . ”
Later that evening , they said : “ Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road , as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us ? ”
How Do Unfulfilled Expectations Affect Us ?
They experienced what is described at Proverbs 13 : 12 : “ Expectation postponed is making the heart sick . ”
Rather , dwell on what he has already done . ”
Jesus stated : “ He that exercises faith in me , that one also will do the works that I do ; and he will do works greater than these . ”
Over seven million individuals look forward to surviving the great tribulation .
Jehovah has made Jesus ’ prophetic words about “ works greater than these ” a reality .
What else has Jehovah done for us ?

“ My Mother and I Enjoy a Restored Relationship . ” ​ — NATALIE HAM
Parents spend a lot of time at the hotel , so their children are raised around alcohol abuse , bad language , and cigarette smoke .
From then on , I felt that I had a special relationship with God .
From the little I knew of them , I thought they were too conservative and didn’t know how to have fun .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : At the time we began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses , Craig and I were on the verge of splitting up .
Today , Craig is a wonderful husband , and we have two beautiful children .
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : TUVALU
MY PAST : I was born on Nukulaelae , a beautiful Pacific island that is now part of Tuvalu .
Life on the islands was dominated by pastors who received their religious training at a college in Samoa .
Even if the islanders did not have enough food for their own families , they were obligated to provide for the pastors .
When I was ten , I left home to go to the only government school in the area , which was on another island .
magazines to read .
I read that book several times .
Eventually , I wrote to the missionary on Funafuti , telling him that I was ready to make a change .
Now I have the pleasure of belonging to a religious group who , like the first - century Christians , have no clergy - laity distinction .
They also humbly follow Jesus ’ example and preach to others about God’s Kingdom government .
“ The Witnesses Didn’t Tell Me What to Believe . ” ​ — ALEXANDER SOSKOV
HISTORY : COMBAT INSTRUCTOR
My family lived in a large apartment building , and many of our neighbors worked together in the same factory .
I remember their complaining that I was a very active child and predicting that I would either die an early death or end up at the police station .
My wife began studying the Bible when I did , and we decided to serve Jehovah together .
Now I am confident that I can remain calm , even if someone tries to provoke me .
Over time , I have learned to be patient with people .
I enjoy pouring the strength I have into serving Jehovah God and helping others .
“ I THOUGHT that Jehovah , who knows me so well , could never love me or approve of me . ”
So wrote a faithful Christian woman who has struggled with a lack of self - worth .
He spearheaded the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls despite enemy opposition .
Nehemiah prays : “ Do remember me , O my God , for good . ”
No .
Since God is the Source of life , we should worship only him . ​ — Read Revelation 4 : 11 .
For example , it tells us what God likes and what he does not like , how he treats people , and how he reacts in different situations . ​ — Read Psalm 103 : 7 - 10 .
Does Jehovah care about us ?
The Bible says : “ Far be it from the true God to act wickedly . ” ​ — Job 34 : 10 ; read James 1 : 13 .
God has granted man the dignity of free will .
A later lesson in this series will explain why God allows suffering . ​ — Read Isaiah 11 : 4 .
Loida , * a mother in Mexico , says : “ Condoms are given out at school , so teenagers think having sex is all right ​ — as long as it’s ‘ safe ’ sex . ”
Nobuko , a mother in Japan , says : “ I asked my son what he would do if he and his girlfriend were alone .
Now you have greater worries , such as : ‘ Is my son accessing pornography ? ’
Their son or daughter became adept at hiding the very conduct the parents were trying to prevent .
Clearly , control is not the answer .
A basic measure is to have ongoing discussions with your children and to start when they are young .

We trust what they have to say . ”
The book states : “ They feel too uncertain to form their own opinions .
Of course , as mentioned earlier , simply stating your values does not guarantee that your son or daughter will choose to live by them .
And studies have found that many youths do eventually adopt their parents ’ values even if during the teen years the children seem to have put them in storage .

“ What I have always tried to get across to my teens , ” says a mother in Mexico named Nadia , “ is that sex is beautiful and natural and that Jehovah God gave it to humans for them to enjoy .
“ Reflecting on the mistakes of my youth , ” says a Christian woman in Australia named Emma , “ I can say that just knowing God’s standards doesn’t mean you agree with them .
Understanding the benefits of those standards ​ — and the consequences of violating them — ​ is vital . ”
Reflecting on the physical , emotional , and spiritual dangers of disregarding God’s laws can bolster your teen’s resolve to live by them .
It can help them to come to grips with the question , ‘ Do I want to take charge of my life and be known as someone who has character and integrity , or do I want to be known as a follower ​ — a person who weakly caves in to his desires ? ’ Having good moral values will help your teen answer that question wisely .
“ The instruction related to sexual behavior in the Bible has stood the test of time .
For suggestions on how to initiate a discussion with your children about sex and how to share age - appropriate information , see The Watchtower , November 1 , 2010 , pages 12 - 14 .
Will Sex Improve Our Relationship ? ”
in the April 2010 issue of Awake !
What indications do I have that my teenager has strong moral values ?
When talking to my teenager about sex , do I portray it primarily as a gift of God or as a trap of Satan ?

Why the sadness ?
Because by keeping her father’s vow , she would be giving up the right to marry and have children .
When she returned , her father carried out his vow by sending her to God’s tabernacle at Shiloh for the rest of her life .
Every year , the young women of Israel would go to Shiloh and encourage Jephthah’s daughter .
They want to maintain good health and to prolong life .
In fact , like the first - century Christian Luke , some of Jehovah’s Witnesses are physicians . ​ — Colossians 4 : 14 .
Of course , there are many opinions when it comes to matters of health .
Each individual , therefore , should investigate any proposed treatment and ensure that it does not conflict with his or her Bible - trained conscience . ​ — Galatians 6 : 5 ; Hebrews 5 : 14 .

12 Questions From Readers
A GERMAN proverb states : “ With hat in hand , one goes through all the land . ”
How can they be taught not just to be outwardly polite but to be genuinely respectful ?
Along with the reminders , a good example is absolutely essential .
Everything Jehovah does is orderly .
Christians should strive to imitate this godly quality and keep things tidy in the home .
Your children will tend to reflect the same attitude toward their schoolwork and teachers that you display .
Young Christians who stand out among their schoolmates because of politeness and good conduct are to be commended .
Children can learn to respect their neighbors by observing fine examples of good manners at the Kingdom Hall .
Could you rehearse with your little child such greetings as “ good morning , ” “ good afternoon , ” “ good evening , ” or whatever is customary where you live ?
That was no way to speak to a man who was God’s representative .
Once again , fire came down from the heavens .
That would be unthinkable !
Does that not emphasize the value of showing respect ?
For example , Abigail apologized for the insolent way in which her husband , Nabal , treated David .
David was so impressed with what Abigail did that after Nabal’s death he chose her to be his wife . ​ — 1 Sam .
25 : 23 - 41 .
See Awake ! of October 2007 , pages 3 - 11 .
“ By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made , and by the spirit of his mouth all their army . ” ​ — PS .
It is now thought that the heavens contain over 100 billion galaxies , some consisting of billions of stars .
And we will undoubtedly learn much more about the earth and the heavens in the years ahead .
How did God create the universe , and how do his works glorify him ?
And “ the work of his hands ” ​ — what Jehovah created by means of his holy spirit — ​ brings him great glory .
Our unimaginably vast universe gives evidence that Jehovah’s power and energy are inexhaustible .
Then you throw them out onto the ground all at once .
We find an immense and highly ordered system of galaxies , stars , and planets , all moving with great precision .
So we must ask , What force was originally employed in order to produce our orderly universe ?
And with our eyes , we can see only a very small part of that “ army ” of stars as we survey the night sky !
Early on the third creative day , Jehovah used his holy spirit to produce dry land , perhaps harnessing powerful geologic forces to push continents up out of the global sea .
Thus , living things provide countless examples of complexity , symmetry , and beauty that bespeak design of the highest level .
Although the earth’s creatures differ widely , the code that controls many of their inherited characteristics is very stable and has served to maintain the distinction between basic kinds of creatures down through the ages .
How did God create man ?
He was about to produce his highest earthly creation .
Being made in God’s image means that Jehovah created us with the ability to display love , to exercise free will , and even to establish a personal relationship with our Creator .
Jehovah provided abundant food and a paradise home for them .
They had the opportunity to live forever and become the beloved parents of billions of perfect descendants .
Acknowledging the Role of Holy Spirit
We should pray to Jehovah for holy spirit .
We should not let this flood of faulty thinking confuse or intimidate us .
Faith in the Bible and in God himself is sure to be strengthened by an honest examination of the evidence in favor of creation .
In contemplating the origin of the universe and mankind , many would like to rule out the influence of any force outside the physical realm .
If we were to discuss matters from that standpoint , though , we would not be weighing all the evidence impartially .
Moreover , we would be ignoring the obvious existence of orderly , purposeful creations “ without number . ”
Holy Spirit and Our Faith in God
( a ) Why did God create the universe and man ?
May each of us keep on learning about Jehovah and his great works and reflect in our lives the boundless love he showed when he used his holy spirit to create the heavens , the earth , and mankind . [ Footnote ] See pages 24 and 25 of the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You ?

It Is Worth the Effort !
FAMILY WORSHIP and Bible study are essential if children are to be brought up “ in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah . ”
If you are a parent , though , you know that young ones can easily become bored .
We also played ‘ guess who I am ’ Bible games and created a Bible board game with questions of varying difficulty .
It was like a treasure hunt !
A shoe box and a red ribbon became Rahab’s house with a scarlet cord .
But family worship and Bible study can be a base for other spiritual instruction .
Why did Moses become angry with Aaron’s sons Eleazar and Ithamar after the death of their brothers Nadab and Abihu , and how was his anger appeased ? ​ — Lev .
Moses ordered Aaron’s surviving sons not to mourn their dead brothers .
On discovering that the goat of the sin offering had been burned , he indignantly asked Eleazar and Ithamar why they had not eaten it as directed , because its blood had not been presented before Jehovah in the Holy Place . ​ — Lev .
In the light of the execution of two of his sons , Aaron may have wondered whether any of the priests could in good conscience eat of the sin offering on that day .
Aaron may especially have reasoned that on the day when members of his family first performed their priestly duties , they should have exercised great care to please God in even the smallest detail .
Moses seems to have accepted his brother’s answer , for the passage concludes : “ When Moses got to hear that , then it proved satisfactory in his eyes . ”
Evidently , Jehovah too was satisfied with Aaron’s answer .
What request did Elijah make of the widow in Zarephath , and what assurance did he give her ?
17 : 13 , 14 .
The issue before the widow was more critical than deciding what to do with her last bit of food .
Would she trust in Jehovah to save her and her son , or would she put her material needs ahead of gaining God’s approval and friendship ?
A similar question stands before all of us .
( b ) What will Christ’s sacrifice do for those who seek God’s approval ?
Acting in harmony with his Father’s will , Jesus Christ gave “ his soul a ransom in exchange for many . ”
Having his approval , we will be able to see how he works to undo all the damage done to the human race .
“ Your People Will Offer Themselves Willingly ”
Jehovah knows that serving him whole - souled is good for us .
Moses urged the Israelites to choose life ‘ by loving Jehovah their God , by listening to his voice and by sticking to him . ’ ​ — Deut .
The zeal with which they preach the good news proves where their priorities lie .
Sacrifices That Meet With God’s Approval
“ In case you should sacrifice a communion sacrifice to Jehovah , ” says Leviticus 19 : 5 , “ you should sacrifice it to gain approval for yourselves . ”
( Read Psalm 34 : 1 - 3 . )
14 : 1 , 2 .
What about you ?
Be assured that “ the restful odor ” of your sacrifice of praise will reach Jehovah and that he will grant you his approval .
Today , Satan eggs people on to believe that nothing is to be gained by doing God’s will .
Those who now follow their bad example will soon come to realize the same bitter truth . ​ — Gen .
17 : 15 , 16 .
( Read Joshua 21 : 43 - 45 ; 23 : 14 . )
Should we not seek God’s approval ?
• Why does Jehovah deserve our heartfelt worship ?
• What sacrifices does Jehovah accept today ?
• Why should we seek God’s approval ?
[ Picture on page 15 ]
What benefit do we receive by offering a sacrifice of praise to Jehovah ?
Why ?
Centuries later , King David of ancient Israel sang : “ As for me , in your loving - kindness I have trusted ; let my heart be joyful in your salvation . I will sing to Jehovah , for he has dealt rewardingly with me . ”
Think of what will then happen to our good relationship with Jehovah .
When a young Witness named Paul thought about his prayers , he realized that he needed to make some improvements .
As Paul did research on the subject in the Watch Tower Publications Index , he learned that there are about 180 prayers recorded in the Bible .
In these , Jehovah’s servants of the past expressed their innermost feelings .
However , we must be on guard against allowing unwholesome influences to cause us to lose our enthusiasm for the truth .
For example , paying attention to apostate propaganda can becloud our thinking and blind us to the value of the spiritual “ food at the proper time ” made available by Jehovah through “ the faithful and discreet slave . ” ​ — Matt .
24 : 45 - 47 .
Thus , I decided to start reading our publications again and to attend the meetings .
Our loving , united brotherhood is a blessing from Jehovah .
For instance , it is easy to be annoyed at the imperfections of someone and to adopt a critical attitude toward that one .
Nothing out there in the world is worth abandoning our spiritual paradise for . ”
Our hope in God’s Kingdom as the solution for all mankind’s problems is a treasure of inestimable value .
Similarly , let us never lose appreciation for our wonderful hope . ​ — 1 Thess .
We have sound reasons for being grateful for the many spiritual blessings we enjoy .
Under God’s Kingdom , physical blessings will be added to our spiritual blessings .
Names have been changed .
We are blessed with spiritual support in times of trial
“ To Obey Is Better Than a Sacrifice ”
What wrongs did Saul commit ?
Before Saul became king , the prophet Samuel was serving as God’s representative in Israel .
Saul was “ young and handsome . ”
He was also humble .
For example , Saul asked Samuel : “ Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel , and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ?
Jehovah indicated where he was , and Saul was proclaimed king . ​ — 1 Sam .
But Saul ascribed this triumph to God , saying : “ Today Jehovah has performed salvation in Israel . ” ​ — 1 Sam .
What could the Israelites be sure of if they were faithful to God ?
“ Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name , ” said Samuel , “ because Jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people . ” ​ — 1 Sam .
Saul’s next action against the Philistines provoked a strong reaction from them .
“ The men of Israel themselves saw that they were in sore straits , because the people were hard pressed ; and the people went hiding themselves in the caves and the hollows and the crags and the vaults and the waterpits . ”
Saul waited , but Samuel was late in coming , and Saul’s army was scattering .
10 : 8 ; 13 : 8 , 13 , 14 .
Lacking faith , Saul presumptuously chose to disobey God’s command to wait for Samuel to come to offer the sacrifice .
Jehovah directed Gideon to reduce his army from 32,000 to 300 , and Gideon obeyed .
Why ?
Because he had faith in Jehovah .
Because of Saul’s disobedience , however , the Philistines pillaged Israel . ​ — 1 Sam .
God had condemned the people of Amalek because of their unprovoked attack on the Israelites following the Exodus from Egypt .
Saul was no longer so ‘ little in his own eyes . ’
Saul tried to hunt him down and even ordered the death of 85 priests and others .
When the Philistines again attacked Israel , Saul turned to spiritism in a fruitless search for help .
“ This is what the love of God means , ” wrote the apostle John , “ that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ”
May we never neglect this fundamental truth : Lasting friendship with God depends on our obedience to him .
Saul started out as a humble leader
“ You have loved righteousness . ” ​ — PS .
45 : 7 .
Since we are imperfect , however , we tend to deviate from that path .
Like Jesus , we must love doing what is right . ​ — Read Psalm 45 : 7 .
50 : 7 .
Seek God’s Righteousness
Read Matthew 6 : 33 .
What can help us to overcome debilitating discouragement and learn to love and practice righteousness ?
The article stated : “ It is a singular fact , that [ when ] a scarlet or crimson object [ is ] viewed through a red glass in the light , the object appears white ; so , though our sins be as scarlet or crimson , when we come where God will view them through the blood of Christ , they are accounted as white . ”
Satan is angry , and he knows that his time is limited .
Because of our imperfect nature , our figurative heart tends to be treacherous and desperate .
If we appreciate our need for “ the breastplate of righteousness , ” we will not temporarily remove it by choosing to be entertained by what God hates ; nor will we allow ourselves to fantasize about engaging in wrongdoing .
In turn , faith and wholehearted love for Jehovah help us to practice righteousness and remain on the road to everlasting life .
How do we benefit from maintaining a good conscience ?
Although he thought that Jehovah would not listen to his prayer , he prayed anyway and asked for forgiveness .
Less than ten minutes later , his mother visited him and encouraged him to return to the meetings .
In time , he was baptized , and he is thankful to Jehovah for saving his life .
The day is coming when all humans will experience only feelings of pleasure from their conscience ; they will perfectly reflect God’s image .
Let us , therefore , now implant a love of righteousness deep in our heart and cause Jehovah to rejoice . ​ — Prov .
How can we train our conscience ?
What can we do to train our conscience ?
If a certain type of work is plainly in conflict with Scriptural requirements , most of us quickly respond to the direction provided through the faithful and discreet slave class .
When the answer to an employment question is not clear - cut , however , Bible principles should be noted and considered prayerfully .
78 : 40 , 41 .
Do we find ourselves always quickly underlining the answer to a study question and moving on to the next paragraph ?
Such study sessions are unlikely to deepen our love for righteousness or to develop within us a sensitive conscience .
If we are to come to love righteousness , we need to study diligently and meditate on what we read in God’s written Word .
Why , a love of righteousness !
The ungodly will soon be removed , and lovers of righteousness will no longer experience the distress caused by law - defying people and their evil deeds .
Jehovah , the Most High , knows what is taking place and will soon deliver lovers of righteousness .
Psalm 146 : 8 emphasizes an outstanding benefit of following the path of righteousness .
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Proverbs 10 : 3 . )
Eventually , this entire planet will be enjoyed by lovers of righteousness .
That includes keeping “ the breastplate of righteousness ” firmly in place to protect our figurative heart .
How Would You Answer ?
STRESSING the importance of love , Jesus Christ told his disciples : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ”
In addition to teaching his disciples about love , however , Jesus taught them what to hate .
It was said with reference to Jesus : “ You loved righteousness , and you hated lawlessness [ wickedness ] . ”
Why did Jesus enjoy freeness of speech when warning about heavy drinking ?
Jesus occasionally drank wine , recognizing it as a gift from God .
Do I become defensive or even resentful ? ’
While on earth , Jesus firmly opposed Satan and the demons .
As a result , Satan is ​ — now more than ever — ​ bent on “ misleading the entire inhabited earth . ”
It should come as no surprise to us , then , that fascination with the occult is widespread and is growing .
The Bible clearly warns of the dangers connected with spiritism .
Today , Satan and the demons influence people’s thinking through movies , books , and electronic games that promote occult practices .
When selecting entertainment , therefore , each of us should ask himself : ‘ Over the past months , have I chosen to be entertained by films , TV programs , electronic games , books , or comics that feature uncanny practices ?
Have I even considered how Jehovah might feel about my choice of entertainment ?
If I have opened the door to such satanic influences , will my love for Jehovah and his righteous principles impel me to act decisively and slam that door shut ? ’ ​ — Acts 19 : 19 , 20 .
So that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
Relate an experience showing that an individual can break free from pornography .
Music and its accompanying lyrics can strongly influence our emotions and , therefore , our figurative heart .
You might start by asking yourself : ‘ Do the songs I listen to glorify murder , adultery , fornication , and blasphemy ?
If I were to read the lyrics of certain songs to someone , would that person get the impression that I hate lawlessness , or would the words indicate that my heart is defiled ? ’
How , though , did he view those who became hardened in a course of sin ?
He also clearly stated : “ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will .
However , he will reject those who unrepentantly practice lawlessness , saying : “ Get away from me . ”
Why such a judgment ?
Loyalty to Jehovah calls for an answer to what searching questions ?
What difficulty did a Christian mother face , and what helped her to uphold the arrangement for disfellowshipping unrepentant wrongdoers ?
She took the reminders to heart and loyally upheld the disfellowshipping arrangement .
What may seem harsh to outsiders is both necessary and really a loving thing to do . ”
Do you think that this person would have been helped to come to such a conclusion had members of the congregation , including her family , maintained regular contact with her while she was disfellowshipped ?
Why is it important to learn to hate lawlessness ?
Because “ your adversary , the Devil , walks about like a roaring lion , seeking to devour someone . ”
By imitating Jesus Christ and developing deep love for Jehovah God , however , we can succeed in cultivating hatred for lawlessness .

Elsewhere , a Methodist bishop lamented that his churches are divided and confused , lacking the nerve to carry out their mission and holding much the same values as does society in general .
You will find it in the next article .
Who Are Preaching the Good News ?
They do this in a variety of ways .
They preach to people of all walks of life .
Books , brochures , tracts , CDs / ​ MP3s , and DVDs that explain Bible teachings are available in some 540 languages .
The Witnesses have produced and distributed more than 20 billion of these items in just the past ten years , averaging about three for every individual living on earth !
Talks are given on subjects pertaining to the Bible , and the Bible is studied with the help of the Watchtower magazine and other publications .
At the meetings , Witnesses also learn to be more effective proclaimers of the good news .
The Witnesses study the same material in over 107,000 congregations throughout the earth , contributing to their unity .
Therefore , they try to recommend the good news . . .
Commenting on Matthew 24 : 14 , one theologian wrote these dire words : “ This verse is one of the most important in all the Word of God . . .
Consider an illustration .
Suppose you owned a beautiful home and allowed people to live in it for free .
Would you destroy your home ?
You would probably evict the bad tenants and repair what damage had been done .
But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth , and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 9 - 11 .
The apostle Peter spoke about the same subject .
Under inspiration , he wrote : “ There were heavens from of old and an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God , and by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water . ”
Here the apostle refers to the Flood of Noah’s day .
That global Deluge set “ a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come . ” ​ — 2 Peter 2 : 6 .
Peter wrote : “ There are new heavens [ God’s Messianic Kingdom ] and a new earth [ a righteous human society ] that we are awaiting according to his promise , and in these righteousness is to dwell . ” ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 7 , 13 .
Read Matthew 24 : 3 - 14 and 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 to see features that prove this to be true .
Also , God has hidden his purposes from the haughty and has revealed them to humble ones .
[ Picture on page 9 ]

God sent his Son to earth by transferring his life from heaven to the womb of a virgin Jewess named Mary .
So Jesus did not have a human father .
Death and old age were not part of God’s original purpose for mankind .
Who could pay the ransom to free us from death ?
When we die , we pay the penalty only for our own sins .
After Jesus died , God restored him to life as a spirit person .
Job , a man of outstanding faith , undergoes severe trials ​ — including the loss of his material possessions , the death of all his beloved children , and a painful illness .
In the throes of misery , he calls out to God : “ O that in Sheol [ mankind’s common grave ] you would conceal me ! ”
There , as if a treasure hidden by God , he will be free of hardship and pain .
Why is Job convinced that his relief will come ?
Says Job : “ You will call , and I myself shall answer you . For the work of your hands you will have a yearning . ”
Thankfully , in the book of Job ​ — one of the first Bible books to be written — ​ Jehovah saw fit to reveal his purpose to resurrect the dead .
* He wants to reunite you with your loved ones who have died .
The O’dam , a very isolated ethnic group , live high in the Sierras in north central Mexico , some 150 miles ( 240 km ) from the nearest congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
There we made camp , gathered enough wood for a bonfire to ward off wild animals , and slept in three - hour shifts to keep the fire going .
This was surprising but encouraging news .
With blistered feet , we arrived at Los Arenales .
They use such charms as eagle feathers and bones , worship the forces of nature , and live in fear of the shamans , who exploit them .
“ I told them that first they had to burn all their amulets and idols , ” said Melesio .
Although it was midweek and on short notice , 25 came , arriving on foot and on burro .
They begged us to send someone to teach them more .

20 Never Forsake Your Fellow Believers
Do Not Deceive Yourself With False Reasoning
“ WHAT is this you have done ? ” God asked Eve after she had eaten from the forbidden tree .
“ The serpent ​ — it deceived me and so I ate , ” she replied .
The thought of deceiving ourselves may seem highly improbable or even impossible .
The divine warning , however , is obviously there for a purpose .
They concluded that God did not want the temple built immediately .
Recall , though , that Haggai and Zechariah helped the Jews to understand that Jehovah still wanted the temple rebuilt without delay .
He wrote : “ I am arousing your clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder . ”
Haggai gave a similar exhortation to the disheartened , inactive Jews in 520 B.C.E .
Soon after that encouragement , construction work restarted ​ — despite the official prohibition .
The ban was rescinded , and in five years the temple was completed . ​ — Ezra 6 : 14 , 15 ; Hag .
1 : 14 , 15 .
Could you see that happening to you ?
Weeding Out False Reasoning
First , compare what Mark and Luke wrote .
Here we note the seeming contradiction .
Likely , each apostle was wearing one undergarment .
Mark highlighted the need “ to bind on sandals , ” the sandals they were already wearing .
Mark mentioned that the apostles were to “ carry nothing for the trip ” except the staff that they had with them when Jesus gave the command .
Why did he give such a command ?
Because “ the worker deserves his food . ”
Why ?
We cannot be sure , but one possibility is that they were notable women that Solomon encountered at his royal court .
He added : “ I accumulated also silver and gold for myself , and property peculiar to kings and the jurisdictional districts . I made male singers and female singers for myself and the exquisite delights of the sons of mankind , a lady , even ladies . ” ​ — Eccl .
When Solomon wrote these words , he already was acquainted with the “ lady , even ladies . ”
He obviously knew the words for “ wife , ” “ queen , ” and “ concubine , ” because he used those words in his inspired writings .
In the words “ lady , even ladies , ” we find the only instances ( singular and plural ) in the Bible of an unusual Hebrew word .
The rendering “ lady , even ladies ” conveys that sense .
Because of Adam’s choice , mankind was sold into sin , thus inheriting a tendency to be influenced by Satan’s spirit of disobedience . ​ — Read Ephesians 2 : 1 - 3 .
Satan also influenced a considerable number of angels , who became demons .
Many are blind to Satan’s influence , but there is no need for true Christians to be ignorant of his tactics .
In fact , the spirit of the world cannot influence us unless we allow it to do so .
Let us examine four questions that will help to reveal whether we are being influenced by God’s spirit or by that of the world .
The Devil knows that Jehovah hates anyone who loves violence .
What questions regarding entertainment should we ask ourselves ?
The wisdom from above is “ not hypocritical . ”
Jehovah expects exclusive devotion .
We might ask ourselves : ‘ Does the entertainment I choose make it possible for me to give God exclusive devotion ?
10 , 11 . ( a ) Regarding material possessions , what attitude does the spirit of the world promote ?
What is my attitude toward material possessions ?
Such ones are known as givers , not takers .
A real test as to which spirit influences us comes , not when things are going well , but when they are not , such as if a Christian brother or sister ignores us , offends us , or even sins against us .
Instead , we will put forth effort to become “ tenderly compassionate . ” ​ — Eph .
The spirit of the world reflects rebellion against God’s Word .
Some disregard God’s Word altogether .
To receive God’s spirit , we must develop in ourselves “ the mind of Christ . ”
( b ) Why should we “ keep on asking ” ?
Jesus always did the things pleasing to his Father .
Ask yourself , ‘ Do I obey God even when doing so is not easy ? ’
Are you making wise use of this arrangement ?
To help you gain the mind of Christ , could you include in your study session a systematic consideration of what Jesus taught on subjects of your choice ?
Such resistance does not come easily .
It can be a struggle , a hard fight .
[ Footnote ]
26 : 4 .
What contrast is there between God’s servants and people in the world ?
Joshua of old attested to God’s trustworthiness .
Concerning the divine name , the introduction to The Emphasized Bible , by J .
To this Name , God will ever be faithful ; of it He will never be ashamed . ”
How can we show that trust when temptations arise ?
How can we strengthen our resolve to reject bad thoughts ?
He refused to be influenced by the wicked ridiculers around him .
Rather , he stuck to the Source of life - sustaining “ water ” and took to heart everything Jehovah told him .
20 : 9 ) What a fine example Jeremiah is for us , especially those of us who serve God in difficult territories !
Do you take full advantage of these provisions ?
When literal flooding occurs , a common reaction is to run to higher ground or to climb onto the roof of a building ​ — anywhere of higher elevation .
Similarly , as the world’s problems mount , millions seek refuge in seemingly lofty financial , political , or religious institutions , as well as in science and technology .
We cling to Jehovah when we heed his Word , which often runs contrary to human wisdom .
‘ Make a lot of money . ’
Godly wisdom , on the other hand , is in line with the advice : “ [ Let ] those making use of the world [ be ] as those not using it to the full ; for the scene of this world is changing . ”
6 : 19 , 20 .
With 1 John 2 : 15 - 17 in mind , what should we ask ourselves ?
Are spiritual riches and privileges of Kingdom service more desirable and important to you than the things the world offers ?
But he does expect his servants to trust fully in him ​ — not in Satan’s dying world . ​ — Heb .
13 : 5 .
How have some benefited by maintaining a ‘ simple eye ’ and keeping Kingdom interests in first place ?
Consider the example of Richard and Ruth , parents of three young children .
“ I had a comfortable life but felt that I was just giving God my surplus , as it were .
My request was approved , and I started working the new schedule within one month . ”
How does Richard feel now ?
We pioneered before we had our son and daughter , and we never lost the desire to pioneer .
In view of life’s uncertainties , how have the Scriptures comforted you ?
Many brothers and sisters in trying situations have experienced inner calm and peace from Jehovah .
Then and at other times , I prayed silently to Jehovah , and his peace came over me .
I felt like a rock .
Why will Jehovah’s servants reside in security when Satan’s world comes to its end ?
Gold , silver , and other valuable things will provide no security whatsoever .
1 : 33 .

“ Jehovah is the Rock of times indefinite ”
Prove Yourself Ready !
For no apparent reason , one of his animals , a 380 - pound ( 172 kg ) white tiger , attacked him .
( Read Revelation 17 : 15 - 18 . )
The scarlet - colored wild beast represents the United Nations , and “ the ten horns ” represent all the political powers .
These will turn on the harlotlike Babylon the Great , the world empire of false religion , and violently destroy her .
It is vital , then , that we keep ourselves spiritually ready so that when that attack occurs and Christ comes as Executioner , he will also prove to be our Deliverer !
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah then issued a divine decree that marked the beginning of the end for that ungodly world . ​ — Read Genesis 6 : 3 , 5 , 11 , 12 .
Behind the scenes , these sex perverts derive pleasure from the evil and debased actions of those whom they can corrupt on the earth . ​ — Eph .
His power is limited when it comes to causing death directly .
He plants murderous attitudes in the hearts and minds of people .
For example , 1 out of every 142 children born in the United States will become a murder victim .
Deep faith and godly fear moved Noah and his family to do as God commanded .
Therefore , they had personally given evidence of their love for God and his ways .
As they built the ark , they must have gone in and out of it hundreds of times .
What might Noah’s family have felt ?
Can you picture yourself on the other side of Armageddon , your heart swelling with similar appreciation ?
Ask yourself , ‘ Do I have absolute confidence that none of God’s promises will fail even in the slightest detail and that all of them will be fulfilled at his appointed time ? ’
Moses Remained Alert
What could have blurred Moses ’ spiritual vision ?
( Read Acts 7 : 20 - 22 . )
After all , Moses told the sons of Israel : “ Jehovah . . . the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ” ​ — Read Exodus 3 : 15 - 17 .
Despite setbacks , what moved Moses to remain watchful for opportunities to honor his heavenly Father ?
Yet , he watched for opportunities to honor Jehovah and wholeheartedly encouraged his fellow Israelites to do so .
Why does Mark 13 : 35 - 37 have profound meaning for you ?
Do we have any doubt that we need to “ keep awake ” and “ keep looking ” for the foretold end and our deliverance ?
Let us take to heart the examples that we have considered and stay watchful for opportunities to defend and honor Jehovah as “ the God of gods , ” yes , “ the God great , mighty and fear - inspiring . ” ​ — Deut .

As to the “ hundred and twenty years ” mentioned at Genesis 6 : 3 , see The Watchtower , December 15 , 2010 , page 30 .
• What Bible prophecies move you to stay awake spiritually ?
[ Picture on page 25 ]
Its lovely pink or white flowers can be seen as early as the end of January or the beginning of February .
If we have any doubts about Jehovah’s sure promises , now is the time for us to awaken from any spiritual drowsiness .
Examining how and why Jeremiah kept awake to his God - given assignment will help us to see how we can persevere in the work that Jehovah has given us .
An Urgent Message
He had scathing denunciations and fearful judgments to proclaim , especially to the priests , false prophets , and rulers , as well as to those who took “ the popular course ” and developed “ an enduring unfaithfulness . ”
His day will come exactly on time , at an hour that humans do not expect . ​ — Zeph .
How does that affect you ?
Jesus indicated that all need to take a stand for God’s Kingdom .
Love for People
He had love for people .
He wanted his countrymen to hear God’s words and live .
( Read Jeremiah 8 : 21 ; 9 : 1 . )
9 : 36 .
He was long - suffering and kind , even toward corrupt King Zedekiah !
After Zedekiah turned him over to be put to death , Jeremiah still pleaded with him to obey the voice of Jehovah .
Truly , Jehovah was with the prophet “ like a terrible mighty one ” in that he supported Jeremiah and gave him the strength to handle his assignment .
As “ King of the nations , ” Jehovah commissioned Jeremiah to deliver a judgment message to nations and kingdoms .
The Jeremiah class is determined not to relent in its God - given commission to proclaim Jehovah’s judgment messages earth wide .
It is not unusual to get discouraged at times in the face of opposition , indifference , or difficult circumstances .
The Jeremiah class will declare not just “ the year of goodwill on the part of Jehovah ” but also “ the day of vengeance on the part of our God . ” ​ — Isa .
Heartfelt Joy
Why may we conclude that Jeremiah maintained his joy , and what was a key element in his doing so ?
When he turned his attention to the beauty and importance of his message , his joy was rekindled . ​ — Jer .

His work of building and planting bore fruitage .
Great is the pleasure of the Jeremiah class in spiritually building up this “ great crowd . ”
Likewise , these loyal companions of the anointed find immense satisfaction in assisting honesthearted ones to come to a knowledge of the truth .
By now that “ short while ” must be near its completion .
2 : 3 .
Ask yourself : ‘ Does my life truly reflect the urgency of our times ?
Or do my decisions and priorities indicate that I do not expect the end anytime soon or even that I am not sure if it will ever come ? ’
They have their “ loins girded about with truth ” in that they allow God’s Word to strengthen them until their commissioned work is completed .
With similar determination , those of the great crowd actively support the Jeremiah class in carrying out its divine assignment .
Now is not the time to slow down in Kingdom activity but to consider the import of Jeremiah 12 : 5 .
( Read . )
What are you determined to do ?
The beautiful almond blossom reminds us that Jehovah will ‘ keep awake ’ concerning his word in order to carry it out .
Do You Recall ?
• What helped Jeremiah maintain his joy ?
Jehovah’s dealings with the Israelites were not to be forgotten history .
Certainly , many Israelite fathers followed Moses ’ command .
44 : 1 .
To a young person today , the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses over the last 100 years or so may also seem like “ the days of long ago . ”
To do so , some parents use Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom , the Yearbook , life stories published in our journals , and other reports of theocratic history , including our new DVD about God’s people in modern times .
So get your children involved .
For example , you might ask your son to choose a country that interests him , research the theocratic history of that land , and present some of what he learned to his family .
For instance , if the circuit overseer will soon visit your congregation , why not consider with your family the duties and privileges of traveling overseers ?
How do they help each one of us ?
“ Inspect Its Dwelling Towers ”
“ March around Zion , you people , and go about it , count its towers .
What convinced her that the things she had heard were true ?
If there is a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses near your home , make an effort to visit it .
Mandy and Bethany , for example , grew up some 900 miles ( 1,500 km ) from the Bethel home in their country .
We have another way to “ see ” Jehovah’s organization , a way that was unavailable to ancient Israel .
Every congregation of God’s people plays an important role in preaching the good news and supporting Christians in its locality .

Never Forsake Your Fellow Believers
Although we were raised in the truth , we had strayed too far and had no spiritual strength to return , ” relate Jarosław and his wife , Beata .
In a world where the cost of living is rising relentlessly and unemployment is increasing steadily , some individuals become desperate and , as a result , make unwise decisions .
9 : 11 , 12 .
Consider seriously this aspect of the matter .
Some may lack basic material sustenance .
“ Whoever has this world’s means for supporting life and beholds his brother having need and yet shuts the door of his tender compassions upon him , in what way does the love of God remain in him ? ” ​ — 1 John 3 : 17 .
You may have responded to such needs and extended generous help to others .
In that way overseers imitate the apostle Paul , who had “ tender affection ” for his spiritual brothers and sisters . ​ — 1 Thess .
I left just for three months , then for another three months , and so on , with short intervals back home .
My unbelieving wife suffered emotionally from that . ”
Not even having time to take care of myself , I began to doubt my ability to serve others . ”
The sad consequences of Marek’s decision should move us to stop and think .
For instance , what would happen to the spiritual and emotional well - being of our family ?
Would such a move lead to the severing of our ties with the congregation ?
Consider Jarosław and Beata .
Excited over the profits we were making , we opened a large shop and entered into a partnership with an unbeliever .
Soon I was traveling abroad to sign contracts worth millions of dollars .
Yet , we all do well to consider seriously how much is really needed in life .
Granted , the standard of living varies from country to country .
Establishing priorities can move us to find more time for Kingdom interests , including personal study .
That was a real eye - opener ! ” ​ — Prov .
6 : 14 .
“ Over the years , my situation resembled the one of Baruch of old who ‘ kept seeking great things for himself . ’
Marek is now reaching out for the “ fine work ” of an overseer in the congregation . ​ — 1 Tim .
3 : 1 .
Marek gives this warning for those who might consider traveling abroad in search of a better - paying job : “ When abroad , it is very easy to fall into the traps of this wicked world .
Does your secular work interfere with your meeting attendance ?
[ Pictures on page 23 ]
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you .
What is God’s purpose for the earth ?
After creating angels to live in heaven , God made man to enjoy the earth .
Paradise was lost , and no man has succeeded in restoring it .
The Bible says : “ Earth itself has been given into the hand of the wicked one . ” ​ — Job 9 : 24 ; read Genesis 3 : 23 , 24 .
He will restore the human race to the way he meant it to be . ​ — Read Psalm 37 : 11 .
Draw Close to God
When Old Ones Will Be Young Again
WHO of us welcomes the effects of old age ​ — wrinkled skin , poor eyesight , loss of hearing , and unsteady legs ?
Rather , he has lovingly purposed to release us from the aging process !
Unknown to Job , Satan questioned Job’s integrity , saying that he served God only for selfish reasons .
Satan then “ struck Job with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head . ”
Let his flesh become fresher than in youth ; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor . ”
Job humbly accepted correction , and he repented .
All who put faith in that ransom have the prospect of living forever on a paradise earth .
In that coming new world , God will release faithful humans from the aging process .
In Job’s case , the ransom might have been an animal sacrifice , which God would accept to cover , or atone for , Job’s error . ​ — Job 1 : 5 .
MANY people today feel lonely ; they feel that nobody really cares about them .
Older people often feel this way .
But lots of children today , even many who serve God , also feel lonely and afraid .
Elijah said : “ I only am left . ”
But do you think that Elijah really was the only one still serving Jehovah ? —
But they had gone into hiding .
They were afraid .
Jehovah once answered Elijah’s prayer to send fire from heaven to eat up a sacrifice .
“ What is your business here ? ”
Jehovah then kindly corrected Elijah , saying , ‘ I have yet seven thousand who serve me . ’
So all of us , young and old alike , need to remember to turn to Jehovah for help .
The Bible promises : “ Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him . ”
1 Kings 19 : 3 - 18
The Bible Changes Lives
HISTORY : ANTISOCIAL PUNK ROCKER
MY PAST : On my father’s side , my family is Irish , and I grew up as an Irish Catholic .
I bought a Bible and started studying it on my own .
We would meet with adherents of such religions and ask them a series of questions .
But after months of such meetings , I still had not found a group that answered our questions from the Bible ; nor did I have a desire to meet with any of them again .
So we went on to ask questions for which we had not yet found answers in the Bible ​ — for example , about God’s view of smoking and drugs .
We agreed to go to a meeting at the Kingdom Hall .
But as always , I prayed to God that he would give me a desire to meet with these people again if they represented the true religion , and I felt an overwhelming desire to study the Bible with the Witnesses .
I tried several times to stop smoking but failed .
Thereafter , with Jehovah’s help , I was able to stop smoking .
Later , I dyed it bright orange .
His compassion and care have impelled me to imitate him and to follow his Son , Jesus Christ , as my model in life .
YEAR BORN : 1964
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : MEXICO
I usually went barefoot because we had no money to buy shoes .
Eventually , I took a course to become a hair stylist and ran a beauty shop .
They treated each other with kindness .
People in general made fun of me but not the Witnesses .
In fact , I had to undergo a complete metamorphosis , for I was living a feminine life .
Jehovah helped people back then to make changes , and he helped me too .
I serve as an elder in the congregation , and I have been able to help others to learn the truth of God’s Word .
However , Jehovah truly helped me .
Although I felt unworthy , he noticed me and treated me with love and patience .
“ I Felt Dissatisfied , Lonely , and Empty . ” ​ — KAZUHIRO KUNIMOCHI
I planned to make a lot of money so that I could give my family a secure and settled life .
I was very competitive .
She said she wanted to attend the meetings of the Witnesses , so I decided that we would go as a family .
I can still remember the night when an elder called at my home and began to study the Bible with me .
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE : I will never forget how reading Ephesians 5 : 5 affected me .
My conscience became troubled .
I felt that if I wanted to please Jehovah God , I would need to quit racing .
I was also at a loss as to how to support my family .
My father was bitterly disappointed .
We have never lacked the “ other things ” that Jesus referred to , the basic necessities of life .
Better still , when I work or worship with my fellow believers , I find joy and satisfaction that I never knew before .
My family life has improved greatly as well .
My three sons and their wives have all become faithful servants of Jehovah .

“ The Fruitage of the Spirit ” Glorifies God
This article will help us examine why it is vital that we learn how to make good decisions .
You will find answers to these questions as we consider the nine aspects of the spirit’s fruitage .
WE LIVE in a world that is experiencing some of the most difficult and tragic times in human history .
To cope with the stresses of life , people often put the desire for pleasures in first place .
How can we avoid that ?
Its emphasis on having a good time can be a threat to our spirituality .
Indeed , because of the shortness of life , we need to ‘ exert ourselves vigorously ’ to attain salvation .
For example , in imitation of Jehovah and Jesus , Christians take seriously their responsibility to work hard .
Jehovah has never taken true worship lightly .
Our field ministry is a source of joy .
However , in order to maintain joy in the ministry , we need to give it serious thought and advance preparation .
Thus , he was able to give them encouragement and incentive to worship Jehovah .
He was willing to “ slave ” both for Jehovah and for those who would listen to the message of truth .
How can we imitate Jesus ’ balanced manner ?
Can that be said of you ?
But if he is serious all the time , it is difficult to approach him . ”
Never would elders want to diminish the joyful view that all believers should have of their worship of Jehovah , “ the happy God . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
What does it mean to be “ reaching out ” in the congregation ?
When Paul encouraged the men in the congregation to strive to qualify for greater responsibility , his intention was not to encourage anyone to satisfy personal ambition .
You can also show an interest in the appearance of the Kingdom Hall , helping to keep it clean and neat .
Like Timothy , you can learn to care genuinely for the needs of the congregation . ​ — Read Philippians 2 : 19 - 22 .
Seriousness includes according our brothers and sisters dignity .
A serious Christian would never toy with the emotions of one of the opposite sex . ​ — Prov .
5 : 23 ; 1 Cor .
Of course , a Christian wife should be supporting the Family Worship arrangement and be cooperating with her husband to make it a success .
What a pleasure it is to be part of such a large association of people who worship Jehovah “ with all seriousness ” !
• Explain why dignifying our brothers and family members is a serious matter .
14 : 15 .
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
WE LIKELY make dozens of them each day .
Many are of little lasting consequence .
What should we not allow to interfere with our decision - making process ?
They may lie , cheat , or steal and then try to persuade us to “ follow after the crowd ” by joining them or at least by covering up for them .
13 : 5 .
Why might others want to make decisions for us ?
( Read Colossians 2 : 6 , 7 . )
Those concerns are understandable .
Because the Bible can “ give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness , to a young man knowledge and thinking ability . ” ​ — Prov .
No .
We can be decisive despite past mistakes if , like David , we remember that Jehovah will overlook our errors and forgive our sins .
Explain .
Should we be concerned with how others view the decisions that we make ?
We too need to consider how our decisions will affect the consciences of others .
11 : 2 .
Parents may grant their children the opportunity to make some decisions , but children should not just assume such authority .
Wives and mothers have a measure of authority within the family but do well to recognize the headship of their husbands .
Do not let emotion rule .
But by doing so , you may avoid making hasty decisions that lead to unnecessary anxiety .
( a ) What assurance is found at James 1 : 5 ?
Pray for wisdom .
On the other hand , do not procrastinate .
He likely will if he does not allow excessive secular work and recreation to sap his strength and rob him of the time he needs to take care of his ministry .
A person’s decision to dedicate his life to Jehovah or to make a marriage vow is not negotiable .
God expects us to live up to such decisions .
A wise person will from time to time review the decisions he has made .
He will not let pride or stubbornness prevent him from adjusting or even reversing a decision .
How can parents train their children to make good decisions ?
For example , the parent may allow the child to obtain a driver’s license .
Suppose the child were to break a traffic law and receive a fine .
What should we teach our Bible students , and how can we do so ?
After all , “ each of us will render an account for himself to God . ”

Later that day in prayer , the younger woman thanks Jehovah for the loving interest of the mature sister ; it was just what she needed .
In another place , a couple has recently returned from preaching in a foreign land .
At a gathering , as they excitedly relate experiences , a young brother is quietly listening .
How can we cultivate the fruitage of the spirit ?
If we want to ‘ prove ourselves sons of our Father who is in the heavens , ’ we must be different .
How , though , is it possible to love our enemies , as Jesus commanded ?
Their sincere concern for his welfare ​ — their self - sacrificing love — ​ moved them to act swiftly in his behalf , opening the way for the jailer and his entire household to become believers .
( See box on page 21 . )
( See illustration below . )
The intimate moments we spend with Jehovah in Bible reading , meditation , and prayer nourish our hearts and nurture our love for our heavenly Father .
Do you buy out as much time as possible each day to draw close to Jehovah ?
A notable characteristic of the fruitage of the spirit is its stability .
Joy , the second aspect we will consider , exemplifies this resilience .
Yet , Jehovah empowers them by means of his spirit “ to endure fully and be long - suffering with joy . ”
What is the source of our joy ?
Thus I shall bless you during my lifetime . ”
Why is it important that we serve Jehovah with joy ?
We therefore endeavor to heed the psalmist’s exhortation : “ Serve Jehovah with rejoicing .
What can we do to combat negative feelings ?
Ephesians 5 : 18 , 19 says : “ Keep getting filled with spirit , speaking to yourselves with psalms and praises to God and spiritual songs , singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah . ”
Also , the book Draw Close to Jehovah was released about that time .
His attitude toward uncircumcised Gentiles can be detected in his words : “ You well know how unlawful it is for a Jew to join himself to or approach a man of another race ; and yet God has shown me I should call no man defiled or unclean . ”
*
Yes , for just days earlier , God’s spirit had opened Peter’s heart , enabling him to begin to adjust his attitude and overcome his prejudice .
Through a vision , Jehovah made it clear to him that God’s view of people is not determined by race or nationality .
Writing to the congregation in Rome , which included both Jewish and Gentile believers , Paul stated : “ Welcome one another , just as the Christ also welcomed us , with glory to God in view . ”
Is there someone in your congregation whom you could get to know better ?
[ Footnotes ]
13 : 15 .
Jewish religious leaders held that “ the sons of your people ” and “ your fellow ” referred to Jews only .
How Would You Answer ?
But here , in a situation of life and death , everybody’s first concern is to save himself , forgetting about the others .
The weather was cold and they were standing all day long in ice - cold water .
They said Jehovah gives them the strength .
They needed their bread desperately , just like we , because they were hungry .
They collected all the bread they had , took half of it for themselves , and the other half they gave to their fellow believers who had just arrived from Dachau .
“ Your spirit is good ; may it lead me in the land of uprightness . ” ​ — PS .
No .
God’s Word speaks of Christians ’ “ walking by spirit , ” “ being led by spirit , ” and “ living by spirit . ”
On a daily basis , we should entreat Jehovah to guide our thinking , speech , and actions by means of his spirit .
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
Why is it vital that we be led by holy spirit ?
Let us consider these questions as we discuss the remaining six aspects of “ the fruitage of the spirit , ” namely , “ long - suffering , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self - control . ” ​ — Gal .
Mildness and Long - Suffering Promote Peace in the Congregation
In the congregation , mildness and long - suffering work hand in hand to promote peace .
Both of these aspects of the spirit’s fruitage help us to deal graciously with others , to remain calm under provocation , and to avoid retaliating when others say or do unkind things .
Depending on the circumstances , he might try to change the subject , defer the discussion , or excuse himself before the conversation becomes heated . ​ — Prov .
Refresh Your Family With Kindness and Goodness
It is marked by a spirit of generosity .
But goodness involves something more .
Similarly , the goodness produced by holy spirit permeates a Christian’s entire way of life .
What can be done to help family members cultivate the fruitage of the spirit ?
In a Christian household , what can help family members to treat one another with kindness and goodness ?
Some family heads include a study of the fruitage of the spirit as part of their weekly Family Worship evening .
Look for ways to apply what you learn , and pray for Jehovah to bless your efforts .
The wife comments : “ Learning that kindness includes both fidelity and loyalty has made a real difference in how we treat each other down to this day .
And it has helped us learn to say ‘ thank you ’ and ‘ I’m sorry ’ when appropriate . ”
Being kind included inviting my wife to express freely what was on her mind without my taking offense at what she said .
As we began to put kindness into practice in our marriage , our defenses gradually melted away .
Today in Satan’s world , sordid images and degraded entertainment have proliferated .
This poses a danger to our spirituality .
God’s Word counsels us : “ Put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing , badness , and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save your souls . ”
Jehovah revealed to the prophet Ezekiel that detestable things were being done in private , saying : “ Have you seen , O son of man , what the elderly ones of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness , each one in the inner rooms of his showpiece ?
Jehovah has left the land . ’ ”
Why ?
Our resolve will be like that of the psalmist who sang : “ I shall walk about in the integrity of my heart inside my house .
( b ) As depicted on page 26 , how could something similar happen today regardless of one’s age ?
It can help us to guard our heart .
But how much better if we avoid the situation in the first place !
Some find it best to use the computer or watch television only when others are present .

May we take whatever measures are necessary to protect ourselves and our family so that we can worship Jehovah “ out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
Kindness and goodness promote family happiness .
Moreover , Galatians 6 : 8 assures us : “ He who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit . ”

I Have Found Many Good Things
As told by Arthur Bonno
“ Let’s go and listen ! ”
After the meeting , application forms for Gilead School were offered .
As you might gather from the conversation that my wife and I had at that convention , I had a rather forceful personality and a can - do attitude .
In 1954 we arrived in Ecuador and have been serving as missionaries in this country ever since .
It took us two days by train and truck to travel there from the coastal city of Guayaquil ​ — a trip now accomplished in 30 minutes by airplane !
So in addition to visiting congregations , we spent many weeks during the year preaching in small Indian towns where no Witnesses were living .
Also , when I thoughtlessly spoke ill of another , she would refuse to participate in the conversation .
Mostly , though , our conversations at night revolved around points we learned from articles in The Watchtower and our field service experiences of that day .
I turned and saw that Edie was standing in black mud up to her knees .
I was able to pull her out of that mess , but her shoes remained stuck in the mud .
In time a Bible study was started , and all the members of that family were eventually baptized .
Years later , Carlos , his wife , and two of their children became special pioneers .
A letter came from Brooklyn , addressed to my wife .
A faithful sister had an unbelieving husband , who often beat her .
‘ What is going on here ? ’ I thought .
This called to mind Jesus ’ comments at John 10 : 3 , 4 , 14 about the Fine Shepherd and the sheep knowing one another very well .
Through the years , we have had the joy of welcoming hundreds of Gilead - trained missionaries , who bring maturity and zeal to the congregations they serve .
Numerous single sisters have come from abroad to pioneer here ​ — and what zealous and capable workers they are !
She also proved to be a loving daughter to her mother .
We treasure the joy we have had in helping some 70 people come to know Jehovah .

Do You Discern the Evidence of God’s Guidance ?
How awe - inspiring !
But where did it come from ?
They had to be ready to move in order to follow it .
Further , the cloud identified Moses as the one appointed by Jehovah to lead the nation .
After their deliverance through the Red Sea , they murmured against Moses , Aaron , and Jehovah because of the presumed lack of food and water .
Israel’s rebellious acts demonstrated striking disregard for Jehovah’s guidance .
78 : 40 - 42 , 52 - 54 ; Neh .

Happy is that slave , if his master on arriving finds him doing so ! ” ​ — Luke 12 : 42 , 43 .
Hence , the steward class is “ faithful , ” never betraying or abandoning Jehovah , Jesus , Bible truths , or God’s people .
Respond to God’s Guidance
A week ?
First , you may unpack only the most necessary items .
Do we try to apply it “ right afterward ” ?
By means of articles in The Watchtower and Our Kingdom Ministry , new publications , and talks at assemblies and conventions .
Do you clearly discern the evidence of divine guidance ?
Therefore , may we all keep on discerning the evidence of Jehovah’s guidance !
We are being guided by Jehovah’s organization today
Convention releases
Theocratic schooling
People lie , overcharge , steal , do not repay debts , and boast of sharp business practices .
How can we keep on resisting the tendency toward dishonesty ?
They are fear of Jehovah , a good conscience , and a sense of contentment .
Proverbs 16 : 6 states : “ In the fear of Jehovah one turns away from bad . ”
This will motivate us “ to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ” ​ — Heb .
Eight years later , João learned the truth , and his Bible - trained conscience moved him to contact his creditor and pay off that debt !
The apostle Paul wrote : “ It is a means of great gain , this godly devotion along with self - sufficiency . . . .
Having sustenance and covering , we shall be content with these things . ”
Recall the case of the man Achan .
No wonder that centuries later , Jesus warned : “ Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness ” ! ​ — Luke 12 : 15 .
Being honest at our workplace includes “ not committing theft ” ​ — even if doing so is the supposed norm .
In time , however , the agency was audited , and Jurandir was commended for his honesty .
Our brother prayed to Jehovah for courage to adhere to Bible principles .
He also tried to explain to his employer why he could not follow his instructions ​ — but to no avail .
The apostle Paul advised Christians : “ Do not you people be owing anybody a single thing . ”
He took the initiative to approach Alfredo to discuss the matter , and Alfredo agreed to be repaid in several installments .
Having sold a field , they brought only part of the proceeds to the apostles and claimed that it was the entire amount of the sale .
Similarly , Jonah did not cover up the weaknesses that he manifested before and after preaching to the Ninevites .
Instead , he recorded them . ​ — Jonah 1 : 1 - 3 ; 4 : 1 - 3 .
Although she knew that this would adversely affect her grades , Nathalia did not hesitate to tell her teacher .
It takes effort to be honest while living amid those who are ‘ lovers of themselves , lovers of money , self - assuming , haughty , and disloyal . ’
Nevertheless , a healthy fear of Jehovah , a Bible - trained conscience , and a sense of contentment help us to remain honest in a dishonest world .
• Why can we believe that the garden of Eden was a real place ?
• Did God know that Adam and Eve would sin ?
• Why did Jehovah reject King Saul ?
• How can we show that we hate lawlessness ?
We will keep alcohol in its place , avoid occult practices , and heed Jesus ’ warning about immorality .
For example , we will avoid pornography and the fantasies it might create .
Archaeologists found more than 30 beehives , which scholars estimate produced as much as half a ton of honey annually .
This indicates that beekeeping was done in the land that God had said would ‘ flow with milk and honey . ’ ​ — 3 / 1 , page 15 .
• How was Jeremiah like a tree “ planted by the waters , that sends out its roots ” ?
Martha was not taking advantage of a unique opportunity to deepen her faith . ​ — 4 / 1 , pages 12 - 13 .
The court heard no arguments for acquittal .
But I lost a lot of sleep in the first few months after she was born .
Suddenly , everything revolved around the next bottle , the next diaper change , or the next attempt to quiet the baby .
As for the new father , he may marvel at the bond formed between his wife and the baby , but he may also worry about suddenly being left out .
Love “ does not look for its own interests , does not become provoked . ”
TRY THIS : Wives , if your husband performs some child - care task in a different way than you do , resist the urge to criticize him or to redo the job .

On the other hand , a husband may fail to recognize that pregnancy has taken a toll on his wife ​ — both physically and emotionally .
Describing marriage , the Bible states : “ A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh . ”
Theresa , the mother of a two - year - old girl , says : “ If I start to feel distant from my husband , I make immediate efforts to give him my full attention , even if only for a little while each day . ”
Make a conscious effort to allay any feelings of insecurity that your wife may have .
That requires communication .
But such conversations are vital as a couple adjust to the routines of parenthood .
Fathers , whenever possible , get up at night to feed or change the baby so that your wife can rest .
A couple could find that their backgrounds cause them to argue .

Asami says : “ I felt that Katsuro was too easy on our daughter , while he felt that I was being too hard on her . ”
How should we react to potty - training setbacks ? ”
Ethan , the father of two , says : “ You need to talk things over in order to be on the same wavelength .
Decide which of their attitudes and actions you would like to imitate when raising your child .
Those sorts of changes are certainly welcome in a marriage .

When did I last make time to have a heartfelt conversation with my spouse that did not revolve around child rearing ?

In Psalm 23 , the Bible uses the metaphor of a shepherd and his sheep to illustrate the tender care that Jehovah gives his worshippers .
The writer of this psalm , David , was a shepherd as a youth .
The words between describe three ways in which Jehovah cares for his people as a shepherd cares for his sheep . ​ — Psalm 100 : 3 .
Similarly , we need help to find the right path in life .
He leads them “ in the tracks of righteousness . ”
These pastoral images reassure us that we can trust in God .
By following the leadings of his spirit as reflected in the Bible , we can pursue a way of life that brings contentment , refreshment , and security .
Jehovah tells his people that they need not fear , not even when they “ walk in the valley of deep shadow ” ​ — during what may seem to be the darkest moments in life .
Jehovah feeds his sheep .
Sheep are dependent on their shepherd to find food for them .
David felt secure knowing that if he remained close to his heavenly Shepherd , he would experience Jehovah’s loving care “ all the days of [ his ] life . ”
Do you long for such security ?

The first article discusses the responsibility that each member of the Christian family has in keeping spiritually awake .
Goals and Methods
You can find fascinating facts about many of them by consulting Insight on the Scriptures or the Watch Tower Publications Index .
Look for new ways to reason on the Scriptures .
Sophia studies with that in mind .
Learn from the way they handled situations .
Devote time to difficult scriptures and to explanations of them so that you understand them clearly .
Allow yourself plenty of time for each study session .
You will then be able to say , as did the psalmist : “ I have taken your [ Jehovah’s ] reminders as a possession to time indefinite , for they are the exultation of my heart . ” ​ — Ps .
Be reasonable in the amount of time you schedule for personal study .
Babies do not have to cultivate a longing for milk .
But the Scriptures acknowledge that we do have to form a longing for God’s word .
What may at first have seemed difficult will soon become pleasurable .
Soon you will acquire a string of spiritual pearls of wisdom ​ — a delightful possession . ​ — Ps .
19 : 14 ; Prov .
Sophia is working on remembering and using a variety of scriptures to capture the attention of householders and make her Christian ministry effective and exciting .
The most outstanding benefit of taking delight in God’s Word , though , is a close relationship with Jehovah .

“ Let us stay awake and keep our senses . ” ​ — 1 THESS .
5 : 6 .
REFERRING to “ the great and fear - inspiring day of Jehovah , ” the apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Thessalonica : “ Brothers , you are not in darkness , so that that day should overtake you as it would thieves , for you are all sons of light and sons of day .
( Read John 10 : 14 , 15 . )
What is the key to success for a man who wants to build up his household spiritually ?
He knows their individual needs , their weaknesses , and their strengths .
Nothing about his sheep escapes the notice of our Exemplar .
How can husbands imitate the Fine Shepherd ?
To exercise his headship in imitation of Christ , a husband must learn to think of himself as a shepherd and of those under his care as sheep .
He even ‘ surrendered his soul in behalf of the sheep . ’
However , he must not fail to show affection for his children .
Their families enjoy the type of spiritual security that the psalmist sang about . ​ — Read Psalm 23 : 1 - 6 .
Christian family heads are in a similar position in these last days .
Prior to creating the first woman , Eve , the true God declared : “ It is not good for the man to continue by himself . I am going to make a helper for him , as a complement of him . ”
An exemplary wife works for the good of her household .
What can a wife do to help her family to “ stay awake ” ?
Moreover , she is supportive of her husband when he gives counsel and discipline to their children .
How different she is from an uncooperative wife , whose children suffer physically and spiritually !
Being exemplary in a supportive role may be a challenge for a wife when her husband makes a decision she disagrees with .
Consider the prize that Jehovah has set before you .
As you grew older , they likely used the Bible and Christian publications to help you visualize what everlasting life would be like in the new world .
What can youths do to run the race for life successfully ?
Because “ the things unseen are everlasting . ” ​ — 2 Cor .
Plan to live your life in such a way as to attain them .
How can a young person determine if he has made the truth his own ?
Do I make an effort to maintain a consistent routine of sharing in activities related to true worship , such as regular prayer , study , meeting attendance , and field service ?
6 : 19 .
In the race for life , who receive the prize ?
Many have run successfully before you , and many are running alongside you .
The prize will go to all those who do not give up .
It is vital for all in the family to shoulder their Scriptural responsibility .
See The Watchtower , November 15 , 2010 , pages 12 - 16 ; July 15 , 2004 , pages 21 - 23 .
“ Keep ready , because at an hour that you do not think likely the Son of man is coming . ” ​ — LUKE 12 : 40 .
1 , 2 .
Let us consider other ways that we can contribute to the spiritual well - being of our family .
Since materialism is a snare that has entrapped not a few families , consider what Jesus said about keeping our eye “ simple . ”
1 : 18 .
This means that we remain content with our material provisions and give God’s service the first place in our life . ​ — Heb .
What good results there can be when children are trained to keep a simple eye !
Why , they rejoiced with her and told her how proud they were of her !
“ Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness [ or , “ covetousness ” ] not even be mentioned among you , ” states the Bible . ​ — Eph . 5 : 3 ; ftn .
Hence , we are wise to heed Jesus ’ advice : “ Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness . ”
Exercise restraint .
The comments given by family members can help the head of the household to discern the degree of their spirituality .
Why not consider some goals that you and your family can pursue ?
As a family head , identify areas in which your family could grow spiritually .
Then set specific goals to achieve that aim .
A family that pursues spiritual goals will make its advancement “ manifest to all persons . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
Now that some time has elapsed since that change was introduced , we can ask ourselves : ‘ Am I using the time made available to have a Family Worship evening or to engage in personal study ?
The closer we draw to Jehovah , the greater our motivation is to love him ‘ with our whole heart , our whole soul , our whole mind , and our whole strength . ’
How are you benefiting from an evening set aside for family worship or personal study ?
Moreover , the study material should be selected in such a way that the sessions are practical for your family .
“ Stay Awake ” and “ Keep Ready ”
Are you achieving the intended objectives ?
83 : 18 .
PERHAPS the first time you saw Jehovah’s name was when it was shown to you at Psalm 83 : 18 .
Notice how the psalmist highlights yet another truth essential to our salvation when he says : “ You alone are the Most High over all the earth . ”
But how was Satan able to deceive Eve ?
Satan used several subtle tactics in his conversation with Eve .
The Issue in Job’s Day
How did Satan challenge Job’s record of integrity , and what opportunity was thereby given to Job ?
Centuries later , the faithful man Job had an opportunity to show who was the most important Person in his life .
( Read Job 2 : 9 , 10 . )
( b ) What was Jesus ’ reaction to this temptation ?
Shortly after Jesus ’ baptism , Satan tried to entice Jesus to pursue selfish desires rather than to keep Jehovah as the most important Person in his life .
Obviously , the Devil wanted Jesus to be overly concerned about his own reputation , even to the point of making a showy display .
Satan knew that a person might accept a dangerous dare because of pride and a desire not to lose face in front of others .
By rejecting that dare , Jesus again proved that Jehovah was the most important Person in his life .
As Jesus neared the end of his earthly course , he was confronted with a very difficult decision .
What lessons have we learned so far from the examples of Eve , Job , and Jesus Christ ?
How did Jesus ’ reaction to temptation differ from that of Eve , and how can we imitate Jesus ?
( Comment on illustration on page 18 . )
Never allow temptations to make you forget Jehovah .
She saw that the fruit “ was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes , yes , the tree was desirable to look upon . ”
We must recall what his Word , the Bible , says .
Even so , like Job , we may find that our hearts are weighed down when we lose loved ones or suffer personal difficulties .
Job did not understand why Jehovah allowed certain things to happen , and at times we may not understand why bad things happen .
Or we may know of an integrity keeper who has become a victim of an act of violence or has died in a terrible accident .
Many calamities are the result of “ time and unforeseen occurrence . ”
He will give us the strength required to continue on faithfully . ​ — 2 Cor .
By so doing , Jesus put Jehovah’s will first , and this resulted in his being exalted to a superior position .
No wonder , then , that we are surrounded by a me - first generation .
Rather , whether we are faced with temptation , beset by tragedies , or confronted with efforts to shame us , let each one of us be determined to prove that Jehovah is indeed the most important Person in our life !
[ Footnote ]
Some Bible scholars feel that the expression “ skin in behalf of skin ” may imply that Job would selfishly be willing to allow his children and animals to lose their skins , or lives , as long as he could keep his own skin , or life .
• the main focus of Jesus ’ attention ?
During times of distress , we can focus on “ the God of all comfort ”
4 : 9 .
Why is knowing Jehovah and being known by him such a great privilege ?
Why is knowing Jehovah and becoming known by him such a great privilege ?
The prophet Nahum was inspired to write : “ Jehovah is good , a stronghold in the day of distress .
And he is cognizant of those seeking refuge in him . ”
In fact , our very prospects for eternal life are dependent on our coming to know the true God and his Son , Jesus Christ . ​ — John 17 : 3 .
What is involved in coming to know God ?
4 , 5 . ( a ) As used in the Bible , what does the word “ purpose ” refer to ?
( b ) Illustrate how a purpose can be achieved in more than one way .
Jehovah is a God of purpose , and the Bible speaks of his “ eternal purpose . ”
As used in the Bible , the word “ purpose ” refers to a specific goal , or aim , that can be achieved in more than one way .
To illustrate : A person may desire to travel to a specific destination .
Yet , no matter what adjustments he needs to make , he will still have accomplished his goal when he arrives at his destination .
How has Jehovah shown flexibility in fulfilling his purpose ?
Absolutely not !
What do we learn from Jehovah’s description of himself as recorded at Exodus 3 : 14 ?
And he added : ‘ This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel , “ I shall prove to be has sent me to you . ” ’ ” Yes , Jehovah is able to become whatever he needs to become in order to accomplish his purpose fully !
An examination of this illustration will enhance our appreciation for the depth of Jehovah’s wisdom , whether our hope is to go to heaven or to gain everlasting life here on earth .
11 , 12 . ( a ) When did the selection begin of those who would form the heavenly Kingdom , and what was the reaction of the majority of Jews living at that time ?
As a nation , the first - century Jews rejected Jesus .
The Symbolic Olive Tree
The apostle Paul goes on to compare those who become part of Abraham’s seed to branches on a symbolic olive tree .
Originally , they were like wild olive branches , not having any opportunity to be a part of this special covenant .
But Jehovah opened the way for them to become spiritual Jews . ​ — Rom .
How was this so ?
* In a similar way , Jehovah did something extraordinary .
“ All Israel Will Be Saved ”
19 , 20 .
In Jehovah’s due time , “ all Israel ” ​ — that is , the complete number of spiritual Israelites — ​ will serve as kings and priests in heaven .
Truly , as we contemplate the outworking of Jehovah’s eternal purpose , we cannot help but be amazed at “ the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge . ” ​ — Rom .
It is used especially of things that fulfill the purpose for which they were made .
Grafting Wild Olive Branches ​ — Why ?
[ Picture on page 23 ]
Jesus ’ leadership is refreshing and uplifting .
How important is it for us to follow Jesus ’ footsteps ?
Doing so includes listening to and obeying him and cooperating with those who represent him .
Hear and Obey
Cooperate With Christ’s Representatives
In fact , Jesus spoke of his anointed representatives as his “ brothers . ”
By studying the Scriptures and attending congregation meetings , we are reminded of the sayings of Christ .
Another way to cooperate with Christ’s “ brothers ” is to have a positive attitude toward any refinements in our understanding of Scriptural truths as published by “ the faithful and discreet slave . ” ​ — Matt .
The world is sadly lacking in effective leadership .
Both of these compositions express the conviction that God hears and answers prayers .
Wondering how Absalom has been able to marshal such support , David asks : “ O Jehovah , why have my adversaries become many ?
Many are saying of my soul : ‘ There is no salvation for him by God . ’ ”
Many Israelites think that Jehovah will not deliver David from calamity at the hands of Absalom and his cohorts .
David calls out with confidence that God will answer him .
Fittingly , then , David refers to having his prayer answered from Jehovah’s holy mountain .
So can we if we adhere to “ the ways of Jehovah ” and never depart from him . ​ — Read 2 Samuel 22 : 21 , 22 .
Despite the words of Psalm 3 : 6 , 7 , why would you say that David did not have a vindictive spirit ?
For you will have to strike all my enemies on the jaw . The teeth of wicked ones you will have to break . ” ​ — Ps .
Your blessing is upon your people . ”
( Read Proverbs 3 : 31 - 35 . )
Why may David have become discouraged ?
At times , we may face a discouraging situation that robs us of confidence .
Temporarily , this may have been true of David , for he sings : “ You sons of men , how long must my glory be for insult , while you keep loving empty things , while you keep seeking to find a lie ? ”
David’s enemies ‘ loved empty things . ’
Even if we become discouraged because of what others do , let us continue to pray earnestly and manifest complete trust in the only true God .
We can have our say in our heart while in bed .
David concludes this psalm with the words : “ In peace I will both lie down and sleep , for you yourself alone , O Jehovah , make me dwell in security . ”
When the Israelites kept Jehovah’s Law , they were at peace with him and felt secure .
For instance , ‘ Judah and Israel dwelt in security ’ during Solomon’s reign .
What joy that brings us !
“ A Wonderful Overseer and a Dear Friend ”
He was 97 years of age .
Brother Barr often spoke with affection about his early family life ; he was grateful for the sterling example that his beloved father and mother set for him .
As he entered his teenage years , young Jack began to find it extremely difficult to speak to strangers .
However , he worked hard to overcome the problem , and on one Sunday afternoon in 1927 , at the age of 14 , he announced to his father that he was ready to accompany him in the door - to - door preaching activity .
That was the beginning .
Then in 1939 , he became a member of the Bethel family in London , England .
For those who knew him , the name Jack Barr will bring to mind a man who gave thoughtful advice ​ — always balanced , always kind , and rooted in Scripture .

Theories of Prosperity for All
Could the earth’s resources be distributed more evenly ?
The objective that citizens would work for the benefit of the community rather than for themselves proved elusive .
Could the nations that are prosperous be encouraged to help those that are still poor ?
After World War II , Europe was devastated and many of its people felt threatened by starvation .
This European Recovery Program , known as the Marshall Plan , was considered a success .
Sixty years later , after spending many times the amount spent on the Marshall Plan , the results were disappointing .
The economy just needed repairing .
Also , when rich countries dump surplus food on poor countries as “ aid , ” local farmers and retailers go out of business , leading to more poverty .
The Cause of Poverty
Extreme poverty is the result when nations , governments , and individuals act only to promote and protect self - interest .
No family would sink into generations of poverty .
If he had not repurchased himself by the seventh year , he was to be set free and provided with seed and livestock in order for him to start farming again .
Israel did not obey Jehovah’s Law .
Almighty God can provide what is needed to end poverty .
Where can such an ideal ruler be found ?
When Jesus stood up to read the commission he received from God , he said : “ Jehovah’s spirit is upon me , because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor . ” ​ — Luke 4 : 16 - 18 .
God has appointed Jesus as King .
He declared : “ All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth . ” ​ — Matthew 28 : 18 .
For example , consider Jesus ’ answer to a man who wanted to know how to please God .
asked Jesus .
People who become Jehovah’s Witnesses study such teachings of Jesus and change their attitude about helping those in need .
Such experiences demonstrate that Jesus ’ example and teachings really do have the power to change people’s attitude toward helping those in need .
Even the apostle Paul wrote : “ I find , then , this law in my case : that when I wish to do what is right , what is bad is present with me . ”
Some time after Jesus ’ baptism , John the Baptizer introduced Jesus , saying : “ See , the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world ! ”
God’s Word says : “ They will actually sit , each one under his vine and under his fig tree , and there will be no one making them tremble . ”
Those words poetically describe the time when all will have satisfying work , security , and full opportunity to enjoy a world without poverty , to Jehovah’s praise .
IMAGINE that you have a bag with a hole in it , and you have the task of keeping the bag inflated .
How would you do it ?
The Bible is a source of much helpful information in this regard .
Each envelope represents a category of expense , such as “ Food , ” “ Rent , ” or “ Clothing . ”
The Bible warns : “ He chases after wealth , the man of greedy eye , not knowing that want is overtaking him . ” ​ — Proverbs 28 : 22 , The Jerusalem Bible .
Jesus advised his followers to keep their eye “ simple . ”
Setting your eyes on lobster and fine wine when all you can afford is dried fish and water can easily lead to financial ruin .
“ I have a list of where I spend my money . ”
Danilo follows the same principle .
He and his wife experienced the failure of their small business .
Myrna has made an effort to help her children learn the value of living a simple life .
He says : “ During our family Bible study , we discuss experiences of Christians who keep their attention focused on what really matters , spiritual things .
“ Instead of going to malls , I seek out stores that offer better deals .
Diosdado agrees : “ To control myself , I usually leave my credit card at the office . ”
By applying the Bible principles discussed in this article and by learning from others who have benefited from following these principles , you too can live within your means .
Can you imagine the joy of Martha and Mary when Jesus raised Lazarus back to life ? ​ — Read John 11 : 20 - 24 , 38 - 44 .
What is the condition of the dead ?
Clearly , the dead cannot suffer .
Who will come back to life ?
Even some who practiced bad things because they did not know Jehovah will be resurrected . ​ — Read Luke 23 : 43 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
Resurrected ones will be able to learn the truth about God and to exercise faith in Jesus by obeying him .
Those who come back to life and do good things will be able to enjoy life forever on earth .
However , some resurrected ones will continue doing bad things .
The resurrection is possible because God sent his Son to give his life for us .

Accordingly , what Biblical guidance can help parents determine whether their children are ready for baptism ?
Instead of specifying an age to get baptized , God’s Word describes the spiritual condition of those qualified to take that step .

I am glad that he has helped me to continue in his service . ”
The apostle Paul wrote : “ With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness , but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation . ”
Some parents consider their children’s baptism as a beneficial step that involves risk ​ — much like getting a driver’s license .
The Bible answers no .
And Paul wrote to young Timothy : “ To be sure , it is a means of great gain , this godly devotion along with self - sufficiency . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
Jeremiah knew that God’s service was the source of his joy .
What may be their reasons ?
Is it reasonable to believe that a young person who puts off baptism will not be accountable to God for his conduct ?
Do not forget , Jehovah protects his servants by ‘ not letting them be tempted beyond what they can bear . ’
Commenting on youths who qualify for baptism but whose parents do not agree , an experienced elder said : “ Preventing a young one from getting baptized can break his spiritual momentum and lead to discouragement . ”

Personal prayer
‘ I AM happy to share the good news each day . ’
You may be able to recite from memory Jesus ’ prophecy about our doing that . ​ — Matt .
24 : 14 .
You probably also highlight that God’s Kingdom will reestablish Paradise on earth so that peace and happiness can flourish .
In fact , the “ good news of the kingdom ” is part of “ the good news [ declared ] beforehand to Abraham , namely : ‘ By means of you all the nations will be blessed . ’ ” ​ — Gal .
Why can we say that the apostle Paul emphasized good news in the book of Romans ?
15 : 16 ; 1 Thess .
2 : 2 .
“ Some began to believe the things said ; others would not believe . ”
Clearly , Paul gave attention to God’s Kingdom .
Something that is central to the Kingdom ​ — Jesus ’ role in God’s purpose .
All people need to know about Jesus and put faith in him .
And he related : “ From Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ . ”
6 , 7 .
Whatever the case , by the time Paul wrote the book , about 56 C.E . , the congregation was long established .
Every Christian in Rome faced a predicament that also confronts each one of us .
Paul put it this way : “ All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ”
Paul called attention to what possible result of the good news ?
Yes , salvation was possible .
Before a person can develop lifesaving faith , he must acknowledge that he is a sinner .
( Read Ecclesiastes 7 : 20 . )
Still , given his background , he does not really understand why he and others are like that .
Obviously , a person growing up in such an environment may not readily think of himself as a sinner in the sense that Paul meant .
Why do many not believe that all are sinners ?
Even if they go to church on occasion , they consider the Bible account of Adam and Eve to be merely a fable or a myth .
2 : 12 .
This accords with an observation Paul made when writing from Rome to the Hebrews : “ Every house is constructed by someone , but he that constructed all things is God . ”
Referring to such reasoning , Paul rightly concluded that “ Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin . ” ​ — Rom .
Continuing his reasoning , he points out that people of nations or ethnic groups unacquainted with that divine code often “ do by nature the things of the law . ”
The case of ancient Israel shows that .
Though the Israelites had both a God - given conscience and specific laws from God against stealing and adultery , they often violated both their conscience and Jehovah’s Law .
This seriously marred their relationship with their Maker . ​ — Lev .
We should definitely bear in mind this aspect of the good news as we carry out our Christian ministry .
The basic message about Jesus may not be strange to those who are acquainted with what the Bible says about sin .
As such ones come to believe in God and trust in the Scriptures , we will need to explain Jesus ’ role .
• The book of Romans highlights what aspect of the good news ?
• How can “ the good news about the Christ ” mean blessings for us and others ?
The good news highlighted in Romans involved Jesus ’ vital role in God’s purpose
We were all born with a fatal flaw ​ — sin !
5 : 21 .
This gift is a divine means to have an approved and righteous standing with God and the prospect of salvation and everlasting life .
Jehovah created two humans , Adam and Eve .
The Creator is perfect , and so were those first humans , our ancestors .
Thus , sin and death ruled down to the time when God gave the Israelites a law code , which clearly showed that they were sinners .
You may have read that Alexis , son of Russian Czar Nicholas II and Alexandra , inherited the bleeding disorder hemophilia .
Granted , even in such a family , some children do not suffer from those diseases , but they still may be carriers .
Could that predicament ever be overcome ?
How did the course of two perfect men lead to different results ?
Lovingly , Jehovah made a provision for humans to overcome inherited sinfulness .
It speaks of a change in a person’s status in relation to God , not of an inner change in the person . . .
He kept his integrity even to the extent of dying on a torture stake .
20 : 28 ; Rom .
Why do those who are declared righteous need God’s mercy and love ?
Still , Jesus ’ disciples on earth , including his faithful apostles , remained imperfect .
Why ?
Because they had inherited sin .
“ Those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness [ will ] rule as kings in life through the one person , Jesus Christ . ”
Paul discussed a prime example , Abraham , a man of faith who lived before Jehovah provided a law code to Israel and long before Christ opened the way to heavenly life .
That cannot mean that Abraham was sinless while serving Jehovah over the decades .
However , in his limitless wisdom , Jehovah took into account Abraham’s exceptional faith and his works resulting therefrom .
What , then , about true Christians who hope to live in the restored earthly Paradise ?
Nevertheless , they exercise deep faith in God and his provisions , and they manifest their faith by good works .
Rather , it reflects the wise purpose of the Universal Sovereign .
[ Footnote ]
The book Civilizations of the Ancient Near East states : “ Recent research has suggested that the domestication of the camel took place in southeastern Arabia some time in the third millennium [ B.C.E . ] .
Written evidence also exists .
By the middle of the first century C.E . when Paul wrote these words , the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures had been divided into either 22 or 24 books , most of which were likely in separate scrolls .

So it is understandable that Paul would have obtained personal copies of the scrolls of God’s Word . ​ — Acts 5 : 34 ; 22 : 3 .
How , then , did most of the Christians in those days gain access to the Word of God ?
Surely , during the public reading of the Word of God , all listened attentively so as not to miss a word , and parents and children must have discussed at home what was read at the meetings .
Just before making his request , Paul , imprisoned in Rome for a second time , wrote : “ I have fought the fine fight , I have run the course to the finish . . .
He likely wrote these words about 65 C.E . during the persecution by Nero .
Though he was confident that he had fought the fine fight to the finish , he longed to continue strengthening himself by studying the Word of God .
What can we learn from Paul’s request for “ the scrolls , especially the parchments ” ?
4 : 16 .
( For fully formatted text , see publication )
Rome
To stand firm against him , they needed to ‘ keep their senses ’ and to ‘ humble themselves under the mighty hand of God . ’
Thereafter , we will reflect on the proper way of carrying out the shepherding work .
6 : 12 .
4 , 5 .
Peter encouraged the older men among the first - century Christians to have a godly view of the flock entrusted to them .
It was most important for them to recognize that the flock belongs to Jehovah and Jesus Christ .
If one child got sick , would you not make sure that he received any needed medical help ?
With regard to each one , David said that he “ grabbed hold of its beard and struck it down and put it to death . ”
How close he must have come to the beast’s jaws !
Today , elders need to be on guard against the lionlike attacks of the Devil .
They may reason with unwary brothers who are tempted by Satan’s snares .
( Read Jude 22 , 23 . )
Instead of intimidating their brother , the elders tenderly explain Scriptural principles and show him how he can apply these in his life .
One who spends little time listening to you and then quickly prescribes medication so as to be free to see the next patient ?
Or would you rather consult a doctor who hears you out , explains what might be wrong with you , and outlines possible treatments ?
Likewise , the elders can listen to the spiritually sick person and help to heal the wound , thus figuratively “ greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah . ”
To what extent did the apostle Paul give of himself ?
To what extent should the elders give of themselves ?
In caring for the sheep , they imitate the apostle Paul , even as he imitated Jesus .
She would do anything for them , including getting up in the middle of the night to feed them .
As we have discussed , the elders should keep in mind that the flock they are shepherding is God’s , not their own .
At times , Jesus ’ apostles reached out with the wrong motive .
Like those who were ruling the nations , they wanted to have a prominent position . ​ — Read Mark 10 : 42 - 45 .
If the apostles had difficulty in this area , then elders can appreciate that they need to work hard to avoid any worldly tendency to enjoy having authority over others .
They appreciate that rather than harsh criticism , gentle persuasion is usually more effective in reaching hearts and in moving someone to follow a right course .
Christ’s fine example motivates elders to love the flock .
The next article will discuss ways in which congregation members can support those appointed to take the lead .
• Why was it appropriate for Peter to admonish fellow elders to shepherd the flock of God in their care ?
• What moves elders to shepherd the flock of God in their care ?
“ Have Regard for Those Who Are Working Hard Among You ”
“ Have regard for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you . ” ​ — 1 THESS .
5 : 12 .
He may have appointed older men to take the lead , as was the case in other congregations .
So he sent Timothy to encourage the congregation .
After all , the Bible says that the Beroeans were “ more noble - minded than those in Thessalonica , . . . carefully examining the Scriptures daily . ”
The older men must have worked hard to feed such ones spiritually .
Today , the faithful and discreet slave class is providing God’s flock with “ food at the proper time . ”
6 , 7 . ( a ) What example did the older men in Thessalonica have in Paul ?
When shepherding , the older men were to be like him .
As Paul wrote , ‘ they are keeping watch over our souls . ’
Likewise , the elders today may sacrifice some sleep while tending to the needs of those who have poor health or emotional or spiritual problems .
Consider the relief effort after Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in 2008 .
For example , the coordinator of the body of elders prepares the schedules for weekly meetings .
The elders read letters from the branch office and apply the direction that helps maintain “ the oneness in the faith . ”
Through the efforts of such hardworking elders , “ all things take place decently and by arrangement . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
The word in the original language implies “ standing before ” and can be rendered “ directing ; taking the lead among . ”
Paul referred to the same elders as “ working hard . ”
“ Presiding over ” the congregation involves more than just teaching .
Why might it take time to reach a decision at an elders ’ meeting ?
Their goal is to apply Scriptural principles to the needs of the local congregation .
Do you appreciate that the body of elders work together in unity ?
What might happen if one elder insists on having his way or tries to promote his own ideas ?
If Satan tried to upset the first - century congregation , we can be sure that he wants to disrupt the peace of the congregation today .
In the Christian Greek Scriptures , only Paul used the Greek term translated “ admonish . ”
Elders do well to keep what in mind when admonishing others ?
They strive to imitate Paul by being kind , loving , and helpful .
Of course , the elders ‘ hold firmly to the faithful word so that they may be able to exhort by teaching that is healthful . ’ ​ — Titus 1 : 5 - 9 .
What should you keep in mind if you receive admonition from an elder ?
Of course , elders are imperfect and may say things that they later regret .
If you have been admonished , do you appreciate that elder’s loving concern ?
Likewise , do not allow the way you are admonished to prevent you from listening to those whom Jehovah and Jesus may be using to let you know how you can help or protect yourself spiritually .
How may you show appreciation for the “ gifts in men ” ?
The “ gifts in men ” are what Jehovah through Jesus Christ has provided for you .
You can also show your appreciation by making meaningful comments at meetings .
Some have climbed the corporate ladder and have achieved great success in getting rich and making a name for themselves .
Extracurricular Activities and Hobbies
Some young Christians , though , become heavily involved in extracurricular activities and hobbies .
In time , I won many prizes and awards .
“ The sport robbed me of my energy , and soon I realized that it was also robbing me of my spiritual zeal .
It would be good to consider what effect pursuing higher education could have on one’s relationship with Jehovah .
Baruch was the secretary to the prophet Jeremiah .
At one point , rather than focusing on the privileges he had in serving Jehovah , Baruch became ambitious .
In any case , he had lost sight of the more important things , those having spiritual value .
The counsel Baruch received indicates that something was amiss .
Consider Grzegorz , a computer programmer .
Engrossed in One’s Employment
If a Christian became engrossed in his secular work , spiritual pursuits could easily be pushed into second place .
Becoming absorbed in a secular job can rob a Christian of the energy needed to maintain his own spiritual balance and to assist his family .
Soon I stopped attending meetings .
We have considered three areas in which a Christian might become very involved at the cost of his spirituality .
Do you find association with your fellow believers to be less appealing ?
“ That shook me up , ” says Wiktor .
Why not indicate to the elders in your congregation that you would like to reach out for more privileges in serving God ?
“ Fear the true God and keep his commandments , ” and you will receive Jehovah’s rich blessing and ‘ see good because of your hard work . ’ ​ — Eccl .
With no income and deeply in debt , he turned to Jehovah .
He says : “ When I am satisfied with the basics and at the same time give of myself spiritually , I have peace of mind and a calm heart . ” ​ — Phil .
Some names have been changed .
▪ How much time do these demand ?
▪ Are these consuming time you previously devoted to spiritual pursuits ?
▪ What about associations ?
HIGHER EDUCATION
Jehovah warned Baruch about ambition
Some ancient philosophers said no .
Did they live up to their end of the agreement ? ​ — Exodus 19 : 3 - 8 .
Another translation says that they would “ give him cause for grief . ”

The Bible Changes Lives
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : BENIN
The villagers fish and raise cattle , goats , sheep , pigs , and birds .
When I was a child , my father sent my sister and me to a fetish convent , where we were initiated into that traditional belief .
These sacrifices were costly , often consuming nearly all my resources .
I also learned that he does not approve of the use of idols in worship .
My friends , relatives , and neighbors opposed me and made fun of me .
There I experienced Christian love , and I was impressed because these people try to live by the Bible’s high moral standards .
What I saw convinced me that Jehovah’s Witnesses practice the true religion .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : Applying Bible principles has helped me improve my relationship with my children .
I used to exhaust my resources on lifeless idols that did not benefit me in any way .
“ I Had Been Looking for God Since Childhood . ” ​ — SHINJI SATO
My parents were very religious ; they raised me from childhood to revere the Shinto gods .
My classmates had very concrete hopes , such as becoming a scientist .
One day he asked me , “ Sato , do you know what this book is ? ”
But I did not make time to read it , as school life kept me very busy .
I soon discovered , however , that being a Shinto priest was not what I had expected it to be .
Talking about faith is forbidden . ”
At those meetings , I learned that God expects husbands to show love and honor to their family members .
At first , I worried about what others would think if I left the Shinto religion .
So in the spring of 1989 , I decided to follow my conscience .
First , I searched thoroughly for anything in my home that was related to my former religion .
“ I Knew That Something Was Missing . ” ​ — LYNETTE HOUGHTING
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : SOUTH AFRICA
Even so , I was quite active physically .
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE : When I started studying the Bible , I learned that Jehovah is a God of love .
I also learned that he has demonstrated that love by giving us his Word , the Bible .
One change I needed to make was in my associations .
As I gradually overcame that hurdle , I faced another challenge .
That was a real blow to my self - worth , and it took me nearly ten years to shed the excess weight .

God’s Son is the ideal King because he is kind , firm for what is right , and powerful enough to help people .
Like Jesus , they are resurrected with a spiritual body . ​ — Read John 14 : 1 - 3 ; 1 Corinthians 15 : 42 - 45 .
How many people go to heaven ?
* Shortly afterward , he threw Satan and his demons down to the earth .
By means of a global preaching work , God’s Kingdom is already helping millions from all nations to learn God’s ways .
Finally , Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father .
For more information , see chapters 8 and 9 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Yet , he ran on tirelessly , for “ the very hand of Jehovah ” was upon him .
Why , he had just outpaced the team of horses that was pulling King Ahab in his royal chariot ! ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 46 .
* ​ — 1 Kings 18 : 18 - 45 .
When things seem to be going our way , it is only natural that our hopes rise .
If Elijah thought that way , no wonder , for he “ was a man with feelings like ours . ”
Notice that Ahab’s account of the day’s events left out Elijah’s God , Jehovah .
Clearly , he had not learned to respect Jehovah God .
And how did the vengeful Jezebel react ?
She was furious !
Livid with rage , she sent this message to Elijah : “ So may the gods do , and so may they add to it , if at this time tomorrow I shall not make your soul like the soul of each one of them ! ”
This was a death threat of the worst kind .
How was he affected ?
Did Elijah picture in his mind’s eye the terrible death that Jezebel had in store for him ?
Driven by fear , Elijah fled southwestward some 95 miles ( 150 km ) to Beer - sheba , a town near the southern border of Judah .
The record says that he went “ a day’s journey , ” so we may picture him starting off at sunrise , evidently carrying no provisions with him .
Elijah prayed in utter desperation .
He knew that his forefathers were then mere dust and bones in the grave , unable to do any good for anybody .
Why go on living ?
After Elijah sank into sleep , Jehovah sent an angel to him .
That one meal did not make all his problems go away , but it sustained him in a miraculous way .
Taking in such spiritual nourishment may not make all our problems go away , but it can help us endure what might otherwise be unendurable .
The question was likely spoken in a gentle way , for Elijah took it as an invitation to pour out his feelings .
Elijah’s words reveal at least three reasons for his low spirits .
It may not have been easy for Elijah to admit to those feelings , but he did not let pride or embarrassment hold him back .
Remember his fear .
It invited Elijah to express himself again , and he did so , pouring out his concerns a second time .
* Perhaps that brought him further relief .
This younger man would become Elijah’s companion and helper for a number of years .
Soon he was back in action , once more the bold , faithful prophet who stood up against the wickedness of false worship .
In verse 15 , this spirit is referred to simply as “ Jehovah . ”

Will You Follow Jehovah’s Loving Guidance ?
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE
Introducing the Simplified English Edition
It will contain the study articles and , as space allows , selected secondary articles .
Why so ?
English is the common language spoken by our brothers in such lands as Fiji , Ghana , Kenya , Liberia , Nigeria , Papua New Guinea , and Solomon Islands .
Although our brothers in these countries may speak other local , or indigenous , languages , they often use English for everyday communication at congregation meetings and in the field ministry .
Also , there are others of Jehovah’s people who have moved to countries where they must use English to communicate even though their knowledge of the language is quite limited .
Thus , all can follow along in either edition and participate at the Watchtower Study .
To show the difference in wording in the two editions , see the example below from paragraph 2 of the first study article in this issue .
24 : 45 . Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses
IT BEGAN in 1995 and lasted for 15 years .
During all that time , true Christians in Russia were under attack by opposers of freedom of religion .
These opposers were determined to have Jehovah’s Witnesses outlawed in Moscow and beyond .
In 1993 , Moscow’s Department of Justice registered the Moscow Community of Jehovah’s Witnesses , as we are legally known there .
The first stage of the struggle began in June 1995 .
The group claimed to be acting on behalf of family members who resented that their spouses or children had become Witnesses .
Again , Jehovah’s Witnesses in Moscow were investigated , but the prosecutor came to the same conclusion ​ — there were no grounds for starting a criminal case .
Although the representative of the prosecutor’s office that conducted this fifth investigation admitted that there was no evidence of criminal activity , she still advised that a civil suit be brought against our brothers .
The prosecutor of the Northern Administrative Circuit of Moscow agreed and filed a civil complaint .
The lawyer showed publications of the Russian Orthodox Church that severely criticize Jehovah’s Witnesses and asked : “ Do these statements violate the law ? ”
The prosecution presented a professor of psychiatry as an expert witness .
On March 12 , 1999 , the judge appointed five academics to study the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and she suspended the trial .
This panel commissioned by the Ministry reported on April 15 , 1999 , that they had found nothing harmful in our publications .
Three months later , on May 30 , 2001 , that court annulled the decision of Judge Prokhorycheva .
* Prosecutor Kondratyeva rehashed the charge that Jehovah’s Witnesses promote hatred , but then she added that banning the legal community of Jehovah’s Witnesses was a means to protect the rights of the Witnesses in Moscow !
The prosecutor stated that there was no need for her to provide evidence to prove that the Witnesses were guilty of wrongdoing .
Of course , that announcement confirmed that members of the clergy were indeed deeply involved in the drive to ban the Witnesses .
Other scholars agreed .
On June 16 , 2004 , the Moscow City Court upheld the decision .
Similarly , our brothers in Moscow did not let opposers sidetrack them from the work that is to be carried out today ​ — the preaching of the good news .
Meanwhile , the Russian Orthodox clergy showed their true colors .
An enraged man chased a sister out of a building and kicked her so violently in the spine that she fell and hit her head .
She required medical help ; yet , the police took no action against her attacker .
Before long , numerous congregations lost their rented meeting places .
It also stated that Russia had a legal obligation to “ put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress as far as possible the effects . ” ​ — See the box “ The Court’s Judgment , ” on page 8 .
The attention focused on the Witnesses by the investigations , the court cases , and the verdict of an international court has indeed been “ for a witness ” and has contributed to “ the advancement of the good news . ”
[ Footnotes ]
[ Box / ​ Picture on page 6 ]
Individuals or organizations who are victims of violations of the treaty and who have exhausted all domestic legal avenues can bring their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , France ( shown above ) .
It is made up of 47 judges ​ — a number equal to the number of countries that signed the European Convention on Human Rights .
The Court decided otherwise .
It stated :
“ It is the resistance and unwillingness of non - religious family members to accept and to respect their religious relative’s freedom to manifest and practise his or her religion that is the source of conflict . ” ​ — Par . 111 .
Another charge stated that by not accepting blood transfusions , Jehovah’s Witnesses damage the health of believers . The Court ruled to the contrary , stating :
Will You Follow Jehovah’s Loving Guidance ?
For guidance , you turn to a trusted friend who knows the way .
30 : 21 .
Let us keep in mind that Jehovah gives such warnings out of concern and love .
The third is not even real ; nonetheless , it is very dangerous .
( b ) What important principle do we find at Exodus 23 : 2 ?
How were Joshua and Caleb pressured to follow the crowd , but what enabled them to resist ?
But even the most baseless ideas can exert power over those weak in faith .
13 : 25 - 33 .
No doubt , a good part of it came from their faith .
14 : 1 - 10 .
( b ) Why do you find the example of many Christian youths heartwarming ?
Christian youths in school may face strong pressure from the crowd to see and do what everyone else is seeing and doing .
Obeying such a law helped God’s people to keep themselves distinct and separate from the pagan nations around them .
How so ?

Note what Jehovah gave his people as a reason behind this law : “ You must not go about following your hearts and your eyes , which you are following in immoral intercourse . ”
Who can know it ? ”

Modesty is not something we can simply define in a way that suits us .
Do Not Follow “ Unrealities ”
Although Jehovah allowed them to have a human king , he had his prophet Samuel deliver a pointed warning about pursuing “ unrealities . ” ​ — Read 1 Samuel 12 : 21 .
In what ways did the Israelites pursue unrealities ?
Human kings would easily lead them into idolatry .

They cannot see , hear , speak , or act .
( a ) How does Satan lure many today into pursuing unrealities ?
Money , possessions , and high - paying jobs may seem to deliver advantages .
What relief can they deliver in the face of death ?
In the long run , they cannot even provide physical security , for they have no lasting effect on the present brevity of human life or the likelihood of sickness and death .
If we continue to heed his loving warnings against three bad influences ​ — the crowd , our own hearts , and unrealities — ​ we will be much more likely to reach our destination of everlasting life .
• Numbers 15 : 37 - 39
[ Picture on page 11 ]
Are you ever tempted to follow the crowd ?
[ Picture on page 13 ]
Why is it dangerous to follow an impulse ?
1 , 2 .
All the bad influences discussed in the preceding article originate with him and are aimed at causing us to veer off the road that leads to eternal life .
Thankfully , our benevolent God warns us not to follow Satan’s misleading ‘ road signs . ’
As we consider how God’s Word helps us to avoid being misled , we might imagine that Jehovah is walking behind us and is pointing us in the right direction , saying : “ This is the way .
False teachers are like dried - up wells .
Who are such teachers ?
The inspired words of these two apostles help us to identify where false teachers come from and how they operate .
Their aim , Paul explained , is “ to draw away the disciples after themselves . ”
Rather than going out and making their own disciples , apostates seek to take Christ’s disciples with them .
2 : 18 .
And just as a clever forger tries to pass phony documents , so apostates use “ counterfeit words , ” or false arguments , trying to pass their fabricated views as if they were true .
Following them would only divert us from the road that leads to eternal life .
The Bible gives us what clear counsel regarding false teachers ?
How can we protect ourselves against false teachers ?
“ Avoid them , ” says God’s Word .
Other translations render that phrase “ turn away from them , ” “ keep away from them , ” and “ stay away from them ! ”
Well , apostates are “ mentally diseased , ” and they seek to infect others with their disloyal teachings .
Why , then , allow yourself to be soured by anyone who would denigrate the organization through which you learned these truths ? ​ — John 6 : 66 - 69 .
At times , it may be easy to discern that a road sign has been tampered with and is pointing the wrong way .
The apostle Paul warns us about one of Satan’s insidious strategies ​ — “ false stories . ”
* Such stories only “ furnish questions for research ” ​ — that is , raise frivolous questions that lead to pointless research .
Christendom also promotes holidays , such as Christmas and Easter , whose seemingly innocent customs are actually rooted in mythology and paganism .
( b ) How can we avoid being misled by Satan’s false stories ?
The truth is that we have a desperate need for moral guidance that only God can fill .
Believing this satanic lie could cause us to give up , feeling that we could never be worthy of God’s love .
Those first - century Christian women may not have thought that they were following Satan , but their actions amounted to just that .
How can we guard against even unwittingly following Satan ?

May we never waver in our determination to heed Jehovah’s admonition : “ This is the way . Walk in it . ” ​ — Isa .
30 : 21 .

The Greek word for “ devil ” is di·aʹbo·los , which means “ slanderer . ”
12 : 9 , 10 .
What Is Your Answer ?
How can you make personal application of the warnings contained in the following scriptures ?
• 1 Timothy 5 : 11 - 15
The wise man had one request : The gossiper was told to go and take a feather pillow and cut it open , scattering the feathers to the wind .
“ It is as difficult to repair the damage done by your words as it is to recover the feathers . ”
The lesson is clear .
Once spoken , words cannot be retrieved , and it may be impossible to undo the hurt they cause .
4 : 9 .
FROM the first chapter of Genesis , we learn that God prepared the earth for human habitation during six figurative days .
The end of each of these periods is marked by the words : “ There came to be evening and there came to be morning . ”
However , with respect to the seventh day , the Bible states : “ God proceeded to bless the seventh day and make it sacred , because on it he has been resting from all his work that God has created . ” ​ — Gen .
That suggests that the seventh day ​ — God’s “ day ” of rest — ​ was under way in 1513 B.C.E . when Moses wrote the book of Genesis .
If so , can we enter into it today ?
First , consider Jesus ’ words to opposers who criticized him for healing on the Sabbath , which they construed as a form of work .
Thus , Jesus implied that as regards the earth , God’s great Sabbath day of rest , the seventh day , had not ended in his day .
What further evidence does Paul furnish that the seventh day was ongoing in his day ?
When quoting Genesis 2 : 2 concerning God’s rest , Paul wrote under inspiration : “ We who have exercised faith do enter into the rest . ”
So the seventh day was ongoing in Paul’s day .
Notice that Paul links disobedience with failure to enter into God’s rest .
What did Jehovah have in mind when he delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt , and what was expected of them ?
He told the Israelites : “ If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant [ as outlined in the Law code ] , then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples , because the whole earth belongs to me . ”
What lifestyle could the Israelites have enjoyed if they had been obedient to God ?
When the Messiah appeared , he would likely have found Israel functioning well as an independent nation , not cringing under the Roman whip .
Why , they even demanded to return to Egypt !
No wonder Jehovah said of those rebels : “ I became disgusted with this generation and said , ‘ They always go astray in their hearts , and they themselves have not come to know my ways . ’
By seeking to return to Egypt , that wayward nation showed that it esteemed as of little value the spiritual blessings it had received , preferring instead the leeks , onions , and garlic that were available in Egypt .
12 : 16 .
Notwithstanding the faithlessness of the generation of Israelites that left Egypt , Jehovah “ kept working ” patiently toward the fulfillment of his purpose , now focusing his attention on the next generation .
“ The people of God ” Paul was referring to were Christians .
Does that mean that Christians could enter into God’s rest ?
( b ) in the first century ?
Certain Christians failed to recognize that , and they insisted on continuing to observe certain aspects of the Law .
What was preventing some Christians in Paul’s day from entering into God’s rest ?
They failed to recognize that the Law had served its purpose and that Jehovah was leading his people in a different direction .
Entering Into God’s Rest Today
16 , 17 . ( a ) What does it mean to enter into God’s rest today ?
( b ) What will be discussed in the next article ?
This could endanger our peaceful relationship with Jehovah .
Whether any Jewish Christian would have gone so far as to support arrangements for the Day of Atonement after Pentecost 33 C.E . is not known .
To do so would certainly show a lack of respect for Jesus ’ sacrifice .
4 : 9 - 11 .
4 : 12 .
When we learn that Jehovah disapproves of something that we enjoy , for example , our initial reaction might be to rebel .
2 , 3 .
Finally , after much prayer and effort on our part , the blessed day arrived when we were able to present ourselves for Christian baptism . ​ — Read Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 .
We are assured , though , that if we keep up the struggle and are determined to become ever more desirable in God’s eyes , Jehovah will bless our efforts .
When Counsel Is Needed
Curiously , when we pray , we freely admit that we are imperfect .
However , when someone draws a specific failing to our attention , the tendency is to try to justify ourselves , minimize the problem , question the motive of the counselor , or object to the way in which the counsel was delivered .
And if the counsel touches a particularly sensitive area ​ — the actions of a family member , our dress and grooming , our personal hygiene , or a form of recreation that we enjoy but that Jehovah hates — ​ we might react quite negatively , to our own surprise and to our counselor’s dismay !
This should not trouble us ; it should bolster our confidence in the faithful and discreet slave class .
The slave class is more interested in cooperating with God’s unfolding purpose than in shielding itself from criticism over an adjusted understanding .
Some accomplished public speakers flatly refused to try anything new .
Outwardly , they appeared to be spiritual men , fully devoted to the Lord .
10 : 1 - 6 ; Acts 5 : 42 ; 20 : 20 .
How do you react when you are invited to share in some form of the preaching work that is presently out of your comfort zone ?
Are you willing to try something new ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What is Jehovah’s purpose in having unrepentant wrongdoers disfellowshipped ?
There may be occasions , though , when our loyalty to this aspect of God’s purpose is sorely tested .

The parents are devastated !
Our hearts go out to those parents .
After all , their son had a choice , and he chose to pursue his unchristian lifestyle rather than to continue to enjoy close association with his parents and other fellow believers .
But what will those dear parents do ?
Of course , that ended any association those men could have had with their parents .
The message is clear .
Today , Jehovah does not immediately execute those who violate his laws .
18 , 19 .
In recommending the reinstatement of one young woman , the elders wrote that she had cleaned up her life “ partly because of her fleshly brother’s respect for the disfellowshipping arrangement . ”
That we need to fight against the tendency of our imperfect hearts to rebel against Scriptural counsel .
Paul’s point was that God does not make a promise and then forget about it .
Jehovah established this through the prophet Isaiah : “ My word . . . will not return to me without results , but it will . . . have certain success in that for which I have sent it . ”

What about you ?
Have you personally entered into God’s rest ?
They did not keep up with God’s advancing purpose .
See “ Keep Yourselves in God’s Love , ” pages 207 - 209 .
Do Not Miss the Purpose
Dispelling My Fear of Death
Then in 1930 , when I was only six years old , my mother , Luigia , died .
Growing up as a Catholic , I observed religious rules and attended weekly Mass .
In 1944 , World War II was reaping a deadly harvest .
Upon arrival we were taken to a number of refugee camps .
I was sent to one near Steinach , in the northeast of the country .
One of the barber’s customers was Adolfo Tellini , an Italian living in Switzerland .
He was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Adolfo and other Witnesses would visit us in the camp every now and again .
I was particularly struck by a slide presentation of extermination camps , showing piles of bodies .
I had not had a systematic Bible study , but I had the fundamental truths clearly in mind .
In May 1947 , the first postwar assembly in Italy was held in Milan .
Something rather unusual took place at this assembly .
I decided that I would begin full - time service within a month .
Yet , I was determined .
The fifth member of the family was Giuseppe Tubini , who had just joined them , and I was the sixth .
Even so , I encouraged those in attendance , including many young ones , to think about taking up the full - time ministry .
I had begun an exciting life as a traveling overseer .
The Religious Scene in Postwar Italy
Let me tell you something about the religious situation in Italy back then .
As a result of pressure from the clergy , circuit assemblies were often interrupted .
But sometimes the clergy’s efforts failed miserably , which is what happened in 1948 at Sulmona , a small town in central Italy .
Intent on creating confusion , he started yelling at the top of his voice .
I immediately told him , “ If you have something to say , rent a hall , and you can say whatever you like . ”
At this , the young man jumped off the stage and disappeared .
On occasion , my accommodations were a stable or a toolshed .
In 1950 , Giuseppe Tubini and I were invited to attend the 16th class of the missionary school of Gilead .
I remember the instructor’s comment as if it were yesterday , “ Your gestures and your enthusiasm are excellent , but your English is totally incomprehensible ! ”
Despite this , I managed to complete the course successfully .
Thereafter , Giuseppe and I were reassigned to Italy .
With the extra training , we were both better equipped to serve the brothers .
Lidia too was a real fighter for the truth .
She faced three court cases before our legal right to preach from house to house was eventually recognized .
In 1972 we had another son , Marco .
For example , in the early 1980 ’ s , my father - in - law wrote to the then president of Italy , Sandro Pertini .
Then we talked about our faith and gave him some literature .
For the next four years , I served as an Assembly Hall overseer until I had to lighten my activity because of a serious illness .
I thank Jehovah that my vigor has not diminished with age .
May all honor go to our loving Creator , whose name we have the privilege of bearing . ​ — Ps .

On our wedding day
I tried to explain why I was upset , but he cut me off .
Men and women communicate differently , and they have unique needs .
A woman may long to share her feelings openly and often .
Many men , on the other hand , try to preserve peace by solving problems quickly and avoiding thorny issues .
In marriage , however , the challenge is to show respect for someone with whom you are on more of an equal footing ​ — your mate .
Disrespect creates tension in the home and leads to bitter conflict .
How can you communicate respectfully ?
Why ?
“ He doesn’t even have to agree or figure out why the problem arose .
I just want him to listen to me and validate my feelings . ”
If you draw a bucket out of a well too quickly , you will lose a lot of water .
For example , when a sick man approached him for help , Jesus did not immediately solve the problem .
By doing so , you will show that you respect your mate .
Later , approach your mate and ask , “ Did you feel that I was really listening to you ? ”
Impart a favorable impression of your spouse by the way you speak about him or her .
Phil , married for eight years , admits that he and his wife still have disagreements .
TRY THIS : With your mate , set aside time to discuss the suggestions under this subheading .
Try to apply the suggestions you hear .
Sometimes he is able to relax when I’m worried , so I end up feeling angry because it appears that he doesn’t care about something as much as I do . ”
Accept each other as you are , and respect what is different about your mate .
When she is happy , I really am too . ”
“ It is definitely worth cultivating . ”
The Bible , however , offers comfort that can ease the pain of repentant sinners .
David knew that “ Jehovah is merciful ” and does not “ keep finding fault ” with us .
As far as we can imagine .
One Bible reference work says : “ Fly as far as the wing of imagination can bear you , and if you journey through space eastward , you are further from the west at every beat of your wing . ”
David , a father himself , knew what a loving father feels in his heart .
Such a father is moved to show compassion to his children , especially when they are in pain .
Perhaps you too will feel that a weight is being lifted off you .

Do you know what bad thing happens to Dorcas now ? — She becomes very sick and dies .
Peter and other apostles have performed miracles before , but never has any one of them brought a dead person back to life .
Then he calls in the widows and the others and shows her to them .
And he will reward you with everlasting life in happiness in his righteous new world .
False prophets have corrupted Christianity and have used it to further their own interests .
He helped people to know God and taught them to pray that God’s name be sanctified .
God’s Kingdom is the only hope for mankind .
If someone approaches you to speak about God’s Kingdom , to which religion does he likely belong ? ​ — Read Matthew 10 : 7 ; 24 : 14 .
Also , they do not imitate the world’s harmful practices and attitudes . ​ — Read James 1 : 27 ; 4 : 4 .
True Christians have outstanding love for one another .
From God’s Word , they learn to respect members of all ethnic groups .
Although false religion has often strongly supported the wars of the nations , true worshippers refuse to do so .
Which group bases all its teachings on God’s Word , honors God’s name , and proclaims God’s Kingdom as mankind’s only hope ?
Which group practices love and does not support war ?

Purpose of Study Articles
The first article highlights Bible examples that encourage us to be peacemakers .
As you travel down the “ information superhighway , ” you can pick up facts , statistics , and opinions on a wide variety of subjects .
The ability to communicate is a wonderful gift from our Creator .
Jehovah was the first to communicate with his human family , providing clear , unambiguous information on how to lead a meaningful life .
As made evident by what happened early in human history , however , the gift of communication can be misused .
She accepted what he said and passed it on to Adam , who led humankind into a course of calamity . ​ — Gen .
5 : 12 .
What can be said about using the Internet ?
Information ​ — Reliable or False ?
Would you start eating these mushrooms without carefully examining each one ?
We need discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff , as it were , lest we poison our minds with misinformation .
Long ago , Satan hid behind a serpent to start a “ chat ” with Eve and told her that she could be like God .
Do not become an “ Internet Eve . ”
In the first century , the apostle Paul gave Timothy advice that applies with equal force today .
If used wisely , the Internet can undoubtedly save us time , energy , and funds .
We can conveniently buy something without leaving home .
The Internet provides essential tools to work out a convenient and economical itinerary for a trip we may be planning and helps us make the necessary bookings .
For some , the Internet has become a fascinating toy instead of a helpful tool .
They spend excessive amounts of time playing , shopping , chatting , e - mailing , searching , and surfing .
For example , an estimate published in 2010 indicated that 18.4 percent of Korean adolescents were affected by Internet addiction .
Happily , he realized the seriousness of the problem and took measures to correct it .
At 1 Thessalonians 5 : 21 , 22 , we read : “ Make sure of all things ; hold fast to what is fine .
Abstain from every form of wickedness . ”
If the answer is yes , we would do well to use the Internet only when others are present .
In addition , it has opened up a completely new way to ‘ commit adultery in our heart . ’ ​ — Matt .
Using the Internet includes getting information as well as distributing it .
It can also flood us with information .
That may be necessary in some cases .
What should you consider before hitting the send button ?
Michael [ age seven ] will often draw a picture or write a paragraph .
• Prepare for the Congregation Bible Study or the Watchtower Study .
• Prepare presentations for the field ministry .
in Awake ! of March 8 , 1996 , pages 16 - 19 . )
How startled they are when Jehovah’s angel stands nearby and God’s glory gleams around them ! Listen !
I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have , because there was born to you today a Savior , who is Christ the Lord , ” the one who would prove to be the Messiah .
3 , 4 .
When John the Baptizer came on the scene years later , his words and deeds led some to wonder if the Messiah had arrived .
It is possible that some correctly understood a Messianic prophecy involving “ seventy weeks . ”
Those weeks ended 483 years later , in 29 C.E . , when Jesus of Nazareth was baptized and anointed with holy spirit , thus becoming the Messiah . ​ — Matt .
3 : 13 - 17 .
This will undoubtedly strengthen our faith in God’s prophetic word .
Many Jewish scholars of the past associated those words with the Messiah .
Starting with the rule of Judean King David , the scepter ( royal sovereignty ) and the commander’s staff ( power to command ) resided with the tribe of Judah .
After Zedekiah , Jesus was the only descendant of David to whom kingship was promised .
“ You , O Bethlehem Ephrathah , the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah , ” wrote the prophet Micah , “ from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel , whose origin is from early times , from the days of time indefinite . ”
8 , 9 .
What was foretold about the Messiah’s birth and the events that followed it ?
The Messiah would be born of a virgin .
There it was prophesied that “ the maiden [ ha·ʽal·mahʹ ] ” would give birth to a son .
1 : 18 - 25 ; Luke 1 : 26 - 35 .
Something similar happened centuries earlier when Egypt’s Pharaoh decreed that Hebrew male babies be cast into the Nile River .
Matthew shows that Jeremiah’s words were fulfilled when King Herod ordered the slaughter of young male children in Bethlehem and its surrounding territory .
Before Herod’s death - dealing decree , an angel directed that Joseph , Mary , and Jesus go to Egypt .
Jesus did not arrange for John to do an Elijahlike work as His forerunner .
What commission helps to identify the Messiah ?
Galilee of the nations , ” Isaiah wrote : “ The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light .
Matthew tells us so .
Proverbial sayings , or parables , were among Jesus ’ effective means of teaching .

Despite all the good done by the Messiah , many people would not believe in him .
Showing that this prophecy was fulfilled , the apostle John wrote : “ Although [ Jesus ] had performed so many signs before them , they were not putting faith in him , so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said : ‘ Jehovah , who has put faith in the thing heard by us ?
Also , few put faith in the good news about Jesus , the Messiah , during the ministry of the apostle Paul . ​ — Rom .
But it is that the word written in their Law may be fulfilled , ‘ They hated me without cause . ’ ”
Often the “ Law ” means the whole body of Scripture .
Additional Messianic prophecies will be examined in the next article .
Our prayerful reflection on them will surely strengthen our conviction that Jesus Christ truly is the Messiah who was appointed by our heavenly Father , Jehovah .
How Would You Answer ?
• What prophecies were fulfilled in connection with Jesus ’ birth ?

JOHN THE BAPTIZER is standing with two of his disciples .

Your king himself comes to you .
He is righteous , yes , saved ; humble , and riding upon an ass , even upon a full - grown animal the son of a she - ass . ”
Jesus could not have manipulated the crowd’s actions .
Explain what happened in fulfillment of Psalm 118 : 22 , 23 .
Betrayed and Abandoned !
A person who ate bread with someone was thought to be his friend .
Jesus called attention to the fulfillment of David’s prophetic words when He referred to his betrayer and told his apostles : “ I am not talking about all of you ; I know the ones I have chosen .
The Messiah’s betrayer would receive 30 pieces of silver ​ — the price of a slave !
In Matthew’s day , Jeremiah may have been placed first in a group of Bible books that included Zechariah .
How did Zechariah 13 : 7 undergo fulfillment ?
And that is exactly what happened , for Matthew reported that “ all the disciples abandoned [ Jesus ] and fled . ” ​ — Matt .
26 : 31 , 56 .
False witnesses would testify against the Messiah .
“ Violent witnesses rise up , ” said the psalmist David .
“ My back I gave to the strikers , and my cheeks to those plucking off the hair , ” wrote the prophet . “ My face I did not conceal from humiliating things and spit . ”
How did Psalm 22 : 16 and Isaiah 53 : 12 apply to Jesus ?
Aspects of the Messiah’s impalement were foretold .

David prophesied that the Messiah would be reviled .
The Messiah would be given vinegar and gall .
27 : 34 , 48 .
Late in the afternoon of Nisan 14 , “ a rich man of Arimathea , named Joseph , ” asked Pilate for Jesus ’ body , and the request was granted .
There they encountered a materialized angel , who told them : “ Stop being stunned .
God did not allow the physical body of his beloved Son to decay .
How privileged we are to proclaim these truths as Witnesses of Jehovah , whose beloved Son already reigns in heaven as the Messianic King !
A careful study of the Hebrew Scriptures enables us to identify dozens of prophecies that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ .
For example , Edersheim said that the Jews regarded Genesis 8 : 11 as Messianic .
The author also mentioned Exodus 12 : 42 .
Take , for example , Isaiah chapter 53 , which contains several prophetic features regarding the Messiah .
Consider , too , Isaiah 11 : 1 , which reads : “ There must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse ; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful . ”
Hence , we do well to avoid being specific about the total number of Messianic prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures .
Moreover , the numerous Messianic prophecies , whatever their number , give us solid evidence that Jesus is the Christ , or Messiah .

“ BY THE time this meeting is over , you will say , ‘ This was truly a theocratic history - making annual meeting ! ’ ”
With those words , Stephen Lett of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses intensified the sense of keen anticipation in the large audience .
Its heavenly part , composed of spirit creatures , moves with lightning speed ​ — the speed of Jehovah’s own thoughts , Brother Lett said .
Many honesthearted Haitians are thus finding comfort in learning the truth about why our times are so troubled .
He eventually studied with the man , who responded well and came to love Jehovah .
Alex Reinmueller , a helper to the Publishing Committee , told of how he made the truth his own while pioneering in Canada when he was only 15 years old , often working by himself .
His wife , Sarah , told of her friendship with a sister who endured decades in Chinese prisons for her faith .
Sarah said that she has learned to rely on Jehovah through personal prayer .
His wife , Krista , spoke fondly of being influenced by older members of the Bethel family who proved to be “ faithful in what is least , ” as Jesus recommended . ​ — Luke 16 : 10 .
His wife , Ketra , told of how she learned about loyalty when serving as a pioneer in a congregation that was afflicted with apostasy and other problems .
A program highlight was a symposium about Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia and their legal struggles .
This highly respected Court admits very few of the cases presented to it .
He spoke enthusiastically about the school and the appreciative response from the elders who have attended .
and the destruction of false religion .
Brother Morris warned against saying , “ This must be Armageddon , ” in response to events in the news that do not fulfill such prophecies .
“ May your heart be strong , ” he said , “ all you who are waiting for Jehovah . ” ​ — Ps .
This school would give couples further training so that they can be more useful to Jehovah’s organization .

Jehovah has blessed the preaching work in Ethiopia
How are we to understand the figures in the annual service report ?
Each year , we look forward to the service report published in the Yearbook .
It is thrilling to see what Jehovah’s people as a group have accomplished in the worldwide Kingdom preaching and teaching work .
But to derive the greatest benefit from the report , we need a correct understanding of the entries as well as a balanced view of the figures .
Service year .
“ Publishers ” includes baptized Witnesses of Jehovah as well as unbaptized ones who qualify to be Kingdom preachers .
In this way some publishers may be counted twice .
“ Average publishers ” is the typical number of different ones reporting time in the ministry each month .
Total hours .
Money spent .
Not necessarily . A number of factors ​ — including past religious beliefs or even mental or emotional imbalance — ​ might cause some to assume mistakenly that they have the heavenly calling .
[ Footnote ]
Esau has heard that his twin brother , Jacob , is returning home .
Does Jehovah answer this prayer ?
Yes . “ Esau went running to meet him , ” the Bible tells us , “ and he began to embrace him and fall upon his neck and kiss him . ” ​ — Gen .
32 : 11 - 20 ; 33 : 1 - 4 .

It also shows that the true God blesses our prayerful efforts to make peace .
A Superlative Example to Exhort Us
Still , out of his great love , Jehovah arranged for our salvation by sending his beloved Son from heaven to be born as a perfect human .
How does the provision of the ransom sacrifice of God’s Son affect the damaged relationship between God and sinful mankind ?
“ The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him , ” states Isaiah 53 : 5 , “ and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us . ”
“ By means of [ Jesus ] we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one , yes , the forgiveness of our trespasses . ” ​ — Eph .
1 : 7 .
What are they ? ​ — Read Colossians 1 : 19 , 20 .
( Read Romans 5 : 1 . )
On the other hand , “ the things upon the earth ” refer to repentant humans , who will eventually attain to everlasting life on earth . ​ — Ps .
37 : 29 .
How did Abraham pursue peace with his Philistine neighbors ?
The Philistines had “ seized by violence ” a well of water dug by Abraham’s servants at Beer - sheba .
Rather than fight back and repossess his well , Abraham chose to remain silent about the matter .
Shocked to hear about this , the king restored the well to Abraham .
Because of a famine in the land , Isaac moved his household north , from Beer - lahai - roi in the arid region of the Negeb into the more fertile territory of the Philistines at Gerar .
24 : 62 ; 26 : 1 , 12 - 17 .
Philistine shepherds claimed that the water was theirs .
The Philistines also claimed this one for themselves .
Isaac surely had the ability to fight for his right to use all the wells that his servants had dug .
Still , for the sake of peace , Isaac had more than once opted to move rather than fight .
This time too Isaac proved himself to be a peacemaker .
26 : 26 - 31 .
Learning From the Son Whom Jacob Loved the Most
However , Joseph’s older brothers became so jealous of him that they were unable to speak peacefully to him .
Cruelly , they sold Joseph into slavery and tricked their father into believing that Joseph had been killed by a wild beast . ​ — Gen .
16 , 17 .
Jehovah proved to be with Joseph .
In time , Joseph became Egypt’s prime minister ​ — second in power only to Pharaoh .
When a severe famine brought Joseph’s brothers to Egypt , they did not even recognize him in his official Egyptian attire .
Then he proceeded to kiss all his brothers and to weep over them . ​ — Gen .
45 : 1 , 5 , 15 .
Does not appreciatively reflecting on what Jehovah has done to heal the damaged relationship between him and sinful mankind move us to do all we can to pursue peace with others ?
Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy peace among themselves ?
Rather than taking sides in political issues , we remain neutral .
Hence , differences and misunderstandings between fellow believers are bound to arise .
“ [ Love ] does not keep account of the injury , ” states 1 Corinthians 13 : 5 .
When offended , we pursue peace by forgiving and forgetting , that is , by ‘ not keeping account of the injury . ’
What should we do if it is too difficult for us to overlook an offense committed against us ?
The apostle Paul wrote : “ Be wrathful , and yet do not sin ; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state , neither allow place for the Devil . ”
“ Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law , ” said Jesus .
Why ?
Because doing so prevents differences from festering like an untreated , infected wound .
( b ) What counsel did Paul give Roman Christians regarding their dispute ?
That was the case with Christians in Rome to whom the apostle Paul wrote an inspired letter .
What advice did Paul give the congregation ? ​ — Rom .
Having counseled both sides in this dispute , Paul wrote : “ So , then , let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another . ” ​ — Rom .
When differences among fellow Christians occur today , should we not likewise settle disputes graciously by humbly seeking and applying Scriptural counsel ?
What if a Christian wants to talk to an elder about a problem he or she is having with a relative or with a fellow believer ?
God’s appointed Judge , Jesus Christ , judges righteously .
Before they make judgments respecting fellow believers , elders need to pray for the help of Jehovah’s spirit and depend on its guidance by consulting God’s Word and the publications of the faithful and discreet slave class . ​ — Matt .
If a Christian becomes aware of a serious sin on the part of a fellow believer , he should encourage that one to confess the sin to the elders .
With that , Jehu drew his bow and shot Jehoram through the heart .
Most disputes between brothers do not involve serious wrongdoing that requires judicial action .
“ The one covering over transgression is seeking love , ” says God’s Word , “ and he that keeps talking about a matter is separating those familiar with one another . ”
18 , 19 .
What benefits result from pursuing peace ?
Our pursuing “ the things making for peace ” brings us rich blessings .

A husband can strive to allay any feelings of insecurity his wife may have .
• What especially good news can we offer to the poor ?
The good news is : God has appointed Jesus as King .
He is the ideal Ruler to end poverty .
No . Though Jesus could have been the source of billions of perfect descendants , such potential offspring were not part of the ransom .
They do not receive into their homes or greet false teachers .
Christians avoid the literature of apostates , TV programs featuring them , and Web sites containing their teachings . ​ — 7 / 15 , pages 15 - 16 .

30 For Young People ​ — Falsely Accused !

Far from denying the Devil’s power over mankind , Jesus actually confirmed it by speaking of him as “ the ruler of the world , ” describing him as “ a murderer ” and “ a liar . ” ​ — John 14 : 30 ; 8 : 44 ; The New Jerusalem Bible .
Some 60 years after Christ’s encounter with the Devil , the apostle John reminded Christians of the Devil’s powerful influence , saying that “ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
The World Ruler Delegates Power to Associates
The angel was obviously not referring to Persian King Cyrus , who at that time looked with favor upon Daniel and his people .
Later in the account , God’s angel stated that he would once again have to fight against “ the prince of Persia ” and another demon prince , “ the prince of Greece . ” ​ — Daniel 10 : 20 .
Can anyone honestly say that the shocking and horrifying events that have tainted the pages of human history were the normal activity of humans ?
The Bible unmistakably identifies and unmasks the one who has been maneuvering human leaders and world powers .
The Devil’s Last Gasp
They draw hope from Paul’s words to fellow Christians : “ The God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly . ”
▪ To many , the word “ Armageddon ” evokes scenes of mass destruction ​ — nuclear war , large - scale natural disasters , or even an “ environmental Armageddon ” jump - started by global warming .
This “ one seated on the horse ” is God’s Son , Jesus Christ , who is appointed by God to lead legions of angelic warriors to victory over God’s enemies .
Their defiance is described at Psalm 2 : 2 : “ The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one . ”
God would then “ bring to ruin those ruining the earth . ”
Armageddon is the way sanctioned by God to resolve the issue of who has the right to rule over all humanity . ​ — Psalm 83 : 18 .
Happy is the one that stays awake . ”
But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth , and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 .
Learn From God’s Word
Jehovah invites people of all nations to draw close to him in prayer .
Also , the prayers of a man who mistreats his wife can be hindered .
Yet , God will hear even gross sinners if they repent . ​ — Read 2 Chronicles 33 : 9 - 13 .
How should we pray ?
Since we are imperfect , we should pray in the name of Jesus because he is the appointed “ way . ”
For more information , see chapter 17 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ O Jehovah , . . .
* Can you relate to those words ?
Have you ever felt that no one cares about or understands what you are going through , let alone how you feel ?
Confident of God’s interest in him , David says : “ O Jehovah , you have searched through me , and you know me . ”
David knows that Jehovah has a positive motive in scrutinizing His worshippers .
When examining the things his worshippers say and do each day , Jehovah treasures the good .
Psalm 139 teaches us that Jehovah deeply cares about his worshippers .

Why did I read in secret ?
Enthralled , I read from eight at night until four in the morning .
During the second world war , coal was a commodity of national importance .
When I was 21 , a classmate handed me my first Bible , saying , “ It is a book worth reading . ”
Read it I did , and I have never regretted doing so .
But on September 1 , 1947 , our work in France was legally recognized again .
Because there was not even one pioneer in France , the December 1947 issue of Informant ( now Our Kingdom Ministry ) launched an appeal for general pioneers , who would preach 150 hours a month .
My first assignment , Agen , in southern France , was short - lived .
Here again , what I read in the Bible helped me .
I decided to visit a family I used to call on , and the lady of the house was overjoyed : “ Oh , Mr . Leroy , you’ve been released !
* He was an interpreter in the port and was looking for a night watchman to guard a ship .
On that one day , I obtained lodging , work , and food !
We were offered accommodations in an old horse stable , where we slept on straw mattresses .
We spent our days in the service .
I had many Bible studies , and some of them later took up full - time service and missionary work .
When I started in the circuit work , there were few cars , televisions , or typewriters in that region and no transistor radios or personal computers .
In fact , it was a most joyful time .
Irène and I were married in 1956 , and she joined me in the circuit work .
How would it be possible to buy out time to read God’s Word ?
I also take pleasure in conducting Bible discussions at morning worship before breakfast .
The Best Way of Life
We enjoy taking the bus to our congregation territory to share this hope with others .
Throughout my life , Jehovah has strengthened me by means of his Word .
My relatives predicted over 60 years ago that Bible reading would be a lifelong habit .

Irène and I enjoy reading and studying God’s Word
You might also wonder , ‘ Can Jehovah really be the share of any imperfect Christian today ? ’
Then God made this significant adjustment : “ I do take the Levites . . . in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel . ”
( b ) How did God provide for the Levites ?
The context of Numbers 18 : 20 shows that this did not leave them impoverished materially .
You might wonder , ‘ If the Levites had no land assigned to them , where would they reside ? ’
God provided for them .
The Law did not include any penalty for an Israelite who failed to tithe .
That happened in the days of Nehemiah .
Furthermore , the priests and Levites themselves needed faith in Jehovah and in his means of providing for them .
His faithful service would not be forgotten .
Having Jehovah as his share meant more to Asaph than the material sustenance he received as a Levite .
What he referred to was mainly his privilege of service and his relationship with Jehovah , the friendship he had cultivated with the Most High .
You can have the same confidence in the Almighty .
What question did Jeremiah have , and how was it answered ?
Jeremiah lived in Anathoth , a Levite city near Jerusalem .
After observing what was taking place in Jerusalem and Judah , he felt compelled to ‘ complain ’ about what he saw .
In harmony with divine prophecies , those who obeyed Jehovah’s direction ‘ received their souls as spoil , ’ whereas the prosperous wicked ones ignored the warning and perished . ​ — Jer .
That caused Jeremiah pain , though he was not at fault .
But Jeremiah’s expression “ Jehovah is my share ” revealed his confidence in divine mercy , and it gave him reason for showing “ a waiting attitude . ”
Jehovah was their only hope .
36 : 20 - 23 .
He was in a cave , hiding from his enemies .
On at least two occasions , David took refuge in caves ​ — one near Adullam and the other in the wilderness of En - gedi .
He may well have composed Psalm 142 in one of those caves .
Both the Levites and those of Israel’s other tribes , such as David , could let God be their share .
• Asaph , Jeremiah , and David did what , showing that Jehovah was their share ?
• What quality do you need if God is to be your share ?
The Levites did not receive a land inheritance .

Are You Letting Jehovah Be Your Share ?
“ Keep on . . . seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness , and all these other things will be added to you . ” ​ — MATT .
WHEN you read the name Israel in the Bible , what comes to your mind ?
They will benefit from the priestly services of the 144,000 .
They are not content to do just a little when they sense that they can do more .
Others manage to pioneer some months each year .
Consider how we do so in four specific areas .
( a ) How do people in general show that their share is in this life only ?
( b ) Why is it better to have David’s outlook ?
Jesus taught his followers to seek first the Kingdom and God’s righteousness .
People of the world tend to seek personal interests first as “ men of this system of things , whose share is in this life . ”
What blessing did one brother receive for putting the Kingdom first ?
Consider Jean - Claude , in the Central African Republic .
In that land , finding work is hard , and most people will do almost anything to keep their job .
You must devote your life to your work ​ — nothing but your work .
What would you have done ?
Thus , he attended the next midweek meeting .
Seeking First God’s Righteousness
Give an example .
5 : 14 .
Andrew took much pride in his job but left it .
Because he was working for a nonneutral organization and was determined to put first God’s righteousness .
Cite local examples .
Jesus told his disciples : “ If you have faith the size of a mustard grain , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Transfer from here to there , ’ and it will transfer , and nothing will be impossible for you . ”
If you are uncertain whether you could do so , speak with other members of the congregation .
You will no doubt find it spiritually refreshing to hear their experiences .
How do you react when Jehovah , the Source of spiritual enlightenment , sheds light on “ the deep things of God ” found in the Bible ?
Taking those words literally , many disciples said : “ This speech is shocking ; who can listen to it ? ”
You have sayings of everlasting life . ” ​ — John 6 : 53 , 60 , 66 , 68 .
But the apostle relied on God for spiritual enlightenment .
The first - century Beroeans received the word “ with the greatest eagerness of mind , carefully examining the Scriptures daily . ”
God kindly takes in such ones .
“ Before [ God ] I kept pouring out my concern , ” he said .
“ Before him I continued to tell about my own distress , when my spirit fainted away within me . ”
“ I have never resolved to remain single , ” says a sister in the United States .
I asked her if she wanted to be responsible if my marriage turned out badly .
She stopped pressuring me . ”
The Most High of the universe is listening , so how could I not feel dignified and joyful ? ”
When I am thinking , ‘ What can I do to help this person ? ’
I have inner joy . ”
See Awake !
How can you let Jehovah be your share

The so - called elite runners enter the race with one objective ​ — to win .
The apostle Paul called this point to the attention of his fellow Christians in ancient Corinth in his first letter to them .
Because the prize ​ — whether life in heaven or life in Paradise on earth — ​ is beyond compare .
How can you avoid them ?
Before we examine Paul’s inspired advice to the Hebrew Christians to see what lessons there are for us , let us consider what prompted Paul to write the letter and what he was trying to encourage his readers to do .
Jesus had told them about the destruction to come upon the unfaithful Jewish nation .
What might have caused some Christians to slow down or give out ?
At the time Paul wrote his letter to the Hebrews , nearly 30 years had passed since Jesus gave that warning .
How did the passage of time affect those Christians ?
Other Christians were persuaded or intimidated by individuals in the congregation who clamored for sticking to the Mosaic Law and tradition .
In chapter 10 of his letter , Paul pointed out that the Law was but “ a shadow of the good things to come ” and clearly demonstrated the value of the ransom sacrifice of Christ .
10 : 1 , 36 , 37 .
Rather , they were participants , like runners in a race . And they had successfully run the race and finished it .
Imagine how a contestant would feel if he knew that surrounding , or watching , him were some of the most accomplished runners .
We are living near the end of the present system of things .
What these men went through , their successes and failures , as well as their strengths and weaknesses , is truly worthy of our consideration . ​ — Rom .
( Read Hebrews 11 : 7 . )
“ The deluge of waters upon the earth [ that would ] bring to ruin all flesh ” was something that Noah had “ not yet beheld . ”
Why did Moses not become despondent when he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land ?
With the Israelites poised to enter the Promised Land , Moses was told : “ From a distance you will see the land , but you will not go there into the land that I am giving to the sons of Israel . ”
We are able to see “ the One who is invisible ” and thus run the race with endurance . ​ — 2 Cor .
The Christian race is not easy .
“ Run in such a way that you may attain it . ” ​ — 1 COR .
9 : 24 .
IN HIS letter to the Hebrews , the apostle Paul used a powerful word picture to encourage his fellow Christians .
All demonstrated that unshakable faith enabled them to remain loyal to God , as if they were pressing on in a race to the finish .
As noted in that article , Paul offered this admonition to his fellow servants , including us : “ Let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us , and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us . ” ​ — Heb .
Regarding foot racing , one of the popular athletic events of the day , the book Backgrounds of Early Christianity tells us that “ the Greeks exercised and competed in the nude . ”
* In such cases , the runners stripped themselves of any extraneous weight or burden that could slow them down .
Paul’s point was that to gain the prize in the race for life , it is essential for runners to remove hindrances of any sort .
What might such weights be ?
Nothing extraordinary .
The real problem was that “ they took no note , ” as Jesus said .
Especially in economically challenging times , it is easy to become anxious about life’s necessities .
As dedicated Christians , we also have important theocratic responsibilities .
We share in the ministry , prepare for and attend Christian meetings , and keep spiritually strong by personal study and family worship .
We should keep in mind what counsel of Jesus ?
This implies that our heavenly Father , Jehovah , will do his part to take care of our needs .
To be sure , “ all these things ” may be different from what we personally are inclined to like or want .
Why ?
In addition to “ every weight , ” Paul mentioned putting off “ the sin that easily entangles us . ”
What might that be ?
How might a Christian become entangled , with the result that his faith is weakened ?
When a runner’s legs get entangled with his garment , almost unavoidably he falls .
What lesson can we draw from Paul’s counsel ?
13 : 3 - 9 .
We might be sidetracked by the glitter and glamour of the entertainment world or by the endless parade of new gadgets .
Jesus is the perfect lead runner , you might say .
“ You May Attain It ” ​ — How ?
How did Paul view his personal share in the race ?
For Paul , all his efforts and hard work in connection with the good news would amount to nothing if he should somehow fail to finish the course .
( Read Philippians 3 : 12 , 13 . )
What encouragement did Paul give his fellow runners in the race ?
He continued : “ That I may have cause for exultation in Christ’s day , that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain . ”
Why should we have the goal , or prize , clearly in view ?
How did he have the faith and strength to do so ?
10 : 24 .
We are near the end of our race . The finish line is as good as in sight .
This was offensive to the Jews of ancient times .
Do You Remember ?
“ Jehovah knows those who belong to him . ” ​ — 2 TIM .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What was Jesus concerned about ?
Many today claim to love God .
Consider : Why are you reading this journal ?
For example , just prior to the statement found at 2 Timothy 2 : 19 , the apostle Paul mentioned Hymenaeus and Philetus .
Those two men had evidently belonged to Jehovah at one point , but they later deviated from the truth .
Recall , too , that in the Galatian congregations , some who had been known by God did not remain in the spiritual light they once enjoyed .
( b ) What examples will we consider ?
Faith and humility distinguished some who were known by God .
In fact , he is called “ the father of all those having faith . ”
In faith , Abraham left his home , his friends , and his possessions to go to a distant land .
Abraham’s faith was still strong many years later .
Abraham demonstrated faith in Jehovah’s promises , so God viewed him as special ; he really knew Abraham .
( Read Genesis 18 : 19 . )
What appropriate desires do some long to see fulfilled ?
For many , though , one or more of those desires may go unfulfilled .
That would be to one’s spiritual detriment .
What if Abraham had taken matters into his own hands to settle down again and make a celebrated name for himself rather than wait on Jehovah ?
What desires do you long to see fulfilled ?
11 : 6 .
A Contrast Between Humility and Pride
Moses and Korah stand in sharp contrast when it comes to demonstrating respect for Jehovah’s arrangement and his decisions .
Their reactions had a bearing on how Jehovah viewed them .
Korah was a Kohathite Levite , and he enjoyed many privileges , which likely included seeing the deliverance of the nation through the Red Sea , supporting Jehovah’s judgment against disobedient Israelites at Mount Sinai , and having a role in transporting the ark of the covenant .
He had evidently been loyal to Jehovah for years and was subsequently looked up to by many in the camp of Israel .
When he gives many details , he does so for good reason .
Rather , Moses made sure that the workers “ did just so ” in following God’s directions .
How we react to adjustments in the worldwide Christian congregation and decisions made by those taking the lead in it has a bearing on our being known by Jehovah .
Korah and his associates alienated themselves from God by their overconfidence , pride , and lack of faith .
Korah lost sight of that fact and consequently failed to show loyalty to those whom God was using .
So in the end , Korah destroyed his record of faithful service by his prideful actions !
Waiting on Jehovah and following directions from those appointed to take the lead requires humility .
Do we show that we are as humble and mild - tempered as Moses was ?
Can we acknowledge the position of those taking the lead among us and submit to directions we receive ?
Abraham and Moses were imperfect and had flaws , as we do .
Being known by Jehovah is undeniably a precious privilege that brings satisfaction to our life now , and it holds out wonderful blessings for the future . ​ — Ps .
Do You Recall ?
• What precious standing can you enjoy with Jehovah ?
[ Picture on page 26 ]
Are you known by Jehovah as one who humbly submits to directions ?
The Scriptures , written under the influence of the same active force that appoints elders , provide living examples of overseers who faced trials successfully .
“ He at Once Got Up ”
And the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods . ”
Likewise , it takes loyalty to discontinue association with a friend or relative who is disfellowshipped . ​ — 1 Cor .
Insight Averts a Crisis
Phinehas ’ courage was not mere youthful impetuousness .
22 : 13 - 34 .
If a Christian hears an accusation or a negative report about a fellow servant of Jehovah , how wise it would be to imitate Phinehas !
A sister once approached me about a personal problem regarding the way a responsible brother in another congregation had treated her .
However , his success in coping with challenges depended on his trusting in Jehovah .
Was Jehovah truly interested in seeing them respond to the wrong that had been done ?
Unwavering in his confidence , Phinehas , now Israel’s high priest , again came to the fore .
“ Shall I go out yet again to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother or shall I cease to ? ” he prayed .
What lesson might we learn from this ?
He objected to all proposals for the site on which the brothers hoped to build .
I was told that it would probably be weeks before we could see the chief officer .
However , we managed to meet with him for five minutes .
After he saw the redrawn plans , he quickly gave us permission to continue , and from then on the local planning officer went out of his way to help us .
That experience impressed on us the power of prayer . ”
Some 1,000 years later , Ezra was inspired to write : “ It was Phinehas the son of Eleazar that happened to be leader over them in the past .
Read what she has to say .
YEAR BORN : 1986
MY PAST : I grew up in Bertrange , a clean , safe , and prosperous little town near the city of Luxembourg .
I am the youngest of five children .
My parents did everything they could to guide me in the right direction , but I rejected their help .
I knew that my lifestyle was not suitable for a Witness , but initially , I felt that what I did with my life was a personal matter .
From studying the Bible , however , I realized that my conduct affects Jehovah’s feelings .
For example , I learned of numerous Bible prophecies that have come true ​ — with an amazing degree of accuracy .
About a year after I started studying the Bible , my parents and I visited my older brother who was a volunteer at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany .
When I saw how happy my brother was , I felt deeply moved .
That happiness was exactly what I had been looking for !
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : I now have a real purpose in life .
[ Blurb on page 12 ]
“ We partied a lot , slept around , and abused drugs and alcohol ”
JEHOVAH GOD has put within our reach a priceless treasure , and it is his heart’s desire that we find it .
How can you find happiness in life ?
This treasure is , in effect , buried in the Bible .
Solomon explains what we need to do in order to find “ the very knowledge of God . ”
The words “ call out , ” “ keep seeking , ” and “ keep searching ” indicate that we need to expend ourselves , earnestly showing our initiative .
If we show such initiative , Jehovah will do the rest .
Suggested Bible reading for October :
Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide offer a free home Bible study to those who want to understand the Bible .
Why is marriage vital to family happiness ?
Husbands and wives should love and respect each other .
He gives you the best advice on how to enjoy your youth .
He wants you to benefit from the wisdom and experience of your parents .
Jehovah appreciates anything you do to praise him . ​ — Read Ecclesiastes 11 : 9 – 12 : 1 ; Matthew 19 : 13 - 15 ; 21 : 15 , 16 .
But in order for your children to find happiness , you also need to teach them to love God and to learn from him .
They also need correction and discipline .

Look in the Bible at Acts chapter 20 , verses 7 to 12 , and see what happened .
What can we learn about God from what happened to Eutychus ? — One thing is that Jehovah , our heavenly Father , can bring the dead back to life , including young ones .
He also resurrected young people , including a 12 - year - old girl .

3 “ Keep on the Watch ” ​ — Why So Important ?
18 Serving Jehovah Has Been My Delight
[ Picture Credit Line on page 2 ]
“ Keep on the Watch ” ​ — Why So Important ?
In answer to that question , Jesus gave his disciples a sign that was clear , detailed , recognizable , and unmistakable , as recorded in Matthew chapter 24 , Mark chapter 13 , and Luke chapter 21 .
He might then reason that the “ great tribulation , ” the culmination of Jesus ’ prophecy , was still quite distant and that it was therefore not yet necessary to “ keep on the watch . ” ​ — Matt .
“ They Took No Note ”
For example , speed - limit signs send out an unmistakable message , yet many disregard them .
Arielle enjoyed watching women’s handball on television .
What followed ?
She explains : “ Some of my teammates had boyfriends who used drugs and smoked .
During Christian meetings , my thoughts often wandered from the Kingdom Hall to the handball court .
Stress built up .
I even sacrificed friendships for handball .
“ The climax came when our opponents were awarded a penalty shot in one game .
Before I realized it , I had prayed to Jehovah to help me block the shot !
“ I had seen our DVD Young People Ask ​ — What Will I Do With My Life ?
My competitive spirit and the accompanying stress disappeared .
Benefit fully from Christian meetings by preparing well and taking notes .
Millions live in areas hard hit by pestilences , food shortages , earthquakes , and other foretold events .
If you have never personally experienced some aspects of the sign , should you reason that the great tribulation is still a long way off ?
Reflect , for example , on what Jesus foretold about “ pestilences and food shortages . ”
The progression of events on earth will not alter this date .
Jesus admonished Christians everywhere : “ Prove yourselves ready . ”
Daily spiritual discussions help Emmanuel and his family to ‘ prove themselves ready ’
Let Us Rejoice Together !
There are many reasons for us to be joyful and to rejoice together .
Rejoice With Fellow Believers
1 : 18 .
Rather , they needed to imitate his example .
The Philippians , moreover , could continue mentioning Paul in their prayers and providing him with whatever help and support they could . ​ — Phil .
1 : 19 ; 4 : 14 - 16 .
Do we strive to see the positive aspects of our circumstances in life and of our Christian ministry ?
Perhaps we had a good conversation with a householder about a selected Bible verse .
Then let us show our gratefulness for these dear “ fellow workers for the kingdom of God . ”
Rejoice With Those Facing Trials
Enduring persecution and overcoming trials strengthened Paul’s determination to stay faithful to Jehovah .
Knowing that the brothers in Philippi would likely face similar trials and would be encouraged by his perseverance gave him reason to be glad and to rejoice with them .
It might come in the form of false accusations from apostates , hostility from family members , ridicule from colleagues or schoolmates .
Jesus warned that these trials should neither surprise us nor discourage us .
We can take an interest in them and support them .
4 : 4 .
“ Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord . ” ​ — EPH .
1 , 2 . ( a ) How does God’s Word indicate that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life ?
There is , therefore , no reason to feel guilty when we once in a while schedule some time to “ observe intently the birds of heaven ” and “ the lilies of the field ” or to enjoy some other activities that refresh us and enrich our life .
Viewing leisure time as part of that gift will move us to use it in a way that will bring pleasure to the Giver .
Why is it reasonable to allow for diversity in recreation ?
Still , we accept that in such matters as food and recreation , there is room for diversity and personal preference . ​ — Rom .
Though we may be willing to eat a variety of foods , we would not deliberately consume food that is rotten .
For recreation to benefit us and be pleasing in Jehovah’s eyes , it needs to meet specific standards set out in God’s Word .
As you seek the answer , it is useful to keep in mind that there are basically two categories of entertainment .
For instance , you may like sports , and that attraction is easily understood .
When Do I Pursue It ?
What is revealed by our answer to the question , ‘ When will I engage in recreation ? ’
reflects our priorities ​ — what we find important and what we find unimportant .
How do Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 6 : 33 help us in deciding how much time to spend on recreation ?
He did not tell us to ‘ keep on seeking only the kingdom . ’
If we do that , limited recreation can be beneficial .
We need to determine how much of our time a certain leisure activity will cost .
Who Are My Companions ?
Why should we carefully consider with whom we share in recreation ?
The third question to ask yourself is , Who ? ​ — that is , ‘ Who are the ones I want to share my leisure activities with ? ’
Following Jesus ’ example in choosing companions will be very helpful .
Ask yourself such questions as : ‘ Does this individual demonstrate in words and deeds that he is obeying the commands of Jehovah and Jesus ?
What do we need to determine regarding our entertainment ?
When it comes to quality , we want to know : ‘ What does it include ?
And concerning company , we need to determine : ‘ With whom will I share in entertainment ?

FEW aspects of life cause more elation , frustration , or worry than our dealings with the opposite sex .
Another may want to get married but has not yet found a suitable mate .
They may drop hints about an eligible member of the opposite sex .
These actions sometimes lead to embarrassment , broken friendships , and hurt feelings .
Individual Christians today also have the right to decide for themselves whether to get married or to stay single .
5 , 6 .
A single Christian often has the flexibility to accept assignments in Jehovah’s service that might be out of reach for a married person .
They reported : “ There is no radio or TV , so the people are not distracted from their main pastime , which is reading . ”
Some villagers showed the pioneers copies of publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses that they were still reading but that were long out of print .
Because the sisters found interest at almost every door , they had difficulty calling on every household in the territory .
I know that Jehovah excludes no one , single or married , from his tender affections . ”
She now happily serves in a land where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers .
If that happens to you , remember that the heartache that results from making a bad choice in a marriage mate can cause greater pain by far than the longing that a person feels while single .
Do not out of desperation make a decision to marry that you will later regret . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 39 .
13 - 15 .
Many newlyweds are surprised , even disappointed , when their mates differ with them on important issues .
A couple do well to resolve areas of concern before they marry .
The pressure caused by family difficulties should not push the two apart .
( Read . )
Married people are by necessity “ anxious for the things of the world , ” such as food , clothing , shelter , and other nonspiritual matters .
But as a husband , he finds that he must use some of that time and energy to care for his wife and thus gain her approval .
What adjustments regarding social activities may some have to make after marriage ?
If a couple must divert some time and energy from God’s service to care for each other , should they not do likewise with resources formerly used for socializing as single people ?
[ Footnote ]
Trust in Jehovah , “ the God of All Comfort ”
“ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort . ” ​ — 2 COR .
Yes , “ the eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones , and his ears are toward their cry for help . ”
The psalmist David made that clear when he sang : “ Jehovah will become a secure height for anyone crushed , a secure height in times of distress . And those knowing your name will trust in you , for you will certainly not leave those looking for you , O Jehovah . ” ​ — Ps .
9 : 9 , 10 .
How did Jesus illustrate Jehovah’s love for His people ?
Jehovah’s worshippers are precious to him .
Through the prophet Jeremiah , Jehovah told His ancient people : “ With a love to time indefinite I have loved you .
We should therefore have the same trust in God as that expressed by Joshua , who declared : “ Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed .
They have all come true for you .
Not one word of them has failed . ” Moreover , we can be certain that even if we are temporarily crushed by trying situations , “ God is faithful ” and will never forsake his loyal servants . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 13 .
How is it possible for us to comfort others ?
The apostle Paul refers to Jehovah as “ the God of all comfort . ”
We can do so “ through the comfort with which we ourselves are being comforted by God . ”
Coping With the Causes of Distress
For example , consider the heart .
Even in severe situations , God can bring relief to a stricken heart if we pray to him in full faith and observe his commandments . ​ — Read 1 John 3 : 19 - 22 ; 5 : 14 , 15 .
How can we cope with emotional distress ?
Distressing events can have a negative effect on our physical health .
Describe Jehovah’s comforting attitude toward Abraham .
That faithful patriarch asked God : “ Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked ? ”
She became pregnant and brought a son to birth , naming him Samuel . ​ — 1 Sam .
Inasmuch as Jehovah “ sees what the heart is , ” when he selected David to be a future king of Israel , he knew that David was sincere and devoted to true worship .
David was truly repentant , and Jehovah forgave him .
God permitted these tests of faith , and Jesus maintained his integrity as a perfect man who always trusted in Jehovah and upheld His sovereignty .
When about to be betrayed and executed , Jesus prayed to Jehovah : “ Let , not my will , but yours take place . ”
Furthermore , we are comforted by the hope of the resurrection .
Confidence in Jehovah’s resurrection promise brings us comfort and a sure hope during times of persecution .
How comforting it is to know that our loved ones now asleep in mankind’s common grave have the prospect of resuming life in a wonderful new world free of all the present - day causes of distress !
Underneath Are God’s Eternal Arms

He will always give us the support we need .
Their experiences prove that in times of trial , Jehovah does indeed comfort his servants .
For example , one of our brothers in the former Soviet Union was sentenced to 23 years in prison because of his faith .

▪ spiritual health Ps .
5 : 14 , 15
What did Jesus do for mourning ones , and why ?
JESUS CHRIST said : “ My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work . ”
Jesus demonstrated such love when he did what was foretold in Isaiah’s prophecy .
During his entire ministry , Jesus lovingly comforted mourning ones , bringing them encouragement and peace of mind .
Conditions throughout the earth continue to deteriorate because Satan now has great anger , knowing he has only a short period of time left before Jehovah takes him out of the way .
How comforting it is to know that God’s toleration of Satan and his evil system will soon end , and the issue Satan raised regarding Jehovah’s sovereignty will be settled ! ​ — Gen . , chap .
During this difficult period of human history , what Jesus foretold is being fulfilled .
Meanwhile , as we face foretold persecution , our integrity to Jehovah is at stake as supporters of his universal sovereignty .
What Scriptural evidence is there that Jehovah comforts his servants ?
Of course , elders and others can and should “ speak consolingly to the depressed souls ” among us .
13 , 14 .
Knowing the truth about God’s purposes and having a genuine hope for the future will certainly provide great comfort .
• What Scriptural proof is there that Jehovah comforts his people ?
Be patient in searching for the specific answer or direction that you need .
And never forget to pray to Jehovah specifically about your concerns and ask him to guide your thinking by means of his holy spirit , “ for Jehovah himself gives wisdom . . . and discernment . ” ​ — Prov .
I GREW UP on my grandfather’s cotton farm in the state of Georgia , U.S.A . , during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
Grandfather’s older daughters managed the household .
The Visit That Changed My Life
One afternoon in 1941 , when I was 15 , an elderly man and his wife came to our home .
However , my aunt Mary , only three years older than me , accepted a Bible along with publications that helped to explain it .
She also experienced what Jesus had foretold , namely : “ A man’s enemies will be persons of his own household . ”
The charge was peddling without a license .
In addition to speaking to me about her newfound beliefs , Mary began witnessing to the neighbors .
Although I did not want to be quickly drawn into anything religious , what I was learning appealed to me .
My outrage was met with the condescending response of an aunt , “ You will thank us later in life for what we have done . ”
By then , I was thrilled to have learned that not only does God have a name , Jehovah , but he is a loving , compassionate God , not one who burns people in a fiery hell .
On a Friday evening in October 1943 , I put some necessities in a box and tied it in a tree some distance from home .
Spiritual Growth , Baptism , Bethel
While living in Edna’s home , I attended meetings regularly and received training in the ministry .
On June 14 , 1944 , I was baptized .
He informed me that I was being assigned to the Service Department .
My hope is that he is in Jehovah’s memory , and if so , at resurrection time he will be , not where he thought he would be , but here on the earth with the hope of living forever in the restored Paradise .
The international ones at New York’s Yankee Stadium in the 1950 ’ s were especially so .
Would you rush over and give them a good talk based on what you think about on the way ? ”
As the number of congregations increased dramatically in New York City in the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s , rented facilities for Kingdom Halls became inadequate .
I was chairman of the building committees for these projects and have many pleasant memories of how Jehovah richly blessed the congregations involved in working together to finance and complete these buildings that continue to serve so well as centers of true worship .
She did not have an umbrella , so I offered to share mine .
Since 1996 , Marjorie and I have been serving at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson , New York , located about 70 miles ( 110 km ) north of Brooklyn .
Challenges of Old Age
I have battled cancer for more than ten years .
She was always a good student of the Bible and a fine teacher of it , and many spiritual children keep in touch with us .
I am very grateful to her for the part she played in helping me to learn the truth of God’s Word and to become like her , a servant of our loving God , Jehovah .

WHAT motivated a gambler and burglar to break his addiction and change his lifestyle ?

“ I Was Passionate About Racehorses . ” ​ — RICHARD STEWART
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : JAMAICA
MY PAST : I grew up in a poor , densely populated area of Kingston , the capital of Jamaica .
Gangs kept people living in fear .
My hardworking mother gave her all for me and my younger brother and sister .
I smoked marijuana and committed robberies to pay for my lifestyle .
I owned many guns , but I am thankful now that nobody was killed as a result of the countless robberies in which I took part .
Although I had an innocent - looking face , I was strong - willed , irritable , and cruel .
I cared for no one but myself .
I decided to find out what made my mother change , so I began discussing the Bible with the Witnesses .
They were the only group I knew of who preached from house to house , as the early Christians did .
They were shocked .
At times , I look back at what I used to be like and can’t believe the changes that I’ve been able to make with God’s help .
I no longer crave the immoral , materialistic lifestyle I used to lead .
It gives me great joy to serve Jehovah God along with my supportive wife and obedient daughter .
I am thankful to Jehovah for allowing me to be part of a loving Christian brotherhood .
“ I learned that Jehovah has feelings and that my actions could either hurt him or make him happy ”
Frederick * : “ When we were first married , I insisted that my wife and I study the Bible together .
I was determined that she concentrate during our study sessions .
WHAT , do you think , was the problem with Frederick and Leanne’s relationship ?
They may have been studying together , but they were not cultivating spirituality as a couple .
By contrast , those with a spiritual attitude value God’s standards .
Consider this illustration : Two gardeners jointly own a garden plot and want to grow vegetables .
One wants to use a particular type of fertilizer , but the other disagrees strongly and feels that the plants do not need any help .
If just one partner cultivates spirituality , the relationship might improve .
Consider two challenges you may face and how you might overcome them .
Sue’s husband , Ed , says : “ I’ve found that when Sue and I regularly discuss spiritual matters together , we cope more effectively with the problems we face and we manage our anxieties better . ”
In addition to talking to each other , it is vital that you spend a few minutes each day praying together .
Instead , when you pray together , mention only those issues that you need to work on together .

His wife , Natalie , says : “ I love to read , and I love to talk about what I’ve learned .
Discuss contentious marital issues at another time , not during your study sessions .
Not likely .
You would ruin everyone’s appetite .
As I see Frederick making an effort to improve in showing Christian qualities , it makes it easier for me to love him . ”
Jehovah allows us to drink alcohol but only in moderation . ​ — Read Psalm 104 : 15 ; 1 Corinthians 6 : 10 .
On the other hand , sex outside of marriage often results in disease , divorce , violence , emotional trauma , and one - parent families . ​ — Read Proverbs 5 : 1 - 9 .
For more information , see chapters 12 and 13 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ DADDY , how do you know so much ? ”
But if your son went a step further ​ — if he applied your wise counsel and reaped the benefit — ​ your heart no doubt glowed with even greater joy .
Or does it seem that as he grows , his regard for you shrinks ?
First , let us consider some of the challenges fathers face .
How so ?
George , for example , was brought up in an African country .
And when can you find time to spend with him ?
Give your boy a small broom or a tiny spade .
It may take you a little longer to finish the chore ; but you will strengthen the bond between you , and you will be teaching him a good work ethic .
Long ago , the Bible encouraged fathers to include their children in their daily activities and to use those occasions to communicate with them and to teach them .
“ It is through play , ” says researcher Michel Fize , “ that a boy communicates best with his father . ”
During playtime , a father can express affection for his son by both words and actions .
I hugged him , and he learned to return my love . ”
If your son appears to be evading your questions , do not conclude that he is closed to any conversation .
“ After our physical exercise , ” says Jacques , “ we used to sit on the grass and rest a bit .
What if your son does not like sports ?
André fondly remembers the hours he spent gazing at the stars with his son .
“ We would set up deck chairs in the cold night air , ” says André .
“ Then we would wrap ourselves up warmly and , with a cup of tea in hand , observe the night sky .
“ I was far more interested in sports than my son Vaughan was , ” says Ian , who lives in South Africa .
I feel that because we shared enjoyable activities together , Vaughan was able to speak more freely with me . ”
When he succeeds , I commend him .
Or what if his goals , though not bad , are different from ones that you would choose for him ?

21 Questions From Readers
Cynthia feels that she will be the next to be let go .
A young man named Samuel has a concern of another sort .
Now in his 20 ’ s , Samuel has a strong temptation to go back to that habit .
How can he resist the pull ?
Lynn’s background made it difficult for her to trust anyone fully .
When in Distress
Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help .
How comforting it is to know that no matter how dire our situation is , we can call out to Jehovah with a “ request for favor ” ! ​ — Read Psalm 55 : 1 , 16 .
The examples of Hezekiah , Hannah , and Jonah also teach us a vital lesson about what we should not fail to remember as we pray while under duress .
God’s name , his worship , and the doing of his will were matters of utmost importance to them .
What did Jehoshaphat do when confronted with a situation that he did not know how to handle ?
Judah was in no position to take a stand against them .
The true God heard Jehoshaphat’s prayer and provided a miraculous deliverance .
David again inquired of Jehovah and received a clear answer .
What lesson can we draw from the way that Joshua and the older men of Israel dealt with the Gibeonites ?
Being imperfect , all of us ​ — even experienced elders — ​ need to be on guard against failing to look to Jehovah for direction when making decisions .
Consider how Moses ’ successor , Joshua , and the older men of Israel responded when approached by shrewd Gibeonites who disguised themselves and pretended to have come from a distant land .
Without inquiring of Jehovah , Joshua and others went ahead and made peace with the Gibeonites , concluding a covenant with them .
( Read Luke 22 : 40 . )
We are assured that “ he gives generously to all and without reproaching . ”
Let him call the older men of the congregation to him , and let them pray over him , greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah . And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well . ” ​ — Jas .
18 , 19 . ( a ) Why can resisting temptation be challenging , but how can you meet the challenge successfully ?
( b ) What is your determination ?
• What did you learn from Hezekiah , Hannah , and Jonah about trusting in Jehovah ?
• How do the examples of David and Joshua emphasize the need for caution when making decisions ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What serious situation has resulted from a person’s being distracted while driving ?
That was the assessment of the U.S . secretary of transportation .
If we allow ourselves to drift away from our Christian course and theocratic activities , the result could be the shipwreck of our faith .
As a descendant of Adam , Paul was subject to the effects of sin on the imperfect flesh .
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! ”
God’s spirit , coupled with their faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice , enables them to come off victorious in the struggle that Paul described and thus “ have no condemnation . ”
They are urged to “ walk , not in accord with the flesh , but in accord with the spirit . ”
What is the meaning of the word “ law ” as used at Romans 8 : 2 ?
In his letter to the Galatians , Paul called such acts and traits “ the works of the flesh . ”
People of this kind are the same as those who walk in accord with the flesh .
Who can say that he has totally freed himself from walking in accord with the flesh ?
Jesus said : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Our situation is similar to being cured of a serious illness .
Though exercising faith in the ransom can free us from the law of sin and of death , we are still imperfect and sinful .
In connection with fulfilling “ the righteous requirement of the Law , ” Paul also brings out the matter of walking in accord with the spirit .
Walk in Accord With the Spirit ​ — How ?
( Read Romans 8 : 5 . )
Read Romans 8 : 6 .
To do anything ​ — whether it is good or bad — ​ one must set one’s mind on it .
People who constantly set their minds on the things of the flesh soon develop a mental attitude or inclination that is totally focused on the things of the flesh .
Their sentiments , interests , and affections usually become completely occupied with such things .
With what things are most people occupied today ?
Thus we will go on walking in accord with the spirit .
6 : 7 , 8 .
• What is “ the law of sin and of death , ” and how can we be freed from it ?
“ In faith all these . . . publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land . ” ​ — HEB .
2 : 11 .
They Lived as “ Temporary Residents ”
2 , 3 .
From earliest times , faithful servants of Jehovah stood out as different from those in the ungodly world in which they lived .
The people of Israel were never to forget that the real Owner of their land was Jehovah .
Why did Jehovah reject Israel , and to what new nation did he transfer his favor ?
This warning was not unfounded .
Jehovah therefore abandoned them to their enemies .
“ No Part of the World ”
Shortly before his death , Jesus told his disciples : “ If you were part of the world , the world would be fond of what is its own .
Maintain your conduct fine among the nations . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
Through their abstention from much of the community life ​ — the pagan festivals , the public amusements which to Christians were shot through and through with pagan beliefs , practices , and immoralities — ​ they were derided as haters of the human race . ”
We do this because we are convinced that Jehovah’s Kingdom government under Christ will shortly put an end to imperfect human rulership , replacing it with a righteous new system of things . ​ — Dan .
10 , 11 . ( a ) How do we make limited use of the world ?
( b ) What are some ways in which vigilant Christians refrain from using the world to the full ?
Vigilant Christians refrain from using the world to the full with regard to higher education .
Many people in this world consider higher education an indispensable stepping - stone to prestige and an affluent life .
By doing so , they can become “ rich toward God . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 21 ; read Matthew 6 : 19 - 21 .
Jehovah’s servants differ from people of the world in their attitude toward material things .
Our living contentedly as temporary residents in this system of things helps us to avoid falling into this trap .
Instead , it enables us to keep our eye “ simple , ” or “ in focus , ” looking “ all one way ” toward God’s Kingdom and keeping its interests first in our lives . ​ — Matt . 6 : 22 , ftn .
“ The World Is Passing Away ”
A fundamental reason why we as true Christians consider ourselves to be “ aliens and temporary residents ” in this world is our conviction that its days are numbered .
The Israelites were told that if they obeyed Jehovah , they would become his “ special property out of all other peoples . ”
How Would You Answer ?
Those who came that day numbered “ about five thousand men , besides women and young children . ”
Included were “ four thousand men , besides women and young children . ”
Evidently , many men were among the people who came to Jesus and showed interest in his teaching .
Although Jesus did not develop a special ministry to seek out men , he certainly addressed issues that concerned the men of his day .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What is a major concern for many men ?
The uncertainty of where his next meal would come from or where he would live apparently did not sit well with the scribe , for there is no indication that he became a follower of Christ . ​ — Matt .
According to their way of thinking , the reward of making money is more urgent and practical than any benefits that might come from studying the Scriptures and seeking a close relationship with God .
Andrew and his brother Simon Peter were partners in a fishing business .
How did the two respond ?
What helped these men take up the full - time ministry ?
How can we assist the student to see that Jehovah is good ?
Suppose a student who has financial worries is also trying to overcome a bad habit , such as smoking , gambling , or heavy drinking .
Fear of Popular Opinion
( b ) Why do some men today hesitate to follow Christ ?
Because of peer pressure , some men may hesitate to follow Christ fully .
Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea kept their interest in Jesus secret because they were afraid of what other Jews might say or do if they found out .
For example , a man in Germany admitted : “ What you Witnesses preach about the Bible is true .
How did Jesus help his disciples to cope with fear of man ?
Moreover , Jesus invited new ones to associate freely with his disciples and make friends with them . ​ — Mark 10 : 29 , 30 .
Feelings of Inadequacy
Some men are uncomfortable sharing their views or feelings in a public setting .
The thought of having to study , comment at Christian meetings , or share their faith with others may seem overwhelming to them .
Why could Jesus ’ disciples not heal a demon - possessed boy ?
Failure to succeed will result in a lack of confidence .
How may we be able to help a Bible student to overcome feelings of inadequacy ?
( b ) What will we study next ?
Let us witness informally to male workmates when appropriate and reach out to unbelieving husbands in the congregation .
[ Footnote ]
[ Picture on page 26 ]
Mere secular education or life experience does not prepare a man for this kind of work .
By no means do elders treat as inferior a ministerial servant who may be comparatively young .
However , Jesus did not lecture or threaten his disciples .
Jesus ’ example had a positive influence on his apostles .
Moreover , elders who are exemplary in faith , in teaching , in Christian living , and in the ministry experience the satisfaction of knowing that others can imitate their faith . ​ — Heb .
After zealously engaging in his ministry for about two years , Jesus expanded the preaching activity by sending out his 12 apostles to preach .
10 , 11 .
Our assistance continues as we conduct Bible studies with him .
“ The One Listening to Counsel Is Wise ”
Jesus also recognized the limitations of his followers and did not expect perfection from them .
( b ) Give examples of what personal counsel an elder may offer to someone who is not progressing spiritually .
Every man who reaches out for responsibility in the Christian congregation needs counsel or Scriptural advice at one time or another .
If elders observe that some questionable conduct is retarding a man’s spiritual progress , they take the initiative to readjust him in a spirit of mildness .
The elders take the lead in training men to reach out , but others can support their efforts .
For instance , a man’s family can and should help him to reach out .
Their self - sacrificing spirit brings him joy and is greatly appreciated by others . ​ — Prov .
( a ) The primary responsibility to reach out rests with whom ?
Although others can help and support him , the primary responsibility for reaching out rests with the man himself .
( Read Galatians 6 : 5 . )
This calls for regular Bible reading , diligent personal study , serious meditation , heartfelt prayer , and zealous participation in the Christian ministry .
Reflecting on such points may move a brother to put forth effort to overcome negative feelings .
• How can elders imitate Jesus as they help men in the congregation to take the lead ?
• What can a man himself do to reach out for privileges ?

Consequently , the length of the daylight period varied , according to the season .
Hence , references to time were approximate .
True , John included a time that appears to vary from that given by Mark .
Paul testified that this was really “ beyond their actual ability . ”
Some ten years after the Philippians first embraced Christianity , they were still displaying the same generous spirit .

Jehu manifested qualities that we would do well to imitate .
The country was under the wicked influence of Jezebel , widow of Ahab and mother of the ruling king , Jehoram .
The prophet Elisha sent one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu as king and to instruct him to kill every male of the apostate house of Ahab . ​ — 2 Ki .
But when pressed , he told them the truth , and he and his companions began to conspire against Jehoram .
Likely , there had been underlying resentment and resistance to the policies of the ruling house and to Jezebel’s influence .
King Jehoram had been wounded in battle and had withdrawn to the city of Jezreel , hoping to recuperate .
“ Do not let anyone go out in escape from the city to go and make report in Jezreel , ” said Jehu .
Without wasting words , Jehu commanded the court officials to throw Jezebel down from the window .
9 : 30 - 34 ; 10 : 1 - 14 .
Today , no servant of Jehovah uses physical force against opponents of pure worship .
And all members of the congregation need to be determined to avoid the company of disfellowshipped individuals . ​ — 2 John 9 - 11 .
“ This is a clever play on words on the part of Jehu , ” says one scholar .
While the term employed here “ generally means ‘ sacrifice , ’ it is also used of the ‘ slaughter ’ of apostates . ”
“ Gentler measures probably would have failed to eradicate Baal worship from Israel . ”
We should be prompt , courageous , and dynamic in rejecting it .
When it comes to our godly devotion , we cannot tolerate any rivalry toward Jehovah .
Jehu may have believed that the independence of the kingdom of Israel from Judah required the religious separation of the two kingdoms .
Hence , like former kings of Israel , he attempted to keep them separate by perpetuating calf worship .
The accompanying inscription reads : “ The tribute of Jehu ( Ia - ú - a ) , son of Omri ( Hu - um - ri ) ; I received from him silver , gold , a golden saplu - bowl , a golden vase with pointed bottom , golden tumblers , golden buckets , tin , a staff for a king , ( and ) wooden puruhtu [ the meaning of the latter word being unknown ] . ”
As told by Sara van der Monde
People often tell me , “ Sara , you have such a lovely smile .
My birth was difficult , and later I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy . I had limited limb movement , and my speech was hard to understand .
That was the first time that I recall feeling close to God .
Coping With Setbacks
She even offered to help me find accommodations .
Not long after the episode with my teacher , I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Over the years , I have faced other tests of faith .
At first , I was flattered .
“ I think [ it ] is tembatsu ( divine punishment ) , although I feel sorry for disaster victims , ” said a leading Japanese politician after that country was hit by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and a tsunami in March 2011 .
A newspaper there reported that “ twenty - one percent of adults believe God is unleashing his wrath with landslides , typhoons and other disasters ” that frequently pummel the country .
THE belief that God brings about disasters to punish bad people is not new .
In their rush to blame God , some point to Bible accounts where God brought destruction by natural elements .
Although people often label such disasters as “ acts of God , ” this is really a misnomer .
Those natural disasters , therefore , have great significance for us .
Hence , it is no surprise that the Devil has created a global system that thrives on those and other ungodly traits .
A United Nations report on global disasters states : “ Populations are too often being concentrated in risky areas such as flood plains .
Though much of this “ human activity ” is said to be for economic progress , it is in reality the work of the selfish and greedy spirit that permeates the world .
We see , then , that many disasters are the result of careless human activity .
In many parts of the world , the effects of natural disasters have been greatly aggravated by the underhanded dealings of unscrupulous individuals or by the fact that masses of people have been forced to live in hazardous areas as a result of the economic or social inequalities inherent in the world today .
“ Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself , but the inexperienced have passed along and must suffer the penalty , ” says the Bible .
In spite of all precautions taken , you may still find yourself a victim of an unexpected tragedy .
Another verse describes him as the God “ who comforts those laid low . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 ; 7 : 6 .
Yes , God is keenly aware of the circumstances coming upon those who put faith in him .
Prayers , not for miracles but for God’s powerful holy spirit , can provide help in any situation .
They lovingly responded by providing relief supplies .
Or you might just think to yourself , ‘ Whom does he think he’s kidding ? ’
Even though natural disasters seem to be here to stay , there is a basis for real hope that this will change .
The change , however , will not come through human efforts .
Since God made the earth and all its elements , logically he knows how to manage things so that people can dwell on it in peace and security . ​ — Psalm 37 : 11 ; 115 : 16 .
How , then , will God bring about the needed change ?
Though Jehovah God has the power to do this himself , he has chosen to delegate the task to his Son .
His disciples panicked .
Since then , Jesus has been elevated to the spirit realm and has been given even greater power and authority .
As the King of God’s Kingdom , he has the responsibility as well as the ability to administer all the changes necessary to give people a peaceful and secure life on earth .
The Bible speaks of the Lord Jesus coming “ from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire , as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus . ”
Yes , he will “ bring to ruin those ruining the earth . ” ​ — 2 Thessalonians 1 : 7 , 8 ; Revelation 11 : 18 .
Since “ those who do not know God ” and “ those who do not obey the good news ” will not qualify to live in the disaster - free world to come , it is clear that one must now learn about God and support his arrangement for rulership of the earth .
God requires that we come to know him and obey the good news of the Kingdom that he has set up through his Son .
The best way to learn to do this is through a careful study of the Bible .
Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to help you learn what the Bible teaches ?
One thing is sure ​ — if you make the effort to know God and to obey the good news , then the words of Proverbs 1 : 33 will come true in your case : “ As for the one listening to me , he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity . ”
How Can We Choose Good Friends ?
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in the Bible .
Why should we select friends carefully ?
Most people like to be accepted by others .
So our friends have a powerful influence on the attitudes that develop in our heart .
For example , David enjoyed Jonathan’s friendship because Jonathan encouraged him to trust Jehovah . ​ — Read 1 Samuel 23 : 16 - 18 .
Although Jehovah is almighty , we can actually become his friends .
For example , Abraham became a friend of God .
True friends are loyal and help you to do what is right .
You can meet people who share your love for what is right at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
However , even friends who love God may sometimes disappoint us .
Maybe you can help them . ​ — Read Colossians 4 : 6 .
IF YOU had to choose a single word to describe Jehovah God ​ — his essence , or nature — ​ what word would you select ?
The Bible plainly states : “ No man has seen God at any time . ”
Through and through , Jehovah is pure , clean , and blameless .
Why ?
His holiness thus guarantees that he will always be the ideal Father , a righteous Ruler , and an impartial Judge .
Insight on the Scriptures explains : “ When a person received a vision from God during waking hours , it appears that the impression was made upon the conscious mind .
The vision could later be recalled and described or recorded by the recipient , in his own words . ” ​ — Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .

Guided by God’s Spirit in the First Century and Today
Some people mentioned in the Bible are good examples for us , but they may also serve as warning examples .
STUDY ARTICLES 3 , 4 PAGES 18 - 26
Many servants of God in the past were filled with holy spirit .
In what ways did God’s spirit operate upon them ?
For centuries , explorers and travelers have used the compass to guide their way over land and sea .
What is it ?
The one described in the opening verses of the Bible .
What was at work ?
104 : 30 .
The Nature of Holy Spirit
4 , 5 . ( a ) What do Trinitarians wrongly think that the holy spirit is ?
Likely , some of the people you talk to in the ministry believe in what the King James Version and some other Bible translations call the Holy Ghost .
It is noteworthy , however , that throughout The Webster Bible , an amended King James Version originally published in 1833 , American lexicographer Noah Webster replaced “ Holy Ghost ” with “ Holy Spirit . ”
Just as wind is invisible but exerts force , so the immaterial , impersonal holy spirit is unseen but produces effects .
Not at all ! ​ — Read Isaiah 40 : 12 , 13 .
He promised the psalmist David : “ I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go . ”
We Are Not Qualified to Guide Ourselves
“ To guide ” means “ to direct in a course or show the way to be followed . ”
Jeremiah heard God’s analysis of why we are impaired when it comes to directing ourselves .
Would it not be foolhardy for an inexperienced person to set off alone , without a skilled guide and not so much as a compass , hiking deep into an uncharted wilderness ?
How will that active force help us ?
Additionally , at any unexpected turn in the road to life , the spirit will show us the way to go .
Jesus Was Guided by God’s Spirit
Jehovah’s words came true .
As a result , Jesus knew what to do in each situation , and he did exactly what his Father wanted him to do .
Why is that so necessary for us ?
What is the world’s spirit , and what does it produce ?
When a person gives in to the world’s spirit and takes up practicing the works of the flesh , grave consequences result , preventing him from inheriting God’s Kingdom . ​ — Gal .
How can we succeed in resisting the spirit of the world ?
Jehovah has equipped us to resist the spirit of the world .
God’s spirit produces in us fine qualities that benefit us and those with whom we live and serve .
We are wise to take stock of ourselves to be sure that our words and actions give evidence that we are directed by holy spirit and are producing its fruitage .
We do this by studying each aspect as it is revealed through the pages of the Bible and discussed in our Christian publications .
* As we observe the results of the operation of God’s spirit in our own life as well as in the lives of our fellow Christians , we clearly see why we must be guided by it .
He welcomed its influence , and when it impelled him , he yielded and acted accordingly .
God’s active force still operates on willing minds and hearts to move and guide them .
( Read Ephesians 3 : 14 - 16 . )
In the preface of his Bible , Webster wrote : “ Whenever words are understood in a sense different from that which they had when introduced , and different from that of the original languages , they do not present to the reader the Word of God . ” For a discussion of each aspect , see the subject “ Fruitage of God’s Spirit ” and the heading “ List by Aspect ” in the Watch Tower Publications Indexes .

God’s spirit operates on minds and hearts to move and guide them
1 , 2 .
Why can we say that Solomon set a good example for us ?
something more than Solomon is here . ”
How did Solomon gain his wisdom , but how is our acquiring of wisdom different ?
Pleased that the king asked for wisdom rather than for riches and glory , God gave Solomon “ a wise and understanding heart ” ​ — as well as prosperity .
10 : 1 , 4 - 9 .
Solomon wrote : “ In that case you will understand righteousness and judgment and uprightness , the entire course of what is good . ” ​ — Prov .
We may call it Solomon’s temple , but it was not his idea or his way to make a name for himself as an architect or a wealthy benefactor .
In part , he prayed to Jehovah : “ [ May your ] eyes . . . prove to be opened toward this house night and day , toward the place of which you said , ‘ My name will prove to be there , ’ to listen to the prayer with which your servant prays toward this place . ”
After celebrating the temple’s inauguration , the people were “ rejoicing and feeling merry of heart over all the goodness that Jehovah had performed for David his servant and for Israel . ”
What failing on Solomon’s part may readily come to mind ?
Why , though , can we say that Solomon’s life course is also a warning example ?
But is that the only warning we find in Solomon’s life ?
According to that verse , upon Solomon’s death his son Rehoboam became king at age 41 , his mother being “ Naamah the Ammonitess . ”
Even if she did at one time , she may have turned away from idols and may have become a true worshipper , as did Rahab and Ruth .
Still , Solomon likely came to have Ammonite in - laws and relatives who did not serve Jehovah .
Did Solomon reason that Egypt was not one of those listed nations ?
Actually , his course ignored the clear risk that Jehovah had mentioned ​ — that of turning an Israelite from true worship to false . ​ — Read Deuteronomy 7 : 1 - 4 .
A sister might attempt to rationalize forming a romantic link that ignores God’s directive to marry “ only in the Lord . ”
How did Jehovah show mercy in dealing with Solomon , but what should we remember about that ?
So Many Wives !
In the Song of Solomon , the king said admiringly of a certain virgin that she was more beautiful than 60 queens and 80 concubines .
Does this suggest that Solomon could ignore God’s direction with impunity or that we can do so ?
Recall what Solomon wrote : “ Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily , that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad . ”
He added : “ I am also aware that it will turn out well with those fearing the true God , because they were in fear of him . ” ​ — Eccl .
8 : 11 , 12 .
We can find some of those in the lives of men and women whom Jehovah at one point accepted and used as his servants .
We can discern that some gradually developed wrong attitudes or tendencies , which eventually produced sad consequences .

Are you benefiting from the warning example involving Solomon ?
48 : 16 .
It is an aspect of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit .
They had doubts , insecurities , and weaknesses but “ were made powerful ” by God’s spirit to face challenges .
God’s Spirit Empowered Moses
( b ) What does Moses ’ example teach us about Jehovah’s giving his spirit ?
Moses had been given holy spirit sufficient for the task .
Are legitimate demands on your time increasing ?
Holy Spirit Made Bezalel Qualified
( c ) Why is Bezalel’s experience particularly encouraging ?
( Read Exodus 35 : 30 - 35 . )
Bezalel was appointed to take the lead in making the necessary furnishings for the tabernacle .
Jehovah “ proceeded to fill him with the spirit of God in wisdom , in understanding and in knowledge and in every sort of craftsmanship and for designing devices . . . to make ingenious products of every sort . ”
Another testimony that Bezalel and Oholiab were guided by God’s spirit is the amazing durability of their work .
Their productions were still in use some 500 years later .
Unlike modern - day manufacturers , Bezalel and Oholiab had no interest in leaving their signature or trademark on their work .
All credit went to Jehovah for their accomplishments . ​ — Ex .
At times , these deeds are performed by skilled workers , but more often they are carried out by volunteers without much background in a specific field .
Have you held back from accepting an assignment in Jehovah’s service , feeling that others were more qualified than you ?
Manna gatherer ?
Later Joshua , “ full of the spirit of wisdom , ” succeeded Moses .
Today , we may feel inexperienced or underqualified to carry out certain aspects of our sacred service .
1 : 7 - 9 .
Had you been part of that little band , would you have felt secure in the knowledge that your company had now been pruned of its fearful and less - than - vigilant ones ?
He did what he was told to do !
Jehovah’s loving promises fortify our faith and convince us that he really is our Helper !
“ Jehovah’s Spirit Now Came Upon Jephthah ”
15 , 16 .
Why did Jephthah’s daughter have a fine attitude , and how is this encouraging to parents ?
Eager for victory to Jehovah’s praise , Jephthah made a vow that proved costly .
( Read Judges 11 : 36 . )
Jehovah’s spirit gave both of them the strength they needed .
No doubt her faith was built up as she observed her father’s zeal and godly devotion .
What did Samson do by means of God’s spirit ?
18 , 19 . ( a ) Samson’s experience provides what assurance for us ?
This assignment calls for skills that may not come naturally .
How grateful we are that Jehovah uses his spirit to enable us to accomplish the wide variety of tasks that we are entrusted with !
God’s spirit can make us as mighty spiritually as Samson was physically
In the preceding article , we considered some of the ways in which God’s spirit enabled faithful ones of old to carry out difficult and detailed assignments .
How had Mary seen the effect of holy spirit ?
Mary was present in that large upper room in Jerusalem when the promised holy spirit was poured out .
Jehovah had transferred his Son’s life from heaven to earth , causing conception in Mary’s womb while she was still a virgin .
Have you at times felt somewhat overwhelmed by challenges or responsibilities in God’s service ?
Each of us does well to ask himself : ‘ Do I completely trust in Jehovah to work matters out in harmony with his will ?
By means of God’s spirit , what could Peter do during and after Pentecost 33 C.E . ?
And he was even empowered to perform a resurrection . ​ — Acts 9 : 40 .
But there were aspects of Jesus ’ teachings that remained unclear to him before Pentecost .
By inspiration , the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures set out ​ — for our benefit — ​ amazing facets of Jehovah’s purpose .
Today , both spirit - anointed ones and those of the “ other sheep ” feed together spiritually , assimilating these same truths .
Paul Became “ Filled With Holy Spirit ”
Paul was able to accomplish what by means of holy spirit ?
That was Saul , who became known as Paul .
What an effect that had on the principal administrator of Cyprus , who was listening to the whole conversation !
How was Paul guided by God’s spirit ?

As he embarked on his missionary journeys , Paul was guided by God’s spirit .
Explain .
Elders , for instance , are appointed by holy spirit .
What are we to conclude from this ?
Revelation 22 : 17 answers : “ The spirit and the bride keep on saying : ‘ Come ! ’
Yet , those of the other sheep join in extending this invitation .
And all of them yield to the action of God’s spirit in their lives , allowing it to produce in them its fruitage .
7 : 9 , 14 .
The precious gift of holy spirit , coupled with our earnest efforts to keep “ a tight grip on the word of life , ” will allow us to “ keep working out [ our ] own salvation with fear and trembling . ” ​ — Phil .
Indeed , keep on supplicating Jehovah that you may be like faithful ones ​ — both ancient and modern — ​ who were guided by God’s holy spirit .
• How are God’s servants guided by God’s spirit today ?
God’s spirit enabled Paul to overcome the influence of wicked spirits
Today , holy spirit is available to aid Christians , whatever their hope
You may even feel like Job , who said : “ I would prefer death to all my sufferings . ”
What if such a condition persists , even for years ?
When Mephibosheth was five years old , he “ had a fall and was lamed . ”
Whatever the case , the problem lingered , and he had to deal with the physical or emotional pain it brought . ​ — 2 Cor .
12 : 9 , 10 .
Because of my newfound limitations , I had to reevaluate everything . ”
All illnesses ​ — including the chronic and the emotional — ​ are a dismal legacy from our first parents , Adam and Eve . ​ — Rom .
Especially at difficult moments in our lives , we come to appreciate that God is ‘ our refuge and our stronghold . ’
Bear in mind , though , that your loved ones also suffer .
Barbara says regarding her daughter and other young sisters in the congregation : “ They support me in the ministry .
Yet , your fellow believers will appreciate your frankness .
Of course , we should not be demanding but be appreciative of their help .
A gloomy disposition and despondent feelings can lead to negative thinking .
I try to enjoy the days when I do feel better .
I also have a wonderful prospect for the future . ”
It teaches me to show insight and good judgment as well as to forgive from the heart .
[ Box / ​ Pictures on pages 28 , 29 ]
“ In addition to doing telephone witnessing , I write letters and regularly correspond with a few interested ones .
While in the hospital , I always put the Bible and publications next to my bed .

As told by James A .
When I was born in the southern United States in 1928 , segregation of whites and blacks was the law .
Mother , who was just 20 years old , died .
In 1940 several in our congregation rented a bus and traveled to the convention held in Detroit , Michigan .
When they asked me about it , I replied , “ I don’t understand all that is involved in baptism . ”
On a very cold day four months later , October 1 , 1940 , I was baptized in a pond outside of Chattanooga .
Although I had money , I could not enter a local store to purchase any more food because I was black .
The congregation there was the first racially mixed one that I attended .
During the early part of the 1950 ’ s , many young men were being drafted to serve in the military and fight in the conflict going on in Korea .
So on January 11 , 1952 , the Presidential Appeal Board granted me a 4 - D classification as a minister .
( 1 ) A brief comment on world conditions .
( 2 ) The remedy the Bible provides .
There I demonstrated that three - point presentation .
Yes , traveling overseers needed to be adaptable .
We were always polite and generally fulfilled our ministry without trouble .
There was another form of prejudice , a regional one , against those from the North .
So I went to the school board and explained that I had gone to school in Chattanooga .
We were then granted permission for our circuit assembly .
Racial tension was heating up in the mid - 1950 ’ s , and sometimes there was violence .
The following summer , I was assigned as a speaker .
This required reassigning publishers to different congregations as well as adjusting congregation territories and the responsibilities of brothers having oversight .
We arrived there in July 1969 .
Some , in time , became pioneers , congregation elders , and even went to Gilead to become missionaries themselves .
In 1983 my parents in the United States needed assistance .
I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995 and had to return to the United States .
We settled in Goldsboro , North Carolina , because it was about halfway between my family in Tennessee and Gerri’s in Pennsylvania .
How true are the words of David : “ With someone loyal [ Jehovah ] will act in loyalty ” ! ​ — 2 Sam .

After attending Gilead , we were assigned to the traveling work in the South
Each of Israel’s other tribes got an allotment of land , but the Levites had Jehovah as their “ share . ”
They would not inherit land , but they received a special privilege of service .
The Jews were released , and they arrived in their homeland by 537 B.C.E .
So Jerusalem must have fallen in 607 B.C.E . ​ — 10 / 1 , pages 26 - 31 .

That passage tells of a young man who walked in an area where an immoral woman was known to live .
She seduced him .

10 Abraham ​ — A Man of Love
22 Did You Know ? 23 Our Readers Ask . . . Why Did God Ask Abraham to Sacrifice His Son ?

Jesus proved to be the Messiah .
The time until his arrival was measured in weeks of years , meaning that each “ week ” was seven years long .
The Bible revealed that in contrast with what might be expected in an age of progress , people would be ruining the earth .
Almighty God has good things in store for faithful mankind .
Jesus Christ , the Messiah , along with his chosen ones , will rule over the earth from heaven .
As we examine those words , let us keep in mind that they also apply to God’s worshippers today . ​ — Romans 15 : 4 .
These are not empty words .
Is that not a comforting thought ?
Jehovah further assures his worshippers , saying : “ Do not gaze about . ”
The Hebrew verb used here can refer to those who “ look about in all directions to see whether there is anything that can harm them . ”
With the all - powerful Jehovah as their God , why should they fear ?
He also says : “ I , Jehovah your God , am grasping your right hand . ”
“ [ The father ] does not merely stand by to defend , but he is also physically with the child ; he will not allow the child to be separated from him . ”
Jehovah is willing to reach out and grasp our hand .

Regarding the study edition , a longtime servant of Jehovah wrote : “ Marvelous and penetrating ​ — that was my impression of the first study edition of The Watchtower .
The deeper spiritual language and statements spoke directly to my heart .
You will note that the margins have been widened a little and that the page and paragraph numbers stand out more .

Who were some champions of God’s Word who lived during the Middle Ages ?
From personal experience , name one important respect in which Jehovah’s Witnesses are different from other religious groups .
Many would reply , ‘ I was impressed by the fact that the Witness used the Bible to answer all my questions . ’
The question was , Should the men be circumcised according to the Jewish custom before presenting themselves for baptism ?
That was not an easy question for a Jew to answer .
Jews who observed the Law would not even enter a Gentile’s home , let alone enjoy warm fellowship with one .
What followed was , not a mind - numbing theological debate over dry technicalities , but a lively doctrinal discussion .
Would personal preferences or prejudices rule the day ?
Would the responsible older men postpone the decision until the religious climate in Israel improved for them ?
6 , 7 .
How were the Scriptures used to settle the circumcision issue ?
As quoted at Acts 15 : 16 , 17 , it reads : “ I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down ; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again , in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah , together with people of all the nations , people who are called by my name , says Jehovah . ”
They did not consider circumcised Gentiles as ‘ people of the nations ’ but as brothers .

Even though the decision would likely expose Jewish Christians to more persecution , faithful ones lent their full support to the Bible - based decision . ​ — Acts 16 : 4 , 5 .
An important doctrine that was given a pagan twist had to do with the identity of Jesus Christ .
The question was debated at a number of church councils .
The issue could have been settled quite easily had the delegates given appropriate weight to the Scriptures , but most did not .
In fact , the majority had made up their minds even before they arrived at the councils , and they left more deeply entrenched than ever in their positions .
Scholar Charles Freeman answers that those who believed that Jesus is God “ found it difficult to refute the many sayings of Jesus that suggested he was subordinate to God the Father . ”
To this day , many of the clergy elevate the uninspired sayings of so - called Church Fathers to a plane higher than the Word of God !
If you have ever discussed the Trinity doctrine with a seminarian , you have likely noticed that .
In less than a year , the new emperor had returned or rebuilt virtually all their churches , given them back the jobs and honors taken from them . . .
Gregory and his associates would have done well to listen to them !
Peter resigned from the priesthood because he could not reconcile with the Scriptures the Catholic teachings of infant baptism , transubstantiation , prayers for the dead , and worship of the cross .
* Unlike Peter of Bruys and Henry of Lausanne , he was a layman , but he valued God’s Word so much that he divested himself of his material goods and arranged for portions of the Bible to be translated into a language commonly spoken in southeastern France .
Try as they might , enemies of Bible truth have been unable to prevent its spread .
In 1870 a group of sincere Bible students began searching for the truth .
Someone would raise a question .
They would discuss it .
Does it not reassure you to know that like the apostles and older men of the first century , those faithful men , our “ spiritual ancestors ” of the late 1800 ’ s , were determined to align their beliefs solidly with God’s Word ?
What is the yeartext for 2012 , and why is it appropriate ?
The Bible is still the foundation for our beliefs .

26 : 38 .
Being vigilant with a view to prayers ?
With much weighing on his mind and heart , Jesus needs to find solitude so that he can pray . ​ — Matt .
Three of the apostles ​ — Peter , James , and John — ​ accompany Jesus to a spot deeper in the garden .
Again he implores them : “ Keep on the watch . ”
26 : 38 , 41 , 56 .
The Bible book of Acts shows that they went on to set an outstanding example in keeping watchful .
WATCHFUL FOR DIRECTION ON WHERE TO PREACH
4 , 5 .
Paul , Silas , and Timothy had left the city of Lystra in southern Galatia .
But something stopped them in their tracks .
6 , 7 . ( a ) What happened to Paul and the other travelers near Bithynia ?
Verse 9 reports what happened next : “ During the night a vision appeared to Paul : a certain Macedonian man was standing and entreating him and saying : ‘ Step over into Macedonia and help us . ’ ”
What can we learn from this account ?
As Head of the congregation , Jesus may deal with us in a similar way .
Likewise , Jesus may direct us in expanding our ministry but only if we are moving ​ — if we are putting forth effort to reach our goal .
Recall that in the garden of Gethsemane just before his arrest , Jesus told three of his apostles : “ Keep on the watch and pray continually . ” ​ — Matt .
In the opening verses of this account , we learn that in order to win favor with the Jews , Herod mistreated the Christians .
Hence , Herod had James killed “ by the sword . ”
5 : 16 .
65 : 2 .
15 , 16 . ( a ) Describe how Jehovah’s angel delivered Peter from prison .
( Read Acts 12 : 7 - 11 . )
An angel stood there , evidently unseen by the guards , and urgently woke Peter up .
And those chains binding his hands simply fell off !
Our faith in God’s promises can give us tremendous courage when we face trials today .
The apostle Paul was an outstanding example in this regard .
How did Paul continue to bear witness when he was in custody in Rome ?
After three days , Paul summoned the principal men of the Jews in order to give them a witness .
( b ) How did Paul respond when not everyone accepted the good news ?
Notice that verse 23 really highlights a number of reasons .
Paul gave a powerful witness , but not everyone responded .
“ Some began to believe the things said ; others would not believe , ” notes verse 24 .
Was Paul disheartened because not everyone accepted the good news ?
An angel led Peter through the massive iron gate
In Paul’s day , such explanations of the Law were invaluable to Christians , and they still are .
They help us to grasp more fully the value of the provisions that God has made for us .
It could hardly have been lost on the ancient Jews that many aspects of the Mosaic Law emphasized their sinfulness .
To this end , a sound red cow was slaughtered and burned .
Its ashes were kept to make “ water for cleansing , ” which was sprinkled on the person being purified on the third and the seventh day after contamination .
1 : 18 , 19 .
Similarly today , you may realize that thoughtlessly , unwittingly , or carelessly , you may have offended a brother .
Anyone who is serious about serving Jehovah would do all in his power to rectify the shortcoming , would he not ?
That could mean apologizing sincerely to the person offended or , in the case of serious wrongdoing , seeking the spiritual assistance of loving Christian overseers .
So it costs us something to rectify a sin committed against a fellow man or against God himself .
Naturally , the host would want to offer his very best to such an honored guest .
The provision of communion sacrifices , part of the Law’s framework of truth , pointed to the fact that by means of Jesus ’ greater sacrifice , all those of mankind who desire to attain an intimate , peaceful relationship with their Creator can do so .
Saul therefore was to exterminate this enemy nation along with its livestock .
Saul also spared the best of their livestock as something that could be sacrificed to Jehovah .
The bad conduct of certain Israelites who made sacrifices in Isaiah’s day showed what ?
Their bad behavior , however , made their sacrifices invalid .
“ I have had enough of whole burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well - fed animals ; and in the blood of young bulls and male lambs and he - goats I have taken no delight . . . .
However , the prayers and offerings of those sincerely striving to live in harmony with God’s commands were acceptable to him .
That realization appropriately produced a contrite heart .
EXERCISE FAITH IN JESUS ’ SACRIFICE !
The advantage we have over those who lived in pre - Christian times is that we no longer have to be content with seeing just “ a shadow ” of God’s purposes .
Thanks to the explanations in the Christian Greek Scriptures , we can understand that by means of the ransom , Jehovah will permanently remove the effects of sin and that even now he allows us to have a good conscience before him .
Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice is a wonderful provision ! ​ — Gal .
3 : 13 ; Heb .
9 : 9 , 14 .
Of course , more than a simple understanding of the ransom sacrifice is needed in order for us to benefit from it .
By so doing , their conduct would harmonize with the divine principles they taught . ​ — Read Romans 2 : 21 - 23 .
Although Christians today are not required to observe the Mosaic Law , they must still present sacrifices that are acceptable to Jehovah .

Which animal would you have offered to Jehovah ?

“ Whatever you are doing , work at it whole - souled as to Jehovah . ” ​ — COL .
What sacrifices do we make in our worship of God ?
So , then , a Christian makes sacrifices for Jehovah , either by offering up certain things to him or by giving up certain things for him .
IN EVERYDAY LIFE
As we go about our everyday lives , it might seem difficult to relate our activities to making sacrifices for Jehovah .
Do we act and dress with proper decorum at all times ?
What is involved in Christian dedication ?
10 , 11 .
Do you seize every opportunity to give a witness ?
It is true that we no longer have to observe a strict Sabbath rest or make regular trips to festivals in Jerusalem .
He called it “ a sweet - smelling odor , an acceptable sacrifice , well - pleasing to God . ”
Paul truly appreciated the Philippians ’ kind gesture , and so did Jehovah .
How should we respond to Christ’s ransom sacrifice ?
Give an example .
Would it be possible for you to improve the sacrifice of praise that you offer to God ?
In our conduct , we need to observe righteous principles carefully , mindful that we represent Jehovah at all times .
In faith , we put full trust in the outworking of God’s purposes .
[ Blurb on page 25 ]
What did Jesus say about the emblems he used ?
Also , the cup in the same way after they had the evening meal , he saying : ‘ This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood , which is to be poured out in your behalf . ’ ”
Such offerings were made to gain Jehovah’s favor , and many served as a token covering for sin .
Yes , their purposes were closely linked .
What would these words have meant to the Israelites ?
For what purpose ?
What services do divinely appointed priests provide ?
So a priest appointed by Jehovah represents sinful people before God by means of prescribed offerings , pleading with Him on their behalf .
Conversely , a priest also represents Jehovah before people , instructing them in divine law .
This awesome prospect came with a condition , though : “ If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant . ”
At about 30 years of age , he presented himself to do Jehovah’s special will for him , symbolizing this by water baptism .
That anointing commissioned him as High Priest for believing ones of the entire human family and as their future King .
( Read Hebrews 9 : 11 , 12 . )
Where would the royal priesthood serve ?
Together with Christ , they make up a royal priesthood to benefit all mankind .
Revelation chapter 21 portrays them as a heavenly city , New Jerusalem , called “ the Lamb’s wife . ”
The tent of God is with mankind , and he will reside with them , and they will be his peoples .
It will mean lifting faithful humans to perfection , completely reconciling them to God .
With these symbolic provisions , “ the nations , ” or family groups of mankind , will be completely cured of the imperfection inherited from Adam .
After the royal priesthood has accomplished its work , how will Jehovah use Christ’s associates ?
According to Revelation 22 : 5 , “ they will rule as kings forever and ever . ”
The Bible does not say .
Of what will those present at the Memorial be reminded ?
The small remnant of anointed Christians still on earth will partake of the emblems of unleavened bread and red wine , signifying their being party to the new covenant .


The royal priesthood will bring eternal benefits to mankind

Before long , a Bible study was started with Dalia .
As Dalia began to understand Bible truths , one question started to bother her more and more .
How , then , does Dalia preach ?
First , Dalia expresses her thoughts to the sisters .
Dalia also witnesses by sending text messages on her mobile phone .
Says Dalia : “ Some months I get worried when I have not yet been out in service .
How can we make our study periods more productive ?
1 PRAY : The first step to take is to pray .
Then I can devote more time to meditating on what I read so as to learn important lessons . ”
“ Study helps me to overcome problems in daily life , and it prepares me to help others , ” says Gabriel , a young brother who has a regular Bible - study routine .
REVIEW : What a privilege we have to delve into the knowledge provided by Jehovah , the Source of all wisdom !
Therefore , the next time you study , make sure you first pray to Jehovah and ask him to give you the proper frame of mind and his holy spirit .
Also , follow through and apply in your daily life the things you learn .
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : AUSTRALIA
HISTORY : TOBACCO FARMER
Many Bosnians , Greeks , Italians , and Serbians , among others , also settled in this area , bringing with them their values , customs , and cultures .
I read the Koran and a book about the prophet Muhammad’s history .
That made a real impression on me .
The Witnesses offered to study the Bible with me and invited me to their meetings , but I always refused .
They proved to be a very helpful resource when others began to test the faith that was growing in my heart .
He had succeeded in convincing Saime’s brother and one of my half brothers to follow him .
Still , she attended my baptism .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : Going through various tests , whether overcoming my shyness , coping with financial anxieties , or dealing with family opposition , has taught me how patient Jehovah God is in helping me deal with my problems .
In fact , my oldest son and his wife are serving as missionaries .
I remember one occasion shortly after we began attending the meetings of the Witnesses as a family .
I parked the car and looked inside the hall at the crowd gathering there .
I asked my family , “ What do you see ? ”
I love being part of this large family of spiritual brothers and sisters , which exists not only in Australia but all over the world . ​ — 1 Peter 5 : 9 .

Soon I was addicted to alcohol .
She showed so much patience and love that I finally agreed to study the Bible .
Nevertheless , that stay in the hospital helped me through the alcohol - withdrawal symptoms .
A Bible passage that brought me great comfort was Lamentations 3 : 55 , 56 , which says : “ I have called out your name , O Jehovah , from a pit of the lowest sort .
My voice you must hear . Do not hide your ear to my relief , to my cry for help . ”
He gave me the strength to keep from returning to my past .
That wasn’t easy for me to do , as I was accustomed to bossing my husband around .
We both quit smoking on the same day .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : My husband kept his promise and began to study the Bible .
Now we read the Bible together every day , meditate on what we read , and try to apply the counsel in our lives .
I’m also grateful to my sister , who never gave up on me .

How could a nursing mother forget her suckling ?
Why does a mother nurse her child and care for its every need ?
A mother naturally has pity for , or pities , “ the son of her belly . ”
A mother’s compassion for her suckling is one of the strongest emotions that we can imagine .
Sadly , though , not every mother has pity for the baby that longs to nurse at her breast .
Is it not comforting to learn about “ the tender compassion of our God ” ?
Why not learn how you can draw closer to Jehovah ?
This loving God assures his worshippers : “ I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 5 . Suggested Bible reading for February : ▪ Isaiah 43 - 62
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you .
God organized descendants of the patriarch Abraham into a nation and gave them a body of laws .
When they were obedient , they benefited from God’s laws .
By studying the history of the Israelites , we can get to know more about the true God . ​ — Read Isaiah 43 : 10 , 12 .
Now , true Christians serve as Jehovah’s witnesses . ​ — Read Acts 15 : 14 , 17 .
This work is reaching its climax .
In 1931 they adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses . ​ — Read Acts 1 : 8 ; 2 : 1 , 4 ; 5 : 42 .
Since Jehovah’s people focus on pleasing God and helping others , they are an organization of happy people . ​ — Read Psalm 33 : 12 ; Acts 20 : 35 .
As they mature , many youths choose to adopt the religion of their parents .
I just feel like giving up . ” ​ — Cora , 18 .
You believe that the Bible promotes the best way of life .
If that is happening , do not conclude that you have failed as a Christian parent .
Other factors may be involved , as we will see .
If you declare war with your adolescent over this issue , you are in for a strenuous battle ​ — a battle that you are almost certain to lose . ​ — Colossians 3 : 21 .
How can you show yourself “ qualified to teach ” if your adolescent questions your faith ?

Be careful , though , not to let the discussion deteriorate into an argument .
Instead , follow the admonition of James 1 : 19 : “ Be swift about hearing , slow about speaking , slow about wrath . ”
For example , if your adolescent balks at attending Christian meetings , try to find out if something else is bothering him .
Well , that’s just too bad !
God requires that parents teach their children about him and that children obey their parents .
I feel so left out !
He stayed so calm as he talked the whole thing out with me ! I don’t know another dad who could just sit there and not start yelling at his daughter when he found out she had kissed a guy and was texting him nonstop .
I feel like I can tell my dad anything . I know he really wants to help me . ”
In time , many young ones learn that if they confront the issue that is impeding their spiritual growth , they will usually feel better about themselves and their faith .
Then I realized that many young people have religious beliefs , but they don’t understand them .
If so , how ?
For example , a young child can be taught that God created all things .
Furthermore , your adolescent is learning to use his “ power of reason . ”
TRY THIS : Go back to the basics with your adolescent , revisiting subjects that you ​ — and he — ​ might have taken for granted .
For example , have him think about such questions as : ‘ What convinces me that there is a God ?
Instead , help him develop his own convictions .
That way he will find it easier to build confidence in his faith .
The Bible speaks of the young man Timothy who “ from infancy ” knew the holy writings .
Now , though , you need to persuade him so that he develops his own convictions .
The book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 1 , states : “ As long as your adolescent lives under your roof , you have the right to require compliance with a spiritual routine .

How can our prayers demonstrate that we are on the watch ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What questions might arise concerning Jesus ’ example of watchfulness ?
Let us address those questions first so that we can see just how relevant and urgent this subject is .
For instance , imagine a man taking his first archery lesson .
Similarly , we keep on striving to improve as Christians by following Jesus ’ instructions and imitating his perfect example .
What , though , about watchfulness ?
Did Jesus actually need this quality ?
For instance , on the final night of his earthly life , Jesus urged his faithful apostles : “ Keep on the watch with me . ”
He added : “ Keep on the watch and pray continually , that you may not enter into temptation . ”
Though he had manifested watchfulness all along , in those dire hours Jesus especially wanted to be watchful and as close to his heavenly Father as possible .
WHY JESUS WANTS US TO BE WATCHFUL
Of course it is !
Like Jesus , we always need to be alert , watching for opportunities to share what we know about God’s Kingdom .
That is why God’s Word exhorts all Christians : “ Keep your senses , be watchful . ”
Not long after asking his followers to keep on the watch with him , Jesus said : “ Keep on the watch and pray continually , that you may not enter into temptation . ”
No , his counsel is a principle we are to live by every day .
( Read Luke 6 : 12 , 13 . )
We can imagine Jesus immersed in telling his Father all his thoughts and concerns about each disciple as he earnestly begs for guidance and wisdom .
What can we learn from Jesus ’ example of praying all night ?
For instance , do we consult our heavenly Father before making any decision that may affect us , our family , or our fellow believers spiritually ?
Do our prayers include concerns about our brothers and sisters in the faith ?
Do we pray from the heart rather than repeat a set form of expressions ?
Notice , too , that Jesus valued intimate , private talk with his Father .
If we make ample time for in - depth , private prayer , we will be more spiritually alert .
25 : 14 .
What example shows us how Jesus kept alert to opportunities to give a witness ?
He could have thought of reasons to avoid a conversation .
Can we more closely imitate Jesus ’ watchful example , perhaps by striving to be increasingly alert to opportunities to share the good news with people we meet in our day - to - day life ?
No , Jesus set a perfect example of balance .
He enjoyed life , taking pleasure in happy times with his friends .
If we imitate Jesus , however , we view our ministry as if it were food .
Yet , we never want to be extremists , displaying a self - righteous or ascetic spirit .
When we face hardships , we need his example more than ever .
If he relies solely on human thinking , such a course could seem justifiable , even upright .
However , it may well result in spiritual sickness or death .
A family head who imitates Jesus ’ watchfulness lets God’s Word guide him , especially in trialsome times .
Without question , Jesus set the best possible example of watchfulness .

“ Be Courageous and Very Strong ”
Others displayed courage in circumstances common to Jehovah’s servants in general .
Enoch foretold what for the ungodly ?
Wicked angels had materialized fleshly bodies , mated with good - looking women , and fathered the Nephilim .
However , when they deliver you up , do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak ; for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour ; for the ones speaking are not just you , but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you . ”
In 1473 B.C.E . , Israel was poised to enter the Promised Land .
She and her household were preserved when the Israelites took Jericho .
How she was blessed for her faith and courage !
When the Israelites marched into the valley plain , God caused a flash flood that turned the battlefield into a quagmire and immobilized the Canaanite chariots .
Barak’s men prevailed , and “ all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword . ”
Why can it be said that our words can inspire courage ?
What we say can inspire courage in fellow worshippers of Jehovah .
When the Assyrians marched against Jerusalem in the eighth century B.C.E . , King Hezekiah told his subjects : “ Be courageous and strong . Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him ; for with us there are more than there are with him . With him there is an arm of flesh , but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles . ”
Why , “ the people began to brace themselves upon the words of Hezekiah ” !
Sometimes courage is shown by what we do not say .
In the tenth century B.C.E . , King Ahab’s steward Obadiah courageously hid a hundred prophets of Jehovah “ by fifties in a cave ” so that they would not be killed at the order of wicked Queen Jezebel .
“ TAKE COURAGE ”
What example do our youngsters have in Jesus ?
Moreover , “ all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers . ”
He triumphed over the world , and so can we . ​ — John 17 : 16 ; Jas .
Not all Christians will experience severe persecution .
The young man was released without reprisals and became a Kingdom publisher .
Enoch preached courageously in an ungodly world
4 : 23 .
while associating with our brothers ?
However , they were generous and showed exemplary love for their fellow believers .
3 , 4 .
The psalmist did not hold back from praising Jehovah when he was with other servants of God .
The psalmist David associated the steadfastness of our heart with our singing .
I will sing and make melody . ”
If we are not familiar with some of the songs , why not practice singing them during Family Worship evening ?
104 : 33 .
Do not forget hospitality . ”
Think also of widows , single - parent families , or other individuals who may benefit from occasionally joining us for a meal or during our family worship .
A fine way to do this is to provide transportation in the field ministry and to and from the meetings for those needing it .
Moreover , would not our arranging to spend more time with our spiritual brothers and sisters make them feel needed and loved ?
When we abound in good deeds “ toward those related to us in the faith ” and are ready to share our time and resources with them , we not only deepen our love for them but also help to build a warm and positive spirit in the congregation . ​ — Gal .
True friends keep personal matters confidential .
May we promote a loving , familylike spirit in the congregation by being a trustworthy friend who can keep things confidential . ​ — Prov .
20 : 19 .
What effect does improving the quality of our field service have on the spirit of others in the congregation ?
Jesus sent his disciples out to preach in twos rather than individually .
Do we not appreciate working with zealous Kingdom publishers ?
What kind of spirit did some Israelites in Moses ’ day develop , and what effect did this have on them ?
We are wise to limit our association with people who are negative or who are promoting an independent attitude . ​ — Prov .
The corruptive influence of murmuring can lead to other spiritually damaging developments .
How wrong and hurtful it is to spread confidential information about someone !
So if we know that a brother or a sister has fallen into such wrongdoing , we should encourage that one to approach the elders and seek their help .
How does our reporting serious wrongdoing help to preserve the spirit of the congregation ?
ENCOURAGE “ THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT ”
What will help us to “ observe the oneness of the spirit ” ?
By “ devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles , ” Jesus ’ early followers helped to develop a spirit of unity within the congregation .
When we submit to the Bible - based instruction from Jehovah’s organization and follow the direction of the elders , we give proof that we are “ earnestly endeavoring to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace . ” ​ — Eph .
4 : 3 .
4 : 23 .
Do you contribute to a positive spirit by preparing meaningful comments ?
What can others do to help fellow believers who live in religiously divided households ?
What effect can acceptance of the Kingdom message have on a family ?
WHEN Jesus sent out his apostles on one occasion , he said : “ As you go , preach , saying , ‘ The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near . ’ ”
Why is happiness not out of reach for Christians who live in religiously divided households ?
Believers can add to their own happiness ( 1 ) by endeavoring to cultivate peace in the home and ( 2 ) by sincerely trying to help unbelieving family members to embrace true worship .
Why should a Christian in a divided household cultivate peace ?
For the seed of righteousness to bear fruit in a family environment , peaceful conditions in the home are essential .
How can this be done ?
Sharing in Christian activities in some way is generally possible for believers living in divided households .
This may present a challenge because what they want us to do may at times conflict with Bible principles .
They may even acknowledge that this could be good for the family .
A student whose mate is opposed should be helped to see that he does not have to discontinue his Bible study .
So I asked him to read the book I was studying .

* ( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 12 - 16 . )
Reflecting on his reaction to learning Bible truth , Jason says , “ I wanted to tell everyone ! ”
A few well - placed droplets of truth will often do more good than a spiritual downpour would .
( b ) How did one Bible student learn to apply the counsel recorded at 1 Peter 3 : 1 , 2 ?
“ Be in subjection to your own husbands , ” he wrote , “ in order that , if any are not obedient to the word , they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives , because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect . ”
3 : 7 - 9 .
Many modern - day examples illustrate the value of applying Peter’s counsel .
When she began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses , her husband , Steve , was not pleased .
Selma observes : “ Even before I got the truth , living with Steve was like walking on eggshells .
When I started studying the Bible , this characteristic intensified . ”
But the sister made me think differently by asking , ‘ How many of those acts of love do you show toward your husband ? ’
The sister softly said , ‘ Selma , who is trying to be a Christian here ?
Slowly , things started to change . ”
“ The love of my brothers and sisters was what helped me to stand firm in the truth , ” says Elvina in Brazil .
Kindness and interest on the part of others in the congregation can do much to affect the heart of an unbelieving family member .
In England , a wife who came into the truth 18 years after her husband did recalls : “ The Witnesses invited both of us for meals . I always felt welcome . ”
This was especially noticeable when I was in the hospital and many came to visit me . ”
15 , 16 .
Of course , not all unbelieving spouses , children , parents , or other relatives embrace true worship , even after years of faithful conduct and tactful witnessing on the part of the believer .
17 , 18 .
Indeed , “ roll upon Jehovah your way , and rely upon him . ”
“ Persevere in prayer , ” and have faith that our loving heavenly Father can help you to endure hardships of all kinds . ​ — Rom .
12 : 12 .
In these endeavors , how heartening it is to know that you have the loving support of your brothers and sisters in the Christian congregation !
[ Picture on page 28 ]
Show concern for unbelieving mates
This was followed by Kingdom News No . 3 .
It took faith and courage to put out Kingdom News . ”
Today , new Kingdom publishers usually receive training in the ministry , but that was not always so .
I do not know what I said , but I placed a publication with her .
On one occasion , she and a Witness couple were preaching in a mountainous area of California , U.S.A .
“ When he began playing the recorded message , it almost sounded as if it came from heaven .
After the record was finished , we called on the people and witnessed to them .
I worked with two other sound cars and can assure you that most people did not want to hear the message .
Earlier , there were information marches .
It took real courage to stand on a corner holding the magazines and calling out the slogans suggested for our use .
Yet , we seldom missed a Saturday .
Courage has always been required to engage in the Kingdom - preaching work
Julius Caesar had it .
Alexander the Great had it .
Cristina , a regular pioneer , says : “ I often find myself looking enviously at others .
So how is it that you are in the traveling work and we are nothing ? ”
When he was not appointed but others were , he became envious of them and harbored ill feelings toward the coordinator of the body of elders .
WHAT SCRIPTURAL EXAMPLES TEACH US
For instance , Adam and Eve’s firstborn son , Cain , felt angry when Jehovah accepted Abel’s sacrifice but not his .
Cain could have remedied this situation , but he became so blinded by envy that he killed his brother .
In the case of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , envy arose when they compared their privileges with those of Moses and Aaron .
Finally , envy led to their destruction at Jehovah’s hand . ​ — Ps .
During the subsequent trial , the liar even consented to the idea of killing the surviving baby .
What measures can we take as antidotes to envy ?
18 : 1 .
Association with fellow worshippers helped the psalmist to recognize the blessings he derived from “ drawing near to God . ”
After observing that envy and hatred had developed in Cain , God told him : “ Turn to doing good . ”
NOT AN EASY FIGHT !
Envy is one of “ the works of the flesh , ” against which every Christian should fight .
Nathan ​ — Loyal Advocate of Pure Worship
But Jehovah did not let the king’s sins pass unnoticed .
He sent his prophet Nathan to confront David .
The rich man happened to have very many sheep and cattle ; but the man of little means had nothing but one female lamb , a small one , that he had bought .
After a while a visitor came to the rich man , but he spared taking some from his own sheep and his own cattle to get such ready for the traveler that had come in to him . So he took the female lamb of the man of little means and got it ready for the man that had come in to him . ” ​ — 2 Sam .
Nathan’s story made David furious .
It is not easy for a person who has become emotionally entangled with someone to view his situation objectively .
All of us tend to make excuses in an attempt to justify ourselves if our actions are questionable .
But Nathan’s illustration moved David unwittingly to condemn his own actions .
The king saw clearly that the conduct Nathan described was deplorable .
Then David could see the magnitude of his sin .
He acknowledged that he had indeed “ despised ” Jehovah by his conduct in connection with Bath - sheba , and he accepted the deserved reproof . ​ — 2 Sam .
A Bible teacher’s objective is to help his listeners arrive at the right conclusion .
We too can help sincere individuals to understand Jehovah’s point of view .
Both of them loved Jehovah .
As a faithful worshipper of Jehovah , Nathan enthusiastically endorsed David’s plan to construct the first permanent center of pure worship on earth .
Without murmuring , however , this humble prophet acquiesced to Jehovah’s purpose and cooperated with it .
Nathan’s subsequent acts as a prophet show that he did not lose God’s favor .
DEFENDER OF THE KINGSHIP
Tact and loyalty again characterized Nathan’s actions .
Realizing the gravity of the situation , the aged king instructed Nathan and other loyal servants to have Solomon anointed and proclaimed king .
Adonijah’s coup was thwarted . ​ — 1 Ki .
Jehovah God assigned him weighty responsibilities .
You are unlikely to be called upon to reprove adulterous kings or to thwart coups .
“ It caused some comment , ” she reported , “ and made me a little conspicuous . ”
Those Christians who were willing and able traveled far and wide ​ — through towns , villages , and rural areas — ​ offering these books described as “ Helping Hands for Bible Students ” to other eager readers .
“ Fifty books weigh forty pounds , ” ( 18 kg ) admitted The Watch Tower , making deliveries “ too great a strain , ” especially for sisters .
To solve the Dawn delivery dilemma , Brother James Cole invented a foldable , two - wheeled frame to which a suitcase could be attached by screws .
The height could be adjusted , and the wheels could roll along wagon - wheel tracks .
Otherwise , it cost $ 2.50 ( U.S . ) .

7 “ I Have Made Your Name Known ”
18 Did You Know ?
According to the Atlas of Global Christianity , in 2010 there were almost 2.3 billion worldwide .
Let us look at the matter from a different perspective .
He also needs to prove that he is who he claims to be by producing some identification , perhaps a passport .
What would that be ?
Note that those called Christians were Christ’s disciples .
In prayer to his heavenly Father , Jehovah God , Jesus said : “ Your word is truth . ”
He frequently quoted God’s Word to support his teachings .
Who Fit the Pattern Today ? : According to the Vatican’s Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation , adopted in 1965 and quoted in the Catechism of the Catholic Church : “ It is not from Sacred Scripture alone that the [ Catholic ] Church draws her certainty about everything which has been revealed .
Their moral code also set them apart .
Christians were told : “ Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery , they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you . ”
Regarding Christian neutrality , the New Catholic Encyclopedia asserts : “ Conscientious objection is morally indefensible . ”
He learned that Jehovah’s Witnesses stood firm in their beliefs in spite of the harsh treatment they received .
The journal quotes a church deacon , who said : “ A great percentage I see ​ — I’d guess it’s well over 50 percent — ​ are already living together when they come to be married . ”
Finally , Christ showed love in the greatest way possible .
A recent U.S . study found a strong link between religious people ​ — most of whom identified themselves as Christian — ​ and racial bias .
The Tosefta , a collection of Jewish laws completed by about 300 C.E . , says regarding the burning of Christian writings by opposers : “ The books of the Evangelists and the books of the minim [ thought to be Jewish Christians ] they do not save from a fire .
But they are allowed to burn where they are , . . . they and the references to the Divine Name which are in them . ”
He sent his disciples to preach the good news in the towns and villages and later commanded them : “ You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 8 ; Luke 10 : 1 .
How Early Christians Measured Up : Jesus ’ disciples wasted no time in doing what Jesus told them .
Who Fit the Pattern Today ?
“ The church’s failure to take preaching and teaching seriously is one reason for the general spiritual malaise of today , ” writes Anglican priest David Watson .
An interesting and realistic observation made by Jonathan Turley is found in Cato Supreme Court Review , 2001 - 2002 : “ Mention the Jehovah’s Witnesses , and most people immediately think of preachers visiting our homes at inconvenient hours .
Do You Recognize the Mark ?
Though there are tens of thousands of groups and denominations claiming to be Christian , bear in mind what Jesus told his followers : “ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will . ”
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible .
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you .
How should Jesus ’ death be remembered ?
The bread represents Jesus ’ body , and the wine his blood . ​ — Read Luke 22 : 19 , 20 .
So Jehovah provided a new covenant . ​ — Read Jeremiah 31 : 31 .
Through them , millions from all nations will be blessed with everlasting life in an earthly paradise .
But in other cases , memories may seem more like a curse .
The new heavens , then , is a new government , one capable of establishing righteous conditions on earth .
First , in the Bible the term “ earth ” at times refers to people , not the globe .
Can you begin to see how Jehovah will cut off painful memories at their source ?

30 Questions From Readers
32 “ Would You Please Take Our Picture ? ”
MALAWI
POPULATION

One day , Jehovah’s Witnesses called on my father , and I asked them if God has a name .
One year , it was my parents ’ turn to accommodate the new teacher , John Didur .
Having been born in 1931 , John had heard of the hardships of war .
The following year , I was too .
Five of us set off for New York City by car from Saskatchewan .
A year later , in 1959 , we were pioneering and living in a small house trailer on top of a prairie hill in Saskatchewan .
What a contrast it proved to be to the open prairies !
As we were looking for accommodations the first day , a little girl heard our conversation with her neighbor .
He did not realize that John understood Ukrainian !
Shortly thereafter , we left Red Lake because John was to be trained for the circuit work .
I learned much from her quiet , gentle ways .
BETHEL SERVICE
That continued when we moved to Bethel in 1977 .
We had attended the large international convention in St .
Those had attracted us to our brothers in Eastern Europe .
It felt almost like being on a Saskatchewan farm .
There are over 50 congregations in Lviv , 21 of which use a big Kingdom Hall complex .
We had just gone down to the platform of the busy underground metro system when a young girl walked over to us and quietly said , “ I’m lost . I can’t find my grandma . ”
Brothers from many countries came to Ukraine in May 2001 for the dedication of our new branch facilities .
After the special talk at a stadium on Sunday morning , a sea of brothers came walking up the road to tour the new Bethel .
Though he could hardly speak , his eyes always showed appreciation for all who visited him .
I felt that a very big part of me was missing .
It has been a pleasant life , with the best of association .
Have you ever been asked to give advice to others ?
For example , have you ever been asked such questions as : ‘ What should I do ?
On what will you base your reply ?
What is your custom in giving advice to others ?
Consider how the following five Bible principles can help as to giving advice .
1 Discern the Real Situation .
18 : 13 .
Could you advise him of the best route to take without first knowing his present location ?
“ What research have you already done ? ”
“ Every man must be swift about hearing , slow about speaking . ” ​ — JAS .
The apostle Peter , after he learned of Jesus ’ difficult assignment , advised Jesus : “ Be kind to yourself , Lord ; you will not have this destiny at all . ”

Even if the answer to the inquiry seems obvious , you would do well to learn from the pattern of humility and modesty that Jesus left .
Jesus has appointed a trusted slave class that dispenses vital spiritual food .
What a mistake it would be to overlook this wealth of information !
How skilled are you at helping others investigate Bible principles and reason on God’s Word ?
5 Avoid Trying to Make Decisions for Others .
In the end , each person needs to choose for himself which counsel and advice to follow .
Some matters are best referred to congregation elders or if the inquirer is a young person , to his parents .
The Watchtower Library on CD - ROM is currently available in 39 languages .
When truly based on Bible principles , our advice will prove to be sound and may contribute to the everlasting good of the listener .

1 , 2 .
Others lose their jobs because they do not wake up in time to go to work or because they fall asleep on the job .
But spiritual drowsiness can have far more serious effects .
Even some of Christendom’s leaders have referred to their flocks as ‘ sleeping giants . ’
Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 4 - 8 .
One way we can “ sleep on ” is by ignoring Jehovah’s moral standards .
Another way we can “ sleep on ” is by ignoring the fact that Jehovah’s time to destroy the ungodly has approached .
He might reason , ‘ If no one is going to respond , why be energetic in trying to reach or help people ? ’
Part of our staying awake involves reminding ourselves why our ministry is vital .
WHAT MAKES OUR MINISTRY VITAL ?
Soon , those who do not obey the good news will undergo judicial punishment .
( Read 1 Timothy 4 : 16 . )
Jesus could respond to the spiritual need of each one .
By our striving to be alert and observant like Jesus and Paul , we can discern how best to awaken interest in those we meet .
For example , as you approach individuals , look for clues that indicate their culture , interests , or family situation .
SHOW PERSONAL INTEREST
13 , 14 . ( a ) How can we discern what interests a person ?
What questions can you pose in order to get someone in your territory to express his feelings ?
Others may be intrigued by the questions : Does God hear all prayers ?
15 : 13 .
Many do not react well when awakened suddenly .
For example , if someone reacts angrily to your visit , what is usually the best response ?
Your kindness may move such a person to react more positively the next time a Witness calls .
16 , 17 .
How can we use insight in our ministry ?
In other cases , you may be able to overcome a negative reaction .
Yet , with skill and kind persistence , you may be able to raise an intriguing question that awakens the householder’s interest in spiritual things . ​ — Read Colossians 4 : 6 .
Some brothers are able to open the Bible , read a thought - provoking text , and leave the householder with a question ​ — all in less than a minute .
They may also have a specific Bible text in mind to share with others if the opportunity arises .
We might imagine that there is little we can do or say that will change their attitude .
Should we not speak as kindly to them as we do to those we meet in the preaching work ?
Speak with mildness and respect .
Without being preachy , give evidence of how the truth has affected you for the good .
After mailing her the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , I called her every few days .
But she still had not opened the book .
After a few more calls , she wanted to study for more than 15 minutes .
Why should we not tire out in trying to awaken people from spiritual sleep ?
So let us take to heart Paul’s counsel to our first - century brother Archippus : “ Keep watching the ministry which you accepted in the Lord , that you fulfill it . ”
[ Box on page 13 ]
▪ Be aware of the danger of spiritual slumber
▪ Maintain a positive view of people in your territory
Maintain Your Sense of Urgency
For example , firefighters rush to an emergency call ; they know that lives may be in danger .
As Jehovah’s Witnesses , we hope to help people to be saved .
To appreciate why Paul exhorted Timothy to preach with urgency , consider some of the context of our theme scripture .
We may encounter what popular ideas in our ministry ?
Priests and pastors tickle the ears of others by convincing them that ceremonies , Masses , fiestas , and images have God’s blessing .
Little do these churchgoers realize the danger of their situation .
Yet , if we can awaken them spiritually so that they understand the Bible’s true message , they can benefit from God’s Kingdom .
Your situation is urgent .
You likely would not charge out of his office like a fireman on an emergency call .
In addition , for two years he followed a regular schedule of “ daily giving talks in the school auditorium of Tyrannus . ”
The call to ‘ be at our ministry urgently ’ is not intended to overwhelm us with our commission .
The example of a small group of Bible Students who prior to 1914 set out to preach the good news illustrates what it means to have a sense of urgency .
4 : 10 .
If we are to maintain our sense of urgency , we need to fight the urge to enjoy more of what life offers .
We now have the privilege of being light bearers .
Amid such wickedness , let us ‘ buy out the time ’ for activities that can keep us spiritually awake .
WE LIVE IN MOMENTOUS TIMES
Mankind’s survival is threatened as never before .
Authorities report hundreds of instances of nuclear material being “ lost . ”
The effect could be widespread destruction from rising sea levels , droughts , floods , epidemics , hurricanes , and wars over diminished resources .
Never before have so many features of the sign been so clearly evident .
Others become conscious of man’s need for help as they contemplate the failure of human governments to cope with economic disasters , nuclear threats , violent crime , or environmental destruction .
MOVED BY A SENSE OF URGENCY
They made a list of things they did not need , and within three months they moved from their three - bedroom apartment to a single - bedroom place , sold some things , and became debt free .
A North American brother writes : “ When my wife and I attended an assembly in 2006 , we had been baptized for 30 years .
Feeling that we must have looked like foolish Christians , we decided to make the full - time ministry our goal .
We know what will soon overtake this wicked system of things ​ — “ the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men . ”
As with anointed Christians , such a hope will prove to be “ an anchor for the soul , both sure and firm ” for other Christians .
Our hope is something we can cling to during the storms of life , something that will help us not to drift into doubt or lack of faith . ​ — Read Hebrews 2 : 1 ; 6 : 11 .
The remaining members of the “ little flock ” of anointed Christians have the hope of immortal life in heaven as kings and priests with Christ in his Kingdom .
In his first letter , Peter wrote : “ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance .
Peter states that this “ new birth ” opens up to them “ a living hope , ” which he calls “ an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance ” reserved for them “ in the heavens . ”
In his second letter , Peter exhorted anointed Christians to ‘ do their utmost to make their calling and choosing of themselves sure . ’
Peter stated : “ If these things exist in you and overflow , they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful . ” ​ — Read 2 Peter 1 : 5 - 8 .
5 : 4 ; Rev .
2 : 10 .
About the year 65 C.E . , Jesus ’ half brother Jude wrote a letter to his fellow anointed Christians , whom he addressed as “ the called ones . ”
He had intended to write them a letter centering on the glorious hope of salvation that Christians called to God’s heavenly Kingdom “ hold in common . ”
Although he had other urgent issues to address , at the conclusion of his short letter , he referred to the wonderful hope shared by anointed Christians , writing : “ Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy , to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , might and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity . ” ​ — Jude 24 , 25 .
When one of the anointed dies faithful , it is with the sure prospect of being “ raised up a spiritual body , ” resurrected “ in incorruption . . . , in glory . ”
1 : 13 .
The realization of this hope is related to “ the revealing of the sons of God . ”
He pointed out that their hope is not founded on their works , but on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness .
( b ) How will our hope be fulfilled ?
Not only must we keep our hope alive but we must also live in harmony with our hope .
That includes doing all we can to maintain the unity of our worldwide brotherhood even among those in our local congregation .
Why should we “ remember the wife of Lot ” ?

What three things should we avoid dwelling on ?
His Jewish audience needed no further explanation .
Whatever the reason for her looking back , she paid for her disobedient act with her life .
Either way he is distracted from what he should be doing , and his work may be affected negatively .
Rather than turning our attention to the past , we must keep our eyes focused on what is yet ahead .
We now face , not just the wiping out of two wicked cities , but the destruction of an entire world system of things .
God’s people eventually faced a type of genocide as Pharaoh attempted to limit their numbers .
About what ?
They became dissatisfied with what Jehovah supplied and complained : “ How we remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for nothing , the cucumbers and the watermelons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic !
Yes , their viewpoint had become distorted ​ — so much so that they even wanted to return to the land of their slavery !
The Israelites looked at the things behind and lost Jehovah’s favor . ​ — Num .
The Israelites ’ example provides what lesson for us ?
When faced with difficulties and problems , let us not fixate on what may appear to have been positive things in the past ​ — perhaps even before we came to a knowledge of the truth .
Otherwise , we could accentuate our dissatisfaction with our present circumstances and be tempted to return to our former way of life . ​ — Read 2 Peter 2 : 20 - 22 .
Many of our brothers and sisters have left behind lucrative positions in the fields of business , entertainment , education , or sports .
Do you fantasize about what could have happened had you not made those sacrifices ?
And why ?
On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse , that I may gain Christ . ”
He no longer felt that they were worthwhile .
You have gained a treasured relationship with Jehovah and have established a faithful record with him .
When we meditate on the examples of faithful servants of God ​ — whether past or present — ​ we can gain additional motivation to keep moving forward rather than looking at the things behind .
For example , if Abraham and Sarah had kept remembering Ur , “ they would have had opportunity to return . ”
Perhaps we are overwhelmed by thoughts of past sins or mistakes that we made .
However , rather than allowing these negative thoughts to overwhelm him , Paul focused on the undeserved kindness that had been shown to him .
The resulting gratitude that he felt spurred him on in his ministry .
Whether we “ belittle ” the counsel because we reject it or we “ give out ” because we accept it and then give up , the result is the same ​ — we do not truly allow the counsel to benefit and refine us .
Safeguard it , for it itself is your life . ”
3 : 19 - 24 .
How can we prove that we “ remember the wife of Lot ” ?
We live in exciting times .
Could a Christian’s practice of viewing pornography become so bad that it results in his being expelled from the Christian congregation ?
Pornography is found everywhere around the globe .
Others have deliberately gone to them , feeling less inhibited because they can read or view pornography in secret ​ — at home or at the office .
Of course , normal sexual relations are proper and a source of pleasure between marriage mates .
3 : 5 .
How could the Christian have a clean conscience and be at peace with God if he was gazing at pornographic images of naked men or women or of a couple engaging in fornication ?
73 : 2 , 14 .
Those who have sought help to remove the stain of pornography have seen that drawing near to God has been good for them , as it was for Asaph . ​ — Ps .
Vincent wrote that it has “ the sense of impurity on the side of sordidness . ”
It is a sad fact that some pornography is much worse than scenes of nakedness or of a man and woman engaging in fornication .
Paul also mentioned “ uncleanness ” at Galatians 5 : 19 .
He would have to be disfellowshipped in order to preserve the cleanness and spirit of the congregation . ​ — 1 Cor .
It is good to know that some who fell into viewing abhorrent forms of pornography went to the elders and received the spiritual help needed to make drastic changes .

● “ I believe Jesus Christ is the only son of God , fully human and fully divine , both at the same time . ”
Is there one reliable source of information that can give authoritative answers to our questions about Jesus ?
* ​ — 2 Timothy 3 : 16 .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Rather , he openly mingled with people in their villages and cities .
* For example , Jesus referred to Jehovah as “ my God ” and “ the only true God . ”
Jesus also showed that he was separate from God .
Jesus once said to opposers who challenged his authority : “ In your own Law it is written , ‘ The witness of two men is true . ’
This expression indicates that he was fully human and not God incarnate .
With remarkable clarity and simplicity , he explained what God’s Kingdom is and what it will do in fulfilling Jehovah’s will . ​ — Matthew 6 : 9 , 10 .
QUESTION : Was Jesus the promised Messiah ?
● Fulfilled prophecies .
QUESTION : Why did Jesus have to suffer and die ?
Still , Jesus expected such mistreatment and willingly submitted to it . ​ — Matthew 20 : 17 - 19 ; 1 Peter 2 : 21 - 23 .
Jesus fully expected to be raised from the dead .
● Eyewitness testimony .
● Credible witnesses .
Those disciples were willing to die rather than renounce their faith in Jesus .
But do the answers really matter ?
For a discussion on how the Biblical Gospels differ from spurious writings about Jesus , see the article “ Apocryphal Gospels ​ — Hidden Truths About Jesus ? ”
on pages 20 - 22 . For a list of some of the prophecies that were fulfilled in Jesus , see page 200 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Do the Answers Matter ?
It matters to Jehovah .
● Why does it matter to Jehovah ?
God is eager to give the gift of everlasting life to those who learn the truth about his Son and act in harmony with it . ​ — Romans 6 : 23 .
Jehovah through Jesus offers you and your loved ones the prospect of perfect health and unending life in a new world , free from pain and suffering .
“ I PRAYED to Jehovah to please let me come home and to forgive me for hurting him . ”
To answer those questions , let us examine words recorded by Jeremiah .
The people came to their senses in captivity and were moved to repentance .
He heard the Israelites as they lamented the effects of their sinful course .
They were like a wayward son ruefully shaking his head as he reflects on the hardships he has brought upon himself and longs for the life he had back home .
“ Cause me to turn back , and I shall readily turn back , for you are Jehovah my God . ”
I became ashamed , and I also felt humiliated . ”
As if beating their breast , they also felt disgraced and cast down . ​ — Luke 15 : 18 , 19 , 21 .
He said : “ I have become to Israel a Father ; and as for Ephraim , he is my firstborn . ”
How tender those words are !
He could never do that .
A loving father does not forget his children .
“ Jehovah Let Me Come Home ! ”
What if such ones want to return to him ?
If you once served Jehovah and have thought about serving him again , we invite you to visit the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
The other was the northern ten - tribe kingdom of Israel , also called Ephraim , for its most prominent tribe .
Read what these people have to say .
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : CYPRUS
I also developed a quick temper .
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE : I became close friends with a fellow drug user who had lost his father at a young age .
Having grown up knowing about the hope of a resurrection , I soon found myself telling him about Jesus ​ — that he raised the dead and that he promises to do so again in the future .
Those thoughts touched my friend’s heart .
The more I spoke about Jehovah to my friend , the more I found myself thinking about Jehovah .
Many of my friends claimed to love God , but their conduct said otherwise .
Not wanting to be like that , I realized what I needed to do .
Sometimes I would do well for a while and then suffer a relapse .
Discouraged , I approached the elder who was studying the Bible with me .
* We discussed steps that I could take when I felt angry .
I also think of Jesus ’ words found at John 6 : 44 : “ No man can come to me unless the Father , who sent me , draws him . ”
By that time , I had developed a love for music , and I realized that I had a knack for it .
In an effort to alleviate those feelings , I would get drunk and take drugs with my bandmates , whom I considered my family .
I had a rebellious attitude , which was evident in my appearance .
I wore dark clothing , grew a beard , and let my hair grow almost down to my waist .
The drug dealers beat me so badly that I ended up with a fractured jaw .
I also continued playing and recording with heavy - metal and death - metal bands .
However , I knew who could .
Although visibly shaken by my appearance , he kindly answered my questions regarding meetings at the Kingdom Hall .
I was convinced that this encounter was the answer to my prayer .
They welcomed me and embraced me so affectionately that I felt an overwhelming peace .
I came to understand Jesus ’ teaching recorded at Matthew 6 : 24 , which says that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
As I struggled to make changes , the principle recorded at 1 Corinthians 15 : 33 hit home : “ Bad associations spoil useful habits . ”
I also cut my hair , shaved off my beard , and stopped dressing only in black .
She loved what she saw there , and soon she began studying the Bible herself .
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED : I have escaped from a world of sham happiness and treacherous associates .
I still love music , but I am selective now .
Above all , by drawing close to Jehovah , I have finally found my Father .

“ I have been able to return to Jehovah because he drew me back ”
Learn From God’s Word
Baptism is a request for a good relationship with God .
In the days of Jesus ’ apostles , many people took action without delay to learn about God and Jesus .
Jesus was about 30 years of age when John the Baptizer dipped him under the water of the Jordan River .
Yet , Jesus ’ sacrificial death makes it possible for us to have a good relationship with God .
How can you prepare for baptism ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses study the Bible with anyone who wants to draw close to God .

Why can we be confident that Jehovah will deliver us ?
POPULATION
TRANSLATION WORK
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
Why was Jesus in a unique position to reveal his Father ?
One author and clergyman acknowledged : “ This is a doctrine beyond the scope of man’s finite mind .
Little wonder that the majority of mankind are left in ignorance and confusion as to the truth about the Father , the Creator of the universe ! ​ — Isa .
Yet , it is vital that people learn the truth about God .
Jesus was especially qualified to reveal his Father .
The Father designated the Son to be His spokesman , “ The Word of God . ”
With that expression , John alludes to a custom that in his day was common at mealtimes . One guest would recline right in front of another person on the same couch .
The same is true of God’s other qualities that Jesus revealed to his disciples while he was on earth .
HOW JESUS REVEALED HIS FATHER
( b ) Give an example that shows how Jesus revealed his Father through his teaching .
Let us first consider Jesus ’ teachings .
Jesus said that when the owner finds the lost sheep , “ he rejoices more over it than over the ninety - nine that have not strayed . ”
The second way in which Jesus revealed the Father to his disciples was by means of his conduct .
So when the apostle Philip asked Jesus : “ Show us the Father , ” Jesus could rightly say : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father also . ”
It reminds us that God has not only the unlimited power to wipe wickedness from the face of the earth but also the ardent desire to do so .
This depiction of Jesus ’ strong reaction to wrongdoing reveals how the Father must feel as he looks at the wickedness that is rampant on earth today .
What can you learn about Jehovah from the way Jesus treated his disciples ?
Moreover , Jesus had seen such inclinations manifested by Satan the Devil .
That egotistic individual cared greatly about prominence and position .
Hence , how grieved Jesus must have been to see an ambitious attitude continue among the disciples he had trained !
THE SON WILLINGLY REVEALED HIS FATHER
Why did Jesus hold back some information about his Father ?
As Jesus explained , though , a great deal of knowledge would be revealed upon the arrival of “ the helper , ” the holy spirit , that would guide them “ into all the truth . ”
16 , 17 .
As we have considered , Jesus had far deeper knowledge of his Father than others did .
How grateful we are that Jesus through his teachings and conduct willingly revealed his Father to us !
Keep in mind that many we meet in field service do not know who God is .
What warning lessons can we learn from the betrayals committed by Delilah , Absalom , and Judas Iscariot ?
But why should this be of concern to us ?
A modern - day author lists betrayal among today’s most common vices .
That is to be expected .

“ To betray ” means “ to give up to , or place in the power of an enemy , by treachery or disloyalty . ”
Indeed , such acts are an ominous sign of the times !
What lessons can we learn from the Bible about those who were disloyal in the past ?
What examples of people who proved their devotion to others can we imitate ?
WARNING EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST
Perhaps knowing that Delilah had no loyal love for Samson , the five Philistine lords offered her a large bribe to find out the secret of his superior strength so that they could eliminate him .
Mercenary Delilah accepted their offer , but her attempts to uncover Samson’s secret failed three times .
Finally , “ his soul got to be impatient to the point of dying . ”
How contemptible her action was !
And for what did money - loving Judas do that ?
For a mere 30 pieces of silver !
Could any lessons be more powerful to help us reject the loathsome trait of disloyalty ?
( b ) How can we imitate Jonathan ?
He did not jealously view David as a rival .
Jonathan did all he could to ‘ strengthen David’s hand , ’ even to the point of risking his own life to stand up for David in front of Saul .
1 : 17 , 26 .
Likewise today , even if we may not have been given a special privilege in the congregation , we should willingly support the brothers who have been appointed to take the lead among us . ​ — 1 Thess .
Even so , Peter was determined to be loyal to God’s anointed Son .
Likewise today , how do we react if we encounter a point in our Christian publications from “ the faithful steward ” that is hard to understand or that does not match with our thinking ?
Often , a first step in that direction is taken when marriage mates become emotionally distant from each other .
Professor of Sociology Gabriella Turnaturi explains that alternating “ between being fully present in a relationship and not being fully present is where betrayal finds its niche . ”
This distancing of oneself from a marriage mate has happened to some even during middle age .
For example , a 50 - year - old married man divorces his faithful wife of 25 years in order to join up with another woman to whom he has become attracted .
( a ) How does Jehovah feel about treachery in a marriage ?
They have to focus on preserving their marriage and their relationship with Jehovah .
16 , 17 . ( a ) How might our loyalty to God be put on the line in the family and the congregation ?
( b ) What example illustrates that obeying God’s command to quit associating with disfellowshipped relatives can lead to good results ?
May we all remain ever steadfast in our loyalty to God and to one another .
[ Footnotes ]

One part of the human body , though , is referred to figuratively in the Bible far more often than any other .
Though God’s Word does not provide a dictionary definition of the word “ heart , ” it allows us to discern the meaning of that word .
( a ) What does “ heart ” represent ?
As one reference work states , it is “ the sum total of the interior man . ” In some cases , “ heart ” has a narrower meaning .
For example , Jesus said : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ”
In this instance , “ heart ” refers to the emotions , desires , and feelings of the inner person .
Regarding the heart , King David reminded Solomon : “ My son , know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul ; for all hearts Jehovah is searching , and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning . ”
Those men were willing to accept Jesus ’ invitation ​ — but on certain conditions .
Unlike those would - be disciples , we have wisely accepted Jesus ’ invitation to be his followers and are now serving Jehovah every day .
Yet , even though we are active in the congregation , we still need to be aware of a potential risk to our heart condition .
A field laborer is busy plowing .
Though there is still much work to be done before the field is planted , the laborer is distracted and his work suffers .
What parallel could we draw between the laborer in Jesus ’ illustration and some Christians today ?
The farmer could represent any Christian who seems to be doing well but actually is in spiritual danger .
For comparison’s sake , let us imagine a brother who keeps busy in the ministry .
All of us , therefore , need to make sure that nothing in Satan’s world , no matter how useful or pleasant it may seem to be , holds us back from being wholehearted in caring for Kingdom interests . ​ — 2 Cor . 11 : 14 ; read Philippians 3 : 13 , 14 .
14 , 15 . ( a ) How is Satan trying to affect our heart condition ?
Our heart is still his target .
5 : 8 .
How can we protect ourselves against such schemes of Satan and maintain a complete heart toward Jehovah ?
Prayer is vital .
Jesus ’ example shows that prayers have degrees of intensity .
Therefore , the more severe our trials are and the more insidious Satan’s schemes are , the “ more earnestly ” we should pray for Jehovah’s protection .
( a ) What should we ask ourselves about prayer , and why ?
Yes , we have to pray fervently and frequently in order to maintain a complete heart toward Jehovah .
Your answer reveals much about the depth of your heartfelt desire to serve God .
86 : 11 .

1 Nourishment : Our literal heart needs to receive sufficient amounts of healthful nourishment .
Likewise , we need to make sure that we get sufficient amounts of wholesome spiritual food through regular personal study , meditation , and meeting attendance . ​ — Ps .
1 : 1 , 2 ; Prov .
As “ the great day of Jehovah ” unfolds , earthly society will descend into chaos .
2 , 3 . ( a ) What will God’s people face during the “ great tribulation ” ?
No human agency will come to the defense of Jehovah’s people .
Let us consider three examples that will instill in us confidence in Jehovah’s ability to deliver his people .
First , consider the account of the Flood of Noah’s day .
The colossal task of building the ark had to be completed and the animals had to be safely loaded on board before the floodwaters fell .
The Bible tells us that Jehovah issued a decree in heaven .
* Since the Flood began in 2370 B.C.E . , we infer that God made this pronouncement in 2490 B.C.E .
Some 20 years later , in the year 2470 B.C.E . , Noah’s sons began to be born .
( b ) When did God finally tell Noah exactly when the Flood would begin ?
9 , 10 .
The second example that we will consider highlights yet another reason we can trust in Jehovah to deliver his people : He will use the unlimited power at his disposal to make sure that his will takes place .
So certain is Jehovah’s ability to deliver his servants that he at times has used them to lure his enemies into a trap .
The Israelites who departed from Egypt may have numbered some three million people .
( b ) What was the outcome of God’s intervention , and what does this account teach us about Jehovah ?
( Read Exodus 14 : 19 , 20 . )
This no doubt took considerable time , for the account says : “ At length the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry land . ”
Compared with Pharaoh’s military forces in their war chariots , the Israelites moved at a ponderous pace .
Yet , there was no possibility that the Egyptians would overtake them , for Jehovah was fighting for Israel .
“ Not so much as one among them was let remain . ”
ESCAPING JERUSALEM’S DESTRUCTION
Jesus said : “ When you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation , as spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in a holy place , . . . then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains . ”
But how would they get out of a city that was under siege ?
( Read Matthew 24 : 17 , 18 . )
Conditions within the city rapidly deteriorated as rival Jewish factions struggled for control .
What does Habakkuk’s prophecy reveal about the coming attack on God’s people ?
In a related prophecy , Habakkuk said : “ I heard , and my belly began to be agitated ; at the sound my lips quivered ; rottenness began to enter into my bones ; and in my situation I was agitated , that I should quietly wait for the day of distress , for his [ God’s ] coming up to the people [ the menacing armies ] , that he may raid them . ”
Yet , the prophet was willing to wait quietly for Jehovah’s great day , trusting that Jehovah would deliver his people .
To share in that glorious triumph , however , we must remain faithful to the end .
That is the subject of the next article .
See The Watchtower , December 15 , 2010 , pages 30 - 31 .
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
How does Jehovah provide us with encouragement ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What assurance do we have that God will help us to keep our integrity ?
Does God really know us that well ?
The Scriptures reveal that Jehovah knows each of us intimately .
He is collecting together in true worship “ the desirable things of all the nations , ” and he is helping his servants to maintain their integrity .
Those words imply that to become a disciple of Christ , we must have God’s help .
How were all of us drawn by God to true worship ?
If you are a dedicated Christian , you too were drawn by God to true worship .
Because we all need God’s help to remain faithful to him .
This is illustrated by an incident that took place in the life of David .
Recognizing Jehovah’s hand in the matter , David said to her : “ Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , who has sent you this day to meet me !
What lesson can we learn from this account ?
Note how those questions are answered in the book of Revelation .
To what extent is Jehovah aware of what is taking place in the congregations of his people ?
In the fulfillment of the vision , the seven congregations represent anointed Christians after 1914 , and the counsel given to the seven congregations applies in principle to all the congregations of God’s people today earth wide .
How can we allow Jehovah to guide our steps ?
To benefit from it , however , we must take the time to study it and apply what we learn .
Have you ever studied something in our literature that seems to have been written just for you ?
( Read Psalm 34 : 18 ; 56 : 8 . )
When we are “ broken at heart ” or “ crushed in spirit , ” he draws near to us .
What lesson can we learn from Asaph’s experience ?
One benefit of attending meetings is illustrated by the experience of the psalmist Asaph .
What helped Asaph to regain his balance ?
The stress of dealing with the injustices of Satan’s world can wear us down .
Meeting together with our brothers refreshes us and helps us retain our joy in serving Jehovah .
How can we benefit from the example of Hannah ?
Recall that she was sorely vexed over a family situation involving her rival wife , Peninnah .
It was so distressing to Hannah that “ she would weep and not eat . ”
Jehovah took notice of her faithfulness and blessed her . ​ — 1 Sam .
1 : 11 , 20 .
( b ) How do you feel about the tender care Jehovah provides to help us attain salvation ?
Christians today have good reason for imitating Hannah’s example .

THE Jewish man symbolizes anointed Christians , and the “ ten men ” represent the “ other sheep , ” or “ Jonadabs , ” as they were known back then .
I was born on October 15 , 1926 .
That convention convinced me that it was my duty as a Jonadab to help the anointed class to the best of my ability in the preaching work .
PIONEER SERVICE DURING THE WAR
Mother was my first pioneer partner , but after about a year , she had to relinquish her pioneer service for health reasons .
Even so , our years of pioneering in Kent were happy ones .
At the end of those weeks , Pryce Hughes , the branch servant , asked me to stay at Bethel .
2 : 9 .
One day at Bethel , a brother told me that there was a sister at the front door who wanted to see me .
One of my fellow students , Lloyd Barry ; one of the instructors , Albert Schroeder ; and John Booth , overseer of Kingdom Farm ( where Gilead School was located ) later became members of the Governing Body .
CIRCUIT WORK AND BACK TO BETHEL
I was only 21 years of age , but the brothers accepted with warmth my youthful enthusiasm .
My mother died in February 1950 .
Dad was later appointed as a servant in the Gillingham Congregation .
The convention was held in the Palais des sports , near the Eiffel Tower .
After our wedding , Esther and I lived outside Bethel .
In 1964 we were invited to live at Bethel .
I have had the privilege of periodically returning to world headquarters in New York .
During those visits , I received good advice from different members of the Governing Body .
For example , one time when I expressed my concern about meeting a certain deadline for work , Brother Knorr smiled and said : “ Don’t worry .
Many times since then , when assignments pile up , instead of panicking , I set to work on one job after another and the work gets done , generally on time .
We other sheep are also aware that we will not always have Christ’s anointed brothers among us on earth .

( Left ) With Esther on our wedding day
We need to avoid gradually developing wrong attitudes or tendencies . ​ — 12 / 15 , pages 10 - 12 .
Yet Sarah cooperated , trusting that God would bless her .
In Jesus ’ parable about “ the wheat ” and “ the weeds , ” “ the fine seed ” meant “ the sons of the kingdom . ”
The weeds would grow alongside the wheat until the harvest .
What events will lead directly to Armageddon ?
When giving advice , what principles should we keep in mind ?
I lost all trust in her .
Words cannot describe how difficult it was for me to forgive her . ”
How can you rebuild trust ?
At first , you and your mate may be too upset to discuss the infidelity .
Steve says , “ Because Jodi didn’t want to talk about the infidelity , I remained suspicious . ”
In retrospect , Jodi acknowledges , “ Not discussing it with my husband hindered the healing process . ”
Without a doubt , any discussion about the betrayal will be painful .
How ?
What did they talk about ?
But we always apologized to each other later .
By avoiding such speech , you will encourage your spouse to continue talking openly to you . ​ — Ephesians 4 : 32 .
That is what Steve and Jodi found .
I was determined never to cause him such pain again .
Each day , I looked for ways to reassure him of my loyalty , and he continually showed his love for me .
Paul was so determined to rebuild trust with his wife that he left his job .
He also got rid of his cell phone and used only his wife’s phone .
If you are the guilty mate , you may also need to make changes to your personality .
Steve recalls : “ Jodi would often show affection with a touch of her hand , and she regularly said ‘ I love you . ’ ”
List them , and then put them into practice .
Proverbs 21 : 5 cautions : “ Everyone that is hasty surely heads for want . ”
Forgiveness ​ — and trust — ​ are likely to come gradually .
Also encourage your mate to share his or her joys and concerns .
When his people returned to him in genuine repentance , he forgave them .
In times of uncertainty , remember this : God is the Originator of the marriage arrangement .
It has now been more than 20 years since the crisis in Steve and Jodi’s relationship .

What Is the Good News About Religion ?
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you .
Nevertheless , Jehovah God wants people to know the truth about him . ​ — Read 1 Timothy 2 : 3 - 5 .
What is the good news about religion ?
We gain friendship with God , a new and loving “ family , ” and the prospect of having everlasting life . ​ — Read Mark 10 : 29 , 30 ; 2 Corinthians 6 : 17 , 18 .
For more information , see chapters 15 and 16 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Draw Close to God
He publicly approached Zedekiah and protested the unjust treatment of Jeremiah .
He took “ worn - out rags and worn - out pieces of cloth and let them down to Jeremiah . . . by means of the ropes . ”
Why the rags and cloth ?
Did He appreciate it ?

Do You Really Appreciate God’s Gift of Marriage ?
“ May Jehovah make a gift to you , and do you find a resting - place each one in the house of her husband . ” ​ — RUTH 1 : 9 .
No wonder he waxed poetic !
God united the two in happy wedlock .
In present - day society , many make their own choice of marriage mate .
She said : “ I have put you under oath , O daughters of Jerusalem , that you try not to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined . ”
They truly loved each other .
Your daughter you must not give to his son , and his daughter you must not take for your son .
If a dedicated servant of Jehovah married an unbeliever , this would be an act of disobedience to God .
Explain why we should follow God’s guidance on marriage .
Well , if we are to fulfill a desire for happy wedlock , we must follow the instructions provided by Jehovah , the Maker of marriage .
Why can we say that Jehovah understands feelings of loneliness as well as the happiness possible in marriage ?
He implanted a sexual need in humans so that they would “ be fruitful and become many . ”
Among Jehovah’s servants , however , wedlock can result in true happiness if God’s Word is followed .
For instance , consider Paul’s clear counsel on intimate relations in marriage .
And , of course , they should avoid any actions that would displease Jehovah .
Especially should a Christian home be a place of rest and peace .
What blessings she received for doing things Jehovah’s way !
Where can one find sound counsel on wedlock ?
No human knows as much .
They will if they really appreciate his gift of marriage .
A husband’s prayers can be hindered if he does not apply Jehovah’s counsel .
A loving wife can have what influence on family life ?
It is natural for a God - fearing husband to love his wife and protect her physically and spiritually .
19 : 10 - 12 ; 1 Cor .
7 : 1 , 6 , 7 , 17 .

It is vital to correct such thinking and suppress the sinful yearning of a treacherous heart . ​ — Jer .
How do you feel that we ought to view God’s gift of marriage ?
Take a Positive View of a Strained Marriage
7 : 10 .
WHEN Christians get married , they make a vow before God ​ — a responsibility not to be taken lightly .
Servants of Jehovah should view marriage as a binding arrangement whether they were his worshippers at the time of their wedding or not .
If that is your experience , pray for God’s forgiveness and help .
If a Christian were to get a divorce , he or she may or may not be Scripturally free to get married again .
Jesus said : “ Whoever divorces his wife , except on the ground of fornication , and marries another commits adultery . ”
A failed marriage may cast doubt on one’s spiritual state .
2 : 21 - 24 .
Many marriages that seemed to be headed for failure have in time turned out to be very successful .
Consider what can happen in a religiously divided household .
10 , 11 .

What should a Christian do if his or her marriage bond seems hopelessly frayed for such a reason ?
Yet , there are sound reasons for not giving up on a marital bond that is weakening .
The godly man or woman who endures the trials of a difficult marriage for the sake of conscience is precious to God .
Their loving regard for you will increase as they see that you earnestly desire to please God .
When asked for help by Christians living in religiously divided households , elders refer to such counsel as that of Paul , who wrote : “ To the married people I give instructions , yet not I but the Lord , that a wife should not depart from her husband ; but if she should actually depart , let her remain unmarried or else make up again with her husband ; and a husband should not leave his wife . . . .
Others have done so because of extreme physical abuse or the absolute endangerment of a Christian’s spirituality .
What should restrain Christians from making hasty decisions regarding divorce ?
Surely , then , we would never scheme to get out of one marriage while our heart is planning on another marriage . ​ — Jer .
2 : 13 - 16 .
HOPE IN JEHOVAH
“ I was tempted to separate from my husband because of financial nonsupport and spiritual endangerment , ” she says .
“ Yet , my husband served as an elder before he got involved in some unwise business arrangements .
A terrorist attack in our city frightened me so much that I withdrew into a shell .
Above all , may we be determined to please Jehovah God in all things and show real appreciation for his wonderful gift of marriage .

Trust in Jehovah ​ — The God of “ Times and Seasons ”
How do creation and fulfilled prophecy show that Jehovah is the Great Timekeeper ?
On the fourth creative day , God said : “ Let luminaries come to be in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night ; and they must serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years . ”
In harmony with Jehovah’s will , that is , of course , what took place .
Until now , however , scientists have debated the nature of time .
CREATION INSPIRES FAITH IN THE GREAT TIMEKEEPER
Humans too have internal clocks , usually governed by the 24 - hour cycle of day and night .
Moreover , what the Scriptures foretell happens on time because Jehovah God can cause events to take place according to his purpose and timetable .
Seeing how prophecies were fulfilled at specified times should inspire faith in the God of “ times and seasons ” and in his Word .
Babylonian armies destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E . , and Jews from Judah were indeed deported to Babylon .
But what was to happen at the end of 70 years ?
This prophecy was fulfilled right on time ​ — in 537 B.C.E . after the Medes and Persians freed the Jews from Babylon .
About two years before the Jews left Babylon , God foretold through the prophet Daniel that the Messiah would appear 483 years after the order to rebuild Jerusalem was given .
The Medo - Persian king gave that order in 455 B.C.E .
Exactly 483 years later ​ — in 29 C.E . ​ — Jesus of Nazareth was anointed by holy spirit at his baptism and thus became the Messiah .
In part , the Bible did so by giving “ the sign ” of Jesus ’ presence , pointing to the time when Satan would be cast out of heaven , which would result in great woe for the earth .
It will be followed by his Thousand Year Reign .
Knowing that we are living in the time of the end should have what effect on us ?
How should recognizing that Kingdom rule has begun and that we are living in “ the time of the end ” affect us ?
It had been foretold that the world of that time would come to an end .
At that time , wicked humans would drown in the waters of a global deluge .
But they were “ eating and drinking , men marrying and women being given in marriage , . . . and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away . ”
What will help us to keep ourselves ready ?
Remembering what about Jehovah will help us to serve him faithfully while we await the coming of the Son of man ?
In fact , Proverbs 21 : 1 tells us : “ A king’s heart is as streams of water in the hand of Jehovah .
Jehovah can influence events in order to accomplish his purpose and fulfill it on time . Many of the momentous changes in the world have been fulfilling prophecy , particularly in regard to the global preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom .
Continuing in the Kingdom - preaching work in these last days requires faith in Jehovah’s timing .
We demonstrate faith in the God of “ times and seasons ” by fully cooperating with such adjustments as we serve loyally under his Son , the “ head of the congregation . ” ​ — Eph .
Jehovah wants us to pray to him freely with complete confidence that he will provide needed “ help at the right time . ”
Does that not demonstrate his loving concern for us as individuals ?
17 , 18 . ( a ) What action will Jehovah soon take against his enemies ?
( b ) We must avoid what snare ?
4 : 10 ; 2 Pet .
Soon , Jehovah will bring an end to this wicked system of things .
Indeed , “ be courageous , and may your heart be strong , all you who are waiting for Jehovah . ” ​ — Ps .
31 : 24 .

See Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy !
Why is it reasonable to expect that we can imitate Jehovah’s qualities ?
Anointed Christians reflect Jehovah’s glory .
The spirit - begotten apostle Paul therefore wrote : “ All of us , while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory . ”
Are you reflecting Jehovah’s glory by your godly conduct and by your activity as a regular Kingdom proclaimer ?
WE DESIRE TO REFLECT JEHOVAH’S GLORY
Paul had to contend with that problem personally .
Explaining why we have such a struggle , Paul wrote : “ All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ”
Sin mars a person’s relationship with God .
Thus , mankind in general is completely out of harmony with Jehovah and misses the priceless opportunity to reflect God’s glory .
Unquestionably , sin is the worst disability afflicting humankind .
As worshippers of Jehovah , we must continually make a self - examination to determine whether we are measuring up to his righteous standards .
Although we are not perfect as Jesus was , we can and should strive to follow his example .
What role does the Bible play in the lives of Christians who desire to measure up to God’s requirements ?
Reading the Scriptures daily will help us to make improvement .
Bible knowledge is the basis for our faith and is the means of fortifying our determination to avoid grave sin and to please Jehovah . ​ — Ps .
86 : 12 ; Jas .
Striving to live in any other way is dishonoring to him and damaging to us .
This should be the case even if he is a family member .
In fact , it is spiritually dangerous and improper to peruse their information , whether it appears in written form or it is found on the Internet . ​ — Read Isaiah 5 : 20 ; Matthew 7 : 6 .
Displaying love is an outstanding way for us to imitate our heavenly Father .

As told by Elva Gjerde
Let me explain .
He even began to control his temper .
This prompted my mother and older brother , Frank , to start attending meetings .
Since then , many older ones have influenced me in a positive way during various stages of my life .
One of them was Alice Place , the elderly sister who had first called on our family .
You see , I loved mathematics , and I had my heart set on teaching math .
Percy and Madge had served as missionaries in Latvia during the 1930 ’ s .
When World War II broke out in Europe , they were invited to serve at the Australia Bethel , located in an inner suburb of Sydney .
One of my first Bible students was Betty Law ( now Remnant ) .
Upon receiving a special pioneer assignment , I moved to Narrandera ​ — a town 137 miles ( 220 km ) southwest of Cowra .
We were the only Witnesses in town .
More than 300 were in attendance at that meeting held in a large tent .
Nathan Knorr from Brooklyn Bethel addressed the group and spelled out the urgent need to carry the good news to every corner of the earth . We hung on to every word he said .
I was young and idealistic and tended to expect perfection from myself as well as others .
Some of my classmates also helped me .
I recall one of them saying : “ Elva , Jehovah is not up there using a whip .
Don’t be so strict with yourself ! ”
After spending a year in Namibia , I joined my fiancé in Switzerland .
Soon thereafter , I received a terrible shock . I discovered that my husband had been unfaithful to me and to Jehovah .
I determined that I would never allow my husband’s mistakes to separate me from Jehovah .
During the ocean voyage home , I enjoyed regular lively Bible discussions with a group of fellow passengers .
For a while he progressed well ; then his condition deteriorated and he suffered a stroke .
He eventually returned home , where I slowly nursed him back to health .
During those study sessions , I discovered much wise advice on how to cope with my situation .
I also received loving visits from older ones in our congregation ​ — some of whom had endured similar trials .
When I was young , I was idealistic .
But I found out that life seldom turns out the way we expect .
Along the way , I have drawn guidance and comfort from several sources .
His counsel has molded my personality , and it led me to rewarding experiences in the missionary work .

Caring for Arne when he was ill
How is the death of God’s loyal ones “ precious in the eyes of Jehovah ” ?
God’s position and reputation would be called into question were he to allow his enemies to wipe out the entire group of his people on earth .
Indeed , “ Jehovah will not forsake his people , nor will he leave his own inheritance . ” ​ — Ps .
This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah , and their righteousness is from me . ” ​ — Isa .
[ Blurb on page 22 ]
“ Watch Out for the Leaven of the Pharisees ”
A parallel account of Jesus ’ words makes it clear that he was condemning “ the teaching ” of the Pharisees . ​ — Matt .
Why was the Pharisees ’ teaching dangerous ?
This self - righteousness figures in one of Jesus ’ parables .
Although tax collectors had a reputation for dishonesty , Jesus sought to help those among them who listened to him .
We should quickly dismiss such thoughts , for the Scriptures say : “ Love is patient ; love is kind and envies no one .
On another occasion , Jesus washed the feet of his disciples , thereby setting a pattern of humility for his followers . ​ — John 13 : 1 - 15 .
Questions for meditation :
Do I tend to favor those who have positions of responsibility in the congregation , perhaps with the hope of gaining prominence or additional privileges ?
The Pharisees sought to fill in such supposed gaps by means of their laws , definitions , and traditions .
Questions for meditation :
If so , why not resolve to do so ?
23 : 2 , 5
Additionally , advertisements had been placed in newspapers .
* In 1881 , Zion’s Watch Tower had called for 1,000 preachers who could distribute Bible literature full - time .
Most of them lived on the small reimbursement they received for each Watch Tower subscription or book they placed .
Who were these intrepid colporteurs ?
Regular colporteurs worked long days , and auxiliary colporteurs put in one or two hours daily .
Where cash was scarce , colporteurs bartered books for food .
Brother Russell once urged hardworking preachers to have a hearty breakfast , a midmorning glass of milk , and on a hot day , an ice - cream soda .
The Lord would appreciate either , he was told , but giving his time to the Lord directly would bring him greater blessings .

Draw Close to God

Jeremiah wrote Lamentations at a low point in Israel’s history .
Listen as Jeremiah speaks representatively for his people .
Amid the sorrow , Jeremiah is filled with hope .
He cries out to Jehovah : “ Without fail your soul * [ Jehovah himself ] will remember and bow low over me . ”
Those words evoke a tender mental picture .
▪ Jeremiah 51 - 52 ; Lamentations 1 - 5 – Ezekiel 1 - 5
[ Blurb on page 14 ]
Jehovah is willing to come down to our level , as it were , to help us when we are low
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible .
In English , God’s personal name is Jehovah . ​ — Read Isaiah 42 : 8 .
Although many Bible translators have replaced God’s name with such terms as “ God ” and “ Lord , ” that name is found nearly 7,000 times in ancient Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible .
Clearly , God wants his name to be known . ​ — Read Isaiah 12 : 4 .
The faith of people who know and use God’s name moves them to trust in him and to put him first in their life .
Why does God want his name to be known ?
No wonder Jehovah wants us to make his name known ! ​ — Read John 17 : 3 ; Romans 10 : 13 , 14 .
They do so as a united “ people for [ God’s ] name . ” ​ — Read Acts 15 : 14 ; John 17 : 26 .
What should you do ?
All of this came to an end when he lost his job because of reduced clientele at the hotel .
Among the many benefits that came with his job were a big house , a car , house servants , and prestigious schools for his children .
Faced with decreased or lost income , we can easily be overwhelmed by negative thoughts .
Consider Jesus ’ words found at Luke 14 : 28 : “ Who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense , to see if he has enough to complete it ? ”
A Bible proverb states : “ A shrewd man sees trouble coming and lies low . ”
Could you benefit from a similar outlook ?
Our lot could perhaps be better , but in these changing times , it could also be much worse .
True happiness does not come from amassing everything that we might want or from living a life of ease and affluence .
Our Creator , Jehovah God , is very much aware of all our needs .
Of course , the result will not be a sudden or dramatic improvement in a person’s financial situation .
Teach Your Children
You may have thought about it later and were sorry you disobeyed .
When Naaman hears of this , right away he wants to go to Elisha .
How do you think Naaman feels about this ? —
He is angry .
Naaman starts to leave .
Do you know what ? — ‘ Let me have two muleloads of soil to take home . ’
He is stubborn no more but is willing to obey the true God .
You can accept help and not be stubborn anymore .

Life Story

When Jehovah’s Witnesses started studying the Bible with Oly’s mother in 1982 , Oly and I were already engaged .
So we set about learning the dialect spoken in our new assignment , and that helped us to be more readily accepted in the community .
Initially , I gave a public talk every Sunday , after which Oly would dutifully clap . We were the only ones present .
We recalled some good advice from a fellow Witness : “ Tell Jehovah about your problems .
To reach congregations and isolated groups , we traveled on foot , sometimes up to 90 miles ( 145 km ) through densely forested mountains .
Oly carried the slide projector , while I lugged a 12 - volt car battery .
Sometimes we asked total strangers to let us stay overnight .
After finding accommodations , we would begin to prepare a meal .
Everything took time .
After the meal , we fetched more water for bathing .
Sometimes we slept in the kitchen .
VISITING ISOLATED GROUPS
The response came , “ Yeah ! ”
In 1996 we were reassigned to a circuit closer to Antananarivo , in the central highlands .
We were scheduled to visit a group at Beankàna ( Besakay ) , about 150 miles ( 240 km ) from Antananarivo .
It was a week before a vehicle came by , and we resumed our journey .
In the wee hours of the morning , we arrived at a small village , where we got off .
That was our first visit to the area , so we decided to witness to some who were working in the rice fields and to ask for directions to where the local Witnesses lived .
How delighted we were to discover that those workers were , in fact , our spiritual brothers !
Later , he and his wife began in the circuit work .
One serves as a circuit overseer , and the other is a Kingdom Hall construction volunteer .
True , we sometimes feel tired and become ill , yet we are happy when we reflect on the results of our ministry .

We know the answer ​ — it has been disclosed to us by the “ Revealer of secrets , ” Jehovah God .
He enables us to discern the identity of those governments through the writings of the prophet Daniel and the apostle John .
16 : 20 .
All those who imitate Satan’s hatred of God and oppose God’s people .
Why is this fact significant ? Because it explains why the visions of Daniel and John describe a total of only eight such great powers .
John also saw a strange beast rise from that sea and receive great authority from the Devil .
Let us consider each of the heads of the beast described in Revelation .
We will also see how the writings of Daniel added detailed insights into many of these kingdoms , sometimes centuries before they came into existence .
EGYPT AND ASSYRIA ​ — THE FIRST TWO HEADS
Because Egypt was the first major power to express enmity toward God’s people .
By motivating Pharaoh to execute all male Israelite children .
19 : 32 - 35 ; Isa .
10 : 5 , 6 , 12 - 15 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What did Jehovah allow the Babylonians to do ?
How would that challenge be overcome ?
The prophet Daniel was among the captives taken to Babylon .
For instance , he caused Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar to have a dream of an immense image that was made of various metals .
* The world power after Babylon is pictured by the breasts and arms of silver .
Jehovah used the Medo - Persian Empire to fulfill prophecy by overthrowing Babylon and restoring the Israelites to their homeland .
It was only due to Jehovah’s intervention that His people were once again protected from the animosity of Satan’s seed .
The fifth head of the wild beast of Revelation represents Greece .

Daniel further recorded that the large horn would be broken and four smaller horns would grow in its place .
They were still God’s chosen people , and the rebuilt temple was still the center for true worship .
However , in the second century B.C.E . , Greece , the fifth head of the wild beast , attacked God’s people .
Antiochus IV , one of the heirs to Alexander’s divided empire , placed a pagan altar on the grounds of the temple in Jerusalem and made practicing the Jewish religion a crime punishable by death .
Soon , though , Greece was supplanted as the world power .
( a ) What new nation did Jehovah choose , and why ?
He now chose a new nation , “ the Israel of God . ”
That nation was the congregation of anointed Christians made up of both Jews and Gentiles .
*
( b ) What will another article consider ?
( Read Daniel 7 : 7 , 8 . )
The article on page 14 will consider the answers .
This woman represents Jehovah’s wifelike organization that is made up of spirit creatures in heaven . ​ — Isa .
54 : 1 ; Gal .
How do Daniel and John portray the end of human rulership ?
Let us address John’s vision of the wild beast .
Rome , the sixth head , remained a dominant political force for centuries after John wrote down his vision .
4 , 5 . ( a ) What did the small horn do ?
But it had not yet become the seventh head of the wild beast .
Though Britain gained dominance , colonies in North America broke away .
How did this head treat the seed of the woman ?
The seventh head of the wild beast as much as killed the preaching work for a period of time .
Britain ​ — and by extension , the United States — ​ grew out of the Roman Empire .
For example , it proved its power by winning World War I .
Jehovah’s servants have long sought to understand the symbolic meaning of the feet of the image .
Daniel 2 : 41 describes the mixture of iron and clay as one “ kingdom , ” not many .
The common people undermine the ability of the Anglo - American World Power to act with ironlike strength .
3 : 1 - 3 .
( b ) What can we conclude about the number of toes ?
Does the number of toes of the image have special meaning ?
Those numbers are significant .
However , when describing the image , Daniel does not mention the number of toes .
From his description , we can conclude that the Anglo - American World Power is the one that will be dominating when the “ stone ” representing God’s Kingdom hits the feet of the image . ​ — Dan .
12 , 13 .
The two - horned wild beast represents what , and what does it do ?
What does this strange beast represent ?
It has two horns , so it is a dual power .
Any power it has comes from its member nations , especially from its key backer , the Anglo - American World Power .
15 , 16 .
In fact , many people believe that religion contributes to or causes conflict .
The harlot will remain a potent force , attempting to bend kings to her will until God plants an idea in the hearts of those in power .
Soon Jehovah will cause the political elements of Satan’s system , as represented by the United Nations , to attack false religion .
We are living in the days of the seventh head .
Although the components of the dual world power have existed since the 18th century , John describes it as it would appear at the start of the Lord’s day .
In fact , the fulfillment of the visions recorded in Revelation takes place during “ the Lord’s day . ”
Daniel foresaw the terrible destruction this king would cause during that war , writing : “ In a wonderful [ awful ] way he will cause ruin . ”
See Revelation ​ — Its Grand Climax at Hand ! pages 240 , 241 , 253 .
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
It is as if you are saying : ‘ Jehovah , I want you to be my Master in every aspect of my life .
I am your servant .
What , though , does your recognizing Jehovah as your Master imply as to the way you use your time ?
28 : 19 , 20 ; 2 Tim .
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 5 . )
Next , let us look at the example of Moses .
Because of the training that he received from his real parents early in life , Moses likely knew what Jehovah had promised his ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
Moses chose “ to be ill - treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin . ”
( Read Hebrews 11 : 24 - 26 . )
Indeed , that nation was soon thereafter crushed by ten plagues from God .
Jehovah commissioned Jeremiah as his prophet to preach a message of judgment on apostate Jerusalem and Judah .
Do not keep on seeking .
Do you see in that a lesson for us ?
Granted , Jehovah’s organization continues to plan for new Kingdom Halls , branch facilities , and other theocratic projects .
“ I CONSIDER THEM AS A LOT OF REFUSE ”
10 , 11 . ( a ) On what had Paul centered his efforts prior to becoming a Christian ?
Finally , let us consider the example of Paul .
Yet , all of that changed when Paul realized that Jehovah was no longer blessing the Jews as a nation .
Paul recognized that a career in the Jewish system had no value from Jehovah’s point of view ; it had no future .
They should not feel bad about this .

16 , 17 .
If you do not feel motivated to expand your ministry , ask Jehovah to give you both the desire and the ability to do so . ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 9 , 11 .
Noah , Moses , Jeremiah , Paul , and Jesus were all devoted men .
The end of the present system of things is imminent ; hence , all of us who have dedicated our lives to God need to be sure that we are continuing to do our utmost in following these excellent Scriptural examples .

People gave no heed to Noah’s warning
How was God’s message transmitted by holy spirit to Bible writers ?
Why are we here ?
Why is the world the way it is ?
Doing so should stimulate us to read from God’s Word daily and to apply its counsel . ​ — Heb .
How were the prophets and Bible writers “ borne along by holy spirit ” ?
* Acts 27 : 15 uses it in describing a boat that was seized and moved , or driven along a certain course , by the wind .
3 : 16 .
30 : 2 .
How is God’s wisdom made evident in his use of humans to write the Bible ?

Could they have conveyed with a human touch such emotions as fear , sorrow , and disappointment , so common to mankind ?
Buddha himself did not claim to be a god , and he said very little about God .
The texts of Confucianism are an amalgam of records of events , moral rules , magical formulas , and songs .
Granted , the holy book of Islam teaches belief in one God and presents him as God who is omniscient and has foreknowledge , but it does not even reveal the name of God , Jehovah , which appears thousands of times in the Bible .
It helps us to see the many facets of his personality .


In a sense , the availability of the Bible testifies to this truth .
‘ From time indefinite to time indefinite Jehovah is God . ’
So think of all of his accomplishments !
The Bible alone acquaints us with God’s activities both past and present and reveals what he will do in the future .
No wonder that applying Scriptural counsel on marriage , children , entertainment , association , industriousness , honesty , and morality brings superior results !
The Bible has survived what efforts over the centuries ?
We can point to what evidence of the Bible’s inspiration ?
( b ) What evidence of divine inspiration of the Bible do you like to use in the ministry ?
However , being a curious person by nature , I agreed to a Bible study . ”
Years later , he moved to Europe , where he resumed his Bible study and came to this conclusion : “ The fulfillment of Bible prophecies , the internal harmony of the Holy Scriptures , the absence of contradiction in the Bible , and the love among Jehovah’s worshippers convinced me that the Bible is God’s Word . ”
She continues : “ When Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on my door , however , my life took a 180 degree turn . ”
Asha studied the Bible and came to know God as her Friend .
Paula was reared a Catholic , but by the time she was a young adult , she considered herself an agnostic .
He said that he had been studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and proceeded to witness to me . ”
The Bible is a marvelous gift that Jehovah has provided by means of his holy spirit .
Peer into the Scriptures as you would into a mirror .
As you do so , be grateful that the prophets and men who were used to pen the message of the Bible truly were “ borne along by holy spirit . ”

Questions From Readers
When did the Anglo - American World Power become the seventh world power of Bible prophecy ?
▪ The giant metal image seen by King Nebuchadnezzar does not represent all world powers .
* That description indicates that the Anglo - American World Power would emerge from the legs of iron .
History bears out the accuracy of that description .
This occurred during World War I .
Members of the anointed class were actively preaching in countries dominated by the British Empire .

The clay that is mixed with iron represents elements within the realm of the ironlike Anglo - American World Power .
Many have experienced shipwreck in the stormy waters of life .
It was an art usually learned at the feet of longtime sailors , perhaps a helmsman .
The Hebrew term rendered “ skillful direction ” can describe the actions of the commander of an ancient ship .
As Proverbs indicates , we have to let “ wisdom , ” “ understanding , ” and “ insight ” work together .
And we cannot neglect seeking divine guidance , for even the wicked may know how to ‘ steer ’ for unjust ends . ​ — Prov .
We receive much wise counsel at Christian meetings .
23 : 22 .
We read : “ By skillful direction [ “ by skillful strategy , ” The Revised English Bible ] you will carry on your war , and in the multitude of counselors there is salvation . ” ​ — Prov .
Loretta , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , had a good job at a food - preparation company .
He was inspired to write : “ It will turn out well with those fearing the true God , because they were in fear of him . ”
To emphasize their role , pilots were often portrayed larger than other sailors
Kindness Melts Bitterness
Although they tried at different times , they did not find her again .
They even began to think that she was avoiding them .
One day , George finally found Rie at home .
Her health did not allow her to attend congregation meetings very often , yet she delighted in having brothers and sisters visit her .
In it , she described the misery of loneliness in old age and stressed the importance of kindness .
Jehovah has surrounded himself with millions of loyal angels . ​ — Read Psalm 103 : 20 , 21 ; Daniel 7 : 9 , 10 .
Some people considered the warning a joke and ignored it .
It comes from God through angels . ​ — Read Revelation 1 : 1 ; 14 : 6 , 7 .
That will bring delightful relief to mankind . ​ — Read 2 Thessalonians 1 : 6 - 8 .
Satan has used corrupt businesses , human governments , and false religions to influence people and to turn them away from God .
Thus , Satan is responsible for the injustice , violence , and suffering that afflict mankind . ​ — Read 1 John 5 : 19 .
But demons often deceive people by imitating the voice of dead loved ones .
God’s Word warns us to avoid all such practices .
So we should discard anything in our possession that is related to the demons and the occult . ​ — Read Deuteronomy 18 : 10 , 11 ; Acts 19 : 19 .
Jehovah foretold the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians .
“ All his transgressions that he has committed ​ — they will not be remembered against him , ” Jehovah explained .
Why is this significant ?
Does God’s mercy move you to want to draw closer to him ?
Similarly , “ to remember sins ” can mean “ to take action against sinners . ” ​ — Jeremiah 14 : 10 .
▪ God’s Law to the nation of Israel included this command concerning the people of the nations around them : “ You must form no marriage alliance with them .
Consider the example of King Solomon .
He knew Jehovah’s warning about unbelieving wives : “ They will incline your heart to follow their gods . ”
What a tragedy !
Mahlon is not commended for marrying a Moabite girl ; he died young , likely even before Ruth called Jehovah her God .
Mahlon’s brother , Chilion , married the Moabitess Orpah , who remained attached to “ her gods . ”
In fact , the Jews later regarded her as a “ perfect proselyte . ”
Is it wise , then , to reason that an example such as that of Mahlon and Ruth somehow argues against Jehovah’s counsel to marry only fellow believers ?
For those already married to unbelievers , the Bible offers helpful counsel on how to make the best of a challenging situation .

“ One Jehovah ” Gathers His Family
Jehovah wants all his intelligent creatures to enjoy the greatest measure of freedom possible .
In these articles , see how he is teaching us to be a free people .
Why are we courageously forging ahead with our preaching activity despite opposition and worsening economic conditions ?
Examining portions of Paul’s letter to the Ephesians will help us to understand the purpose of this administration and to work in harmony with it .

32 “ My Dream Has Come True ”
A YOUNG brother in Italy was under pressure .
He had just graduated from high school with the highest grades in his class , and now relatives and teachers were urging him to pursue higher education .
But I honestly added in my prayer that I wanted , not a dull life , but one filled with a variety of activities in his service . ”
A few years later , Bruno found himself in Ecuador , South America .
The city has over 75,000 inhabitants but only one congregation .
I’m greatly enjoying my ministry . ”
THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED
Of course , serving in a foreign country presents significant challenges .
Even so , Kayla decided to move .
I had to learn to be patient , study the language diligently , and laugh at myself when I made mistakes . ”
Anna from Estonia adds : “ Getting used to the tropical heat , lots of dust , and a lack of hot showers was nothing compared to learning Spanish .
Likely , they will not be the same as what you are accustomed to .
Beau from Canada tells us : “ In your home country , you take for granted such basic services as electricity and running water .
“ Most of all , they have a huge interest in learning more about God . ”
“ A BLESSING UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE WANT ”
Here is how they feel about their ministry :
Later , I helped with the expansion of the Ecuador branch office .

Let Jehovah Lead You to True Freedom
What is the secret to gaining true freedom ?
Nevertheless , we have the hope of seeing an end to mankind’s enslavement to sin and corruption and of enjoying what the Bible calls “ the glorious freedom of the children of God . ”
In what way ?
Other Bible versions render this phrase “ the law that makes us free ” ( The New English Bible ) and “ the perfect law of freedom ” ( The New American Bible ) .
What is “ the perfect law that belongs to freedom , ” and who benefit from it ?
He had in mind “ the law of the Christ , ” also called “ the law of faith ” and “ the law of a free people . ”
Unlike the law codes of many countries , “ the perfect law ” is neither complex nor burdensome but consists of simple commandments and basic principles .
Rather , they appreciate them , recognizing that natural laws are essential for their welfare .
In other words , we have to learn to love what Jehovah loves and to hate what he hates , which the law of freedom helps us to do . ​ — Amos 5 : 15 .
Illustrate .
In our imperfect state , we struggle to subdue wrong desires .
When he learned that his habit displeased God , he had to make a decision .
Wisely , he chose to serve God , even though his flesh ached for nicotine .
Jay learned by experience that the world’s freedoms , which allow people to ‘ mind the flesh , ’ actually enslave , whereas Jehovah’s freedoms , which mean “ the minding of the spirit , ” set free and lead to “ life and peace . ”
PEER INTO GOD’S WORD
What does it mean to “ peer ” into God’s law ?
Yes , if we want the law of freedom to affect our mind and heart , we must do our part by diligently studying the Bible and prayerfully meditating on what we read . ​ — 1 Tim .
4 : 15 .
At the same time , we must ‘ persist , ’ or endure , in applying God’s Word , thus making the truth our way of life .
To “ know , ” says one reference , here means also to have appreciation because “ what is ‘ known ’ is of value or importance to the one who knows . ”
Thus , we “ know ” the truth in the fullest sense when we make it our way of life .
Then we can rightly say that “ the word of God ” is “ at work ” in us , molding our personality so that we more closely reflect our heavenly Father . ​ — 1 Thess .
Have I made it my way of life ?
I never believed that what I did mattered to him .
And I never learned to go to him when I was in trouble .
I leaned on my own understanding , which I now know was ridiculous because I knew nothing . ”
The reality , however , is quite the opposite .
15 , 16 .
How important is our association with the congregation , and what freedom do we enjoy ?
When you began associating with the Christian congregation , you did not join some sort of social club .
As a result , you have the privilege of being among the only people in the world who can rightly be called “ a free people . ” ​ — Jas .
Consider this : When you are in the company of those who love Jehovah with all their heart , do you feel afraid ?
Do you find yourself constantly glancing over your shoulder ?
Would you feel that way at a secular event ?
Not likely !
What a relief that will be !
But as we shall see in the following article , we need not be “ overreached by Satan , for we are not ignorant of his designs . ” ​ — 2 Cor .
2 : 11 .
Do I still crave some of the “ freedoms ” of the world ?
How does Satan try to make God’s laws appear burdensome ?
Why must we be extremely careful about our associates ?
For example , God gave Adam and Eve only one restrictive command ​ — the prohibition against eating from “ the tree of the knowledge of good and bad . ”
Why did our original parents lose their God - given freedom ?
Instead , they chose the illegitimate freedom offered by Satan , which was moral independence .
If Satan could induce two perfect humans ​ — not to mention a number of spirit creatures — ​ to reject God’s sovereignty , he could deceive us too .
Sadly , on occasion negative peer influence can also come from within the Christian congregation .
“ Eventually , though , it struck me that the more I hung around with them , the more I was becoming like them .
Absalom was an exceptionally good - looking man .
Did Absalom’s clever scheme succeed ?
And tragically , it also led to his death and the death of the thousands who were overreached by him . ​ — 2 Sam .
( See picture on page 14 . )
“ Deep feelings of guilt and remorse surfaced for many years , ” he said .
( b ) Why is it important to know God well ?
So ask yourself : ‘ Do I recognize Satan’s schemes for what they really are ​ — cruel deceptions ?
Am I fully convinced that he would never withhold from me something that is truly good and will result in my greatest happiness ? ’
When he was still a young man , Solomon humbly said in prayer : “ I am but a little boy .
( b ) How would you apply these Scriptural principles ?
Each one contains an important principle regarding our choice of associates : “ I have not sat with men of untruth ; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in . ”
In effect , Jehovah is saying to us : ‘ Here are the facts .
How will you respond ?
What is in your heart ? ’
Finally , because the three verses are set out as basic truths , they are timeless and have a very broad application .
To illustrate , ask yourself such questions as : How can I avoid associating with individuals “ who hide what they are ” ?
What “ useful habits ” will I ruin by choosing bad associates ?
How can you discern if you are developing a wise and obedient heart ?
Likewise , the writer of Psalm 119 said : “ How I do love your law !
FIGHT FOR YOUR CHRISTIAN FREEDOM !
What must we realize if we are going to win our fight for true freedom ?
Realize that your enemies are not just Satan , the world , and its poisonous spirit .
At times , of course , we all make mistakes .
Hence , we can be sure that Jehovah will answer Jesus ’ prayer by watching over us during these critical times .
Therefore , Absalom should have known that Jehovah had not chosen him as David’s successor . ​ — 2 Sam .

“ Of Whom Shall I Be in Dread ? ”
Psalm 27 : 4
What will the 27th Psalm help us to understand ?
Why do we give freely of our time and energy while many are experiencing economic reversals ?
Jehovah is the stronghold of my life . Of whom shall I be in dread ? ”
While fear can exert a weakening influence , the feeling of dread is even more severe .
When we make Jehovah our stronghold , we “ will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity . ”
In a similar way , Jehovah reveals to us the basic meaning of world events .
When we do , we can act with more wisdom than either our enemies or our teachers . ​ — Ps .
( b ) When especially will Jehovah become our salvation ?
How ?
REMEMBER EACH SUCCESS
An important factor in developing courage is brought to our attention at Psalm 27 : 2 , 3 .
Those memories filled him with confidence to face even the worst of adversities .
Do you draw similar conclusions from your experiences ?
For instance , have you prayed intensely about a distressing problem and then seen how Jehovah gave you wisdom or strength to cope with that trial ?
Or can you recall how obstacles to your joyful service were removed or how a large door of activity was opened to you ?

What effect does remembering such events have on you now ?
APPRECIATE PURE WORSHIP
In David’s day , “ the house of Jehovah ” was the tabernacle .
It was David himself who made arrangements for the elaborate temple structure that was to be built by his son Solomon .
This great spiritual temple is the arrangement Jehovah has made so that we , through our faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice , can approach God acceptably .
9 , 10 .
He understands the circumstances and needs of all his loyal servants .
Or imagine how Thomas , an unbaptized publisher in Sierra Leone , must have felt .
He started working as a teacher in a secondary school , but he could not receive his salary for nearly one year until the paperwork was final .
Quitting that job and forfeiting nearly a year’s salary , Thomas found other work , repairing radios and mobile phones .
Why is this ?
One branch office writes : “ Many householders accepting Bible studies are unemployed and therefore have more time to study during the day .
They will be supplied with everything they need to endure trials and to safeguard their relationship with Jehovah .
“ INSTRUCT ME , O JEHOVAH , IN YOUR WAY ”
Acting in harmony with this prayer means paying careful attention to any Bible - based direction that we receive through Jehovah’s organization and applying it at once .
Had this happened to you , would you have regretted pursuing full - time service to the exclusion of seeking higher education ?
He readily explained that he and his wife were full - time ministers of Jehovah’s Witnesses and wanted to continue as such .
FAITH AND HOPE ESSENTIAL
David next underscores the necessity of faith and hope by saying : “ If I had not had faith in seeing the goodness of Jehovah in the land of those alive — ! ”
[ Picture on page 23 ]
1 , 2 .

Likely it does if you are part of a caring family .
A number of these arrangements are brought to our attention in the Bible book of Ephesians , which has unity as its theme .
This stage began at Pentecost 33 C.E . when Jehovah started to gather those who would rule with Christ in heaven .
During the Thousand Year Reign , they will be joined by billions of resurrected ones .
Those proving faithful will be adopted as earthly “ children of God . ” ​ — Rom .
But as individuals , how do we cooperate now with God’s administration ?
One who has attempted to glue two things together knows that both surfaces must be clean before a proper bond can be forged .
Engaging in brazen conduct demonstrates total disregard for God’s righteous laws .
Each of the other works of the flesh separates people from one another and from God .
How do I respond when problems arise ?
Would such actions show that we are acting in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose to gather all things together again in the Christ ?
10 , 11 . ( a ) How important is it to be at peace with our brothers ?
( b ) What actions will engender peace and spiritual prosperity ?
Be about settling matters quickly . ”
Thus , we cannot maintain righteous conduct in the absence of peace .
In a similar way , our growth in spiritual matters is hindered if we have personal traits that could disrupt peace with our brothers .
Elders , do you try to readjust others with that objective in view ? ​ — Gal .
Application of what Paul wrote next is also essential for peace and unity : “ Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness .
But become kind to one another , tenderly compassionate , freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you . ” ​ — Eph .
4 : 31 , 32 .
When Paul wrote : “ In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies , ” about which “ way ” was he speaking ?
No doubt Satan’s purposes are served as the divorce rate soars , marriage is dispensed with in favor of living together , and marriages between homosexuals are tolerated .
With hearts full of love for our “ one Lord , ” for our “ one God , ” and for one another , we are determined “ to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace . ”
5 : 1 , 2 .
In recent years , she has often reflected on that most joyful time of her life , and she again wanted to increase her share in the ministry .
Once , in front of her fellow workers , she groaned : “ I wish I could work fewer hours ! ”
The director listened carefully and said that he once considered undertaking charity work .
Then he said : “ For the reasons you presented , I feel I must agree with your request .
Emilia is now allowed to work only four days a week .
Have you thought of adjusting your circumstances to enter or reenter the pioneer service ?
FOR me , it all began years ago in Australia where I grew up and where Jehovah began teaching me to do his will .
My dad accepted the book Enemies from a Witness in 1938 .
About a year later , my parents were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah .
My sister , Lesley , who was five years older than I , was baptized next , and I was baptized in 1940 when I was nine years old .
Before the movie began , everyone was supposed to stand up and sing the country’s national anthem .
I argued that I wanted to save it for pioneering , but they were taking it .
They were teaching me to care for myself and not to expect others to do this .
We had fine conversations and started many Bible studies .
Once again we were without accommodations !
It was getting dark , but we decided to visit a few more homes to finish a street .
After about eight months in this preaching assignment , I received an invitation from the Australia branch office to become a circuit overseer .
Those older than I , who included just about everyone , did not look down on my youth but respected the work I was doing .
What variety there was traveling between congregations !
That week my bed was made up in the bathtub , but what a spiritually joyful week we had together !
How would my parents feel , I wondered , about my going off somewhere else in the world so soon thereafter ?
They smiled and said : “ You have experienced your first revolution .
On one occasion , I accompanied the circuit overseer to visit an isolated congregation and to show the film The New World Society in Action .
After finally arriving at our destination , we spent the next day visiting farms and inviting all to the showing of the film that night .
After showing about 20 minutes of the film , we were told to go inside the house as quickly as possible .
We grabbed the projector and obeyed .
The brothers contacted the sheriff , and he came in the afternoon with two horses to take us to town .
A horse , I could see , was an important means of transportation , so I later obtained one .
We bought perishable food each day .
Then , when we were to build a new branch office , I was appointed as chairman of the building committee .
I also received the privilege of visiting other branches throughout the world as a zone overseer to provide help and encouragement .
OUR PRESENT ASSIGNMENT
After more than 11 years , we are still in Brooklyn .
Elsie and I now are in our early 80 ’ s and still have reasonably good health .

For how long did the rulership that David and Jerusalem represented lie dormant ?
In Bible prophecy , days often represent years .
When did Jesus become King ?
Jesus ’ first act as King was to expel Satan and his demons from heaven .

A Conversation With a Neighbor ​ — Do All Good People Go to Heaven ?
Do you have a particular Bible question that you have wondered about ?
Are you curious about any of the beliefs or religious practices of Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
Have you given much thought to what those who go to heaven will do there ?
Would you please read this verse ?
It says : “ The righteous themselves will possess the earth , and they will reside forever upon it . ”
Robert : The verse says they’ll reside on the earth .
Robert : Maybe that just means that there will always be good people on earth .
Robert : I’m not sure I follow you .
A Future Earthly Paradise
Robert : Yes .
Marcus : Exactly .
It’s only here on earth that people die .
Those who live on the earth will enjoy the benefits foretold here in Revelation .
“ The Wicked One Will Be No More ”
Marcus : Earlier we read verse 29 of Psalm 37 .
Let’s go back to that psalm .
But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth , and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace . ”
Marcus : Thank you .
Now , if those bad tenants refused to clean up their act , what would you do ?
Robert : I’d evict them .
Did they all go to heaven ?
First , let me jot down a few scriptures that have a bearing on the topic .
See Job 14 : 13 - 15 ; John 3 : 13 ; and Acts 2 : 34 .

I’ll write him a letter to make him feel better , and then I’ll deliver it too ! ”
What was happening ?
How can there be justice when leaders who should preserve and promote lawfulness abuse their power and snuff out innocent lives ?
True to his word , he allowed the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem and take her people captive in 607 B.C.E .
Why not learn more about the God who “ is a lover of justice ” and how you can draw closer to him ? ​ — Psalm 37 : 28 . Suggested Bible reading for August :

Beware of the Devil’s Snares !
Stand Firm and Avoid Satan’s Traps !
POPULATION
1,515,000
“ I Am With You ”
IMAGINE yourself in Paradise .
Each morning , you awake feeling rested and eager to begin your day .
You have no aches or pains .
Viewed metaphorically and in harmony with the facts of our day , the Hebrew verb here translated “ rove about ” conveys the idea of a careful examination .
What became of “ the true knowledge ” following the death of the apostles ?
Though claiming to believe in the Scriptures , the leaders of Christendom taught religious lies ​ — “ teachings of demons ” that dishonored God .
Though the Bible Students were excited about the things they were learning , they did not allow their newfound knowledge to puff them up with pride ; nor did they take credit for proclaiming something new .
They help us to come to know Jehovah ​ — his loving personality and his purposes .
3 : 1 - 5 ; Luke 21 : 10 , 11 .
To whom do we give credit for the things we have come to see and hear ?
For I say to you , Many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are beholding but did not see them , and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them . ”
The article read : “ To those so situated that they can give one - half or more of their time exclusively to the work of the Lord , we have a plan to suggest . . . , viz : That you go forth into large or small cities , according to your ability , as Colporteurs or Evangelists , seek to find in every place the earnest Christians , many of whom you will find possessed of a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge ; to these seek to make known the riches of Our Father’s grace , and the beauties of His word . ”
How did people respond to the call for full - time preachers ?
But the call for 1,000 full - time preachers was optimistic , since only a few hundred attended the meetings of the Bible Students at that time .
After reading a tract or a magazine , however , many people recognized the ring of truth and readily responded to the call .
Today , we typically study the Bible with one person at a time , providing individual instruction .
What impresses you about the scope of “ the true knowledge ” today ?
He added that his followers would be persecuted , imprisoned , and even killed .
“ THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE ” BECOMES “ ABUNDANT ”
It has also become abundant through the printed word .
How is our printing operation financed ?
( Read Matthew 10 : 8 . )
God’s will is that “ all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Out of “ all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues , ” he is also gathering “ a great crowd , ” who have the hope of living forever on earth . ​ — Rev .
See Isaiah’s Prophecy ​ — Light for All Mankind II , page 320 .
Jehovah values your efforts in spreading “ the true knowledge ” of God
“ Carry on as citizens . ” ​ — PHIL . 1 : 27 , ftn .
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
( a ) Who have the opportunity to be Kingdom citizens ?
To deepen our appreciation for that privilege , let us consider some similarities between the requirements for becoming a citizen of a human government and a citizen of God’s Kingdom .
Citizens of God’s Kingdom may learn basic Bible teachings quickly and get baptized .
Even after their baptism , however , they must strive to “ speak ” the pure language better and better .
Each of us needs to close the gap between what we know about Bible principles and what we practice .
They took great delight in Jerusalem and its place of worship and in recounting the city’s history .
Jerusalem was “ the town of the grand King , ” Jehovah , for it was the center of pure worship .
Your desire to preach the good news of the Kingdom will naturally intensify . ​ — Jer .
Know the laws .
To remain Kingdom citizens , we need not only to know God’s standards but also to love them .
We gladly obey God’s laws , even when no other human is looking .
Would you become defensive , resentful , or stubborn ?
Consider two more topics of vital concern : our attitude toward sex and our view of marriage .
Those who are not yet citizens of God’s Kingdom may condone homosexuality , consider pornography to be harmless fun , and think that adultery and divorce are purely personal matters .
What timely warnings does God’s Kingdom issue , and how do you feel about such warnings ?
For instance , the Internet has become a useful way to provide communication , education , and entertainment .
Have you read all the recent material published by the faithful slave about the use of social networking sites ?
How unwise it would be to use such sites without reading that material !
Those who ignore warnings issued by the faithful slave inevitably cause harm to themselves and to their loved ones .


*
Soon God’s Kingdom will be the only government ruling the earth .
Will you be a good citizen of God’s Kingdom at that time ?
See The Watchtower , August 15 , 2011 , pages 6 - 7 and Our Kingdom Ministry , January 2011 , pages 3 - 6 .
Beware of the Devil’s Snares !
2 : 26 .
From the examples of Pilate and Peter , what can you learn about not giving in to fear and pressure ?
THE Devil stalks Jehovah’s servants .
Rather , the Devil’s main goal is to capture his quarry alive and use the person as he sees fit . ​ — Read 2 Timothy 2 : 24 - 26 .
He may try to get the animal to come out into the open where he can capture it with a noose .
Or he may use a hidden trap that has a trigger and takes the animal by surprise .
If we want to avoid being caught , we must be alert and heed warning signs indicating that one of Satan’s snares , or traps , is nearby .
In a figurative sense , the Devil would like to set the Christian congregation ablaze .
( Read James 3 : 6 - 8 . )
Rather than being suspicious of our brother , we would do well to consider why we are critical of him .
It could be that we feel justified in speaking critically of someone .
( Read Proverbs 29 : 25 . )
“ If you release this man , you are not a friend of Caesar , ” cried those opposers , thus applying pressure in order to get their way .
Pilate may have feared that he would lose his position ​ — or possibly his life — ​ if he sided with Christ .
Later , however , Peter succumbed to fear and denied even knowing Jesus Christ .
Peter had both accurate knowledge and love for God .
Prior to Jesus ’ arrest , Peter boasted : “ Even if all the others are stumbled , yet I will not be . ”
But Peter fell asleep again and later gave in to fear and pressure .
Be determined not to repeat the steps that led to the sin , and act on that resolve .
Jehovah forgave the man who was expelled from the congregation in Corinth for flagrant immorality but who later repented .
Jehovah will forgive and forget your past errors if you are truly repentant and accept his mercy .

In the following article , we will learn how to avoid two more traps that the Devil has found to be effective in catching God’s servants alive .
Parents would do well to discuss with their children the “ Peer - Pressure Planner ” that appears in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 2 , pages 132 - 133 .
“ Stand firm against the machinations of the Devil . ” ​ — EPH .
How can a servant of Jehovah avoid being caught in the trap of materialism ?
Why do you believe that it is beneficial to take a firm stand against materialism and sexual immorality ?
In fact , Satan is waging war on the anointed remnant .
Those stalwart Christians have spearheaded the modern - day Kingdom - preaching work and have exposed Satan as the ruler of this world .
3 , 4 .
How might the anxieties of this system of things lead to materialism ?
He pointed out that a person may hear the word , “ but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful . ”
Some have even become slaves to riches . ​ — Matt .
( b ) What concerns should a Christian consider when the possibility of overtime work is presented to him ?
For example , consider this scenario .
Your employer approaches you and says : “ I have good news !
The company has won a huge contract .
Will your secular work interfere with your spiritual activities , including congregation meetings and your Family Worship evening ?

Be careful not to lose out on the privilege of being a disciple of Jesus Christ .
or , ‘ What are we to drink ? ’
Rather than fall victim to the deceptive power of riches , strive to adopt the viewpoint of the Bible writer Agur , who stated : “ Don’t let me be too poor or too rich .
Therefore , make it your resolve not to be caught in Satan’s trap of materialism ! ​ — Read Hebrews 13 : 5 .
A number of Christians have fallen into that pit by letting themselves get into situations in which compromise is all too easy .
In fact , a secular study revealed that more than half of adulterous women and nearly 3 out of 4 adulterous men had illicit relations with a workmate .
For example , after repeated casual conversations with a male coworker , a Christian sister might make him her confidant , even telling him about her marital problems .
How could an improper romantic relationship develop within the congregation ?
He eagerly accepted every privilege that came his way .
“ This , coupled with the fact that I had been neglecting her , led to a disastrous turn of events .
To avoid the pit of adultery , reflect on the meaning of marital commitment .
The article entitled “ Marital Fidelity ​ — What Does It Really Mean ? ”

A GOOD REPORT FROM MEXICO
Baltasar Perla interviewed three fellow members of the Mexico Bethel family regarding the merger of six Central American branch offices with the Mexico branch .
Over 400 elders have served where shepherding was needed .
The Governing Body’s concern was evident when two zone overseers from world headquarters traveled to the disaster area to offer encouragement .
“ Then our property in Brooklyn can be sold . ”

Brother Herd referred to Psalm 92 : 12 - 14 and asked , “ How does Jehovah enable us to flourish ? ”
Some of these were Archbishop Agobard of Lyons in the 9th century , Peter of Bruys , Henry of Lausanne , and Valdès ( or , Waldo ) in the 12th century , John Wycliffe in the 14th century , William Tyndale in the 16th century , and Henry Grew and George Storrs in the 19th century .
Jehovah’s Witnesses today continue to uphold Scriptural standards and recognize the Bible as the foundation of truth .
An announcement made by Anthony Morris of the Governing Body outlined adjustments for missionaries and special pioneers .
As of September 2012 , classes of the Bible School for Christian Couples will be held in selected countries .
Graduates will be used to strengthen and stabilize God’s people either from branch offices , in the traveling work , or in densely populated areas where they can encourage congregations in the preaching work .

As of January 1 , 2012 , some graduates of the Bible School for Single Brothers and the Bible School for Christian Couples were to be assigned as temporary special pioneers and used to open up and expand the work in remote areas .
Those proving effective may receive permanent assignments .

COSTA RICA

How many new Bible students have felt that way about the prospect of preaching to strangers !
This objection , though , came from an experienced public speaker and Bible teacher called a pilgrim .
After his evening discourse in a school , Hugo Riemer , who later became a member of the Governing Body , answered Bible questions until past midnight .
Weary but happy , he declared that the meeting was “ beautiful . ”
But she admits , “ By then everybody was about half asleep . ”
The pilgrims excelled at teaching and using charts , models , or whatever they had at hand to make their subject come alive . R .
Fatherly W . J .
They would now be expected to take the lead in preaching from house to house .
Pilgrims are sent out for this purpose . ”
Robie D .
Adkins recounted that one pilgrim who was an excellent speaker lamented bitterly : “ All I know is how to preach from the platform .
He was the most miserable looking person there , standing alone in the shade of a small tree , forlorn among thousands of joyful brothers .
On the other hand , “ many happy brothers were passing by carrying books to their cars , ” obviously eager to witness from house to house . ​ — Acts 20 : 20 , 21 .
Bohnet reported that the brothers in general heartily approved the emphasis on Kingdom preaching .
To this very day , such self - sacrificing and loyal traveling overseers are helping fellow believers to say , “ We can go from door to door ! ”
Where the valley widens , Asa pauses and gasps .
Asa’s army totals a little over half that many men .
In the face of an impending battle , what occupies Asa more than anything else ?
Orders for his generals ?

Before we review that prayer and examine what happened on this occasion , consider the kind of man Asa was .
When Asa became king in 977 B.C.E . , even the royal court was tainted by the worship of Canaanite fertility gods .
Asa “ removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles . ”
14 : 4 .
Pleased with Asa’s zeal for true worship , Jehovah rewarded him with years of peace . The king could thus say : “ We have searched for Jehovah our God .
Asa recognized that if he relied on God and had his backing , it did not matter how numerous or powerful the enemy was .
15 : 1 , 2 , 7 .
“ Be courageous , ” said Azariah .
However , there was also an ominous side to the words of the prophet Azariah .
“ YOU HAVE ACTED FOOLISHLY ”
When the Syrians carried out some attacks , Baasha withdrew from Ramah . ​ — 2 Chron .
16 : 7 - 9 .
Asa reacted badly . In a rage , he threw the prophet Hanani into the stocks .
The Bible does not say .
At that time , Asa seems to have been neglecting his spiritual health .
Evidently in that condition and frame of mind , he died in the 41st year of his rule . ​ — 2 Chron .
Nevertheless , Asa’s good qualities and zeal for pure worship seem to have outweighed his errors .
He rewards them by exerting his power in their behalf .
Did Samson’s hair give him strength ?
Samson’s hair in itself did not give him strength .
What are some factors showing that the Bible is not just another book written by men ?
When did the Anglo - American World Power become the seventh world power of Bible prophecy ?
A great variety of miracles were performed , and opposers of the time did not question that they occurred .
FROM OUR COVER
4 Does God Really Care About Women ?
“ When I see how women are treated , I really don’t want to become one . ” ​ — ZAHRA , 15 YEARS OLD , quoted in the magazine GEO , French edition .
THE words of the young girl , shown above , reveal a grim reality ​ — worldwide , violence and discrimination affect girls and women throughout their lives .
Worldwide , women and girls make up two thirds of those who had less than four years of schooling .
In developing countries , about every two minutes , a woman dies from pregnancy or childbirth complications as a result of the lack of basic medical care .
Why have women been deprived of such basic rights ?
Do you think that the Bible belittles women , as many other religious books do ?
THOSE ancient verses are not from the Bible .
For centuries , they have been used to justify discrimination against women .
Instead , it is “ the original serpent , the one called Devil , ” who has been “ cursed ” by God .
He was simply foretelling the sad consequences of sin on the first couple .
Genesis 1 : 27 states : “ God proceeded to create the man in his image , in God’s image he created him ; male and female he created them . ”
So from the very beginning , humans ​ — both male and female — ​ were created with the ability to reflect God’s qualities .
Although Adam and Eve had their own unique emotional and physical makeup , they both received the same commission and enjoyed the same rights before their Maker . ​ — Genesis 1 : 28 - 31 .
For example , some women likely did “ organized service ” at the tabernacle , while others performed in a mixed choir of singers . ​ — Exodus 38 : 8 ; 1 Chronicles 25 : 5 , 6 .
Many women had the knowledge and skill needed to run a profitable business .
The Ten Commandments clearly stipulated : “ Honor your father and your mother . ”
The Law included detailed regulations regarding conduct among unmarried persons , showing respect for females .
A good husband had to take into account his wife’s physical and biological limitations . ​ — Leviticus 18 : 19 .
In his Word , Jehovah portrays himself as “ a father of fatherless boys and a judge of widows . ”
He told Moses : “ Give them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of their father’s brothers , and you must cause their father’s inheritance to pass to them . ”
However , from the fourth century B.C.E . on , Judaism started to be influenced by Greek culture , which regarded women as inferior . ​ — See the box “ Discrimination Against Women in Ancient Writings . ”
In Jesus ’ day , their access to the temple precincts had already been limited to the Court of Women .
Has true Christianity brought relief to women ?




I always do the things pleasing to him . ”
How is that so ?
Their rabbis taught that a husband could never commit adultery against his wife ​ — only a woman could be unfaithful !
However , they need not fear indecent looks or undue familiarity , because Christian men are careful to treat “ older women as mothers , younger women as sisters with all chasteness . ” ​ — 1 Timothy 5 : 2 .
Jesus took time to teach women .
Mary’s sister , Martha , also benefited from his teaching , as shown by her intelligent answers to Jesus after Lazarus ’ death . ​ — John 11 : 21 - 27 .
At that time , most Jewish women believed that the key to happiness was to have a worthy son , if possible one who was a prophet .
Jesus seized the opportunity to tell her about something better .
They respect mature women for being “ teachers of what is good , ” both in private and by example .
Christian parents make sure that all their children receive proper education and health care .
Jesus trusted women .
The effect of his teaching today : In congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses , men who have responsibilities show consideration for women by taking into account their observations .
I also understood that if my husband studied the Bible , it could change his attitude toward me . ”
“ We learned to forgive each other freely . ”
Yelena’s experience is not unique .
Millions of Christian women are happy because they and their husbands together endeavor to apply Bible principles in their marriage .

In his letter to the Corinthians , Paul advised not only women but also individuals who had the gift of tongues and prophecy to “ keep silent ” when another believer was speaking .
In order to avoid such disorder , Paul encouraged them to “ question their own husbands at home . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 14 : 35 .
As depicted in the picture on the right , many people imagine that on Judgment Day billions of souls will be brought before God’s throne to be judged according to their former deeds ​ — some to be rewarded with life in heaven , others to be tormented in hell .
God has appointed Jesus to be the Judge who will restore justice to mankind . ​ — Read Isaiah 11 : 1 - 5 ; Acts 17 : 31 .

When the first man , Adam , deliberately rebelled against God , he subjected all his offspring to sin , suffering , and death .
To correct that injustice , Jesus will bring back to life , or resurrect , billions from the dead .
The book of Revelation reveals that this will take place during the thousand - year rule of Christ Jesus . ​ — Read Revelation 20 : 4 , 11 , 12 .
Some of the resurrected ones , however , will not want to learn Jehovah’s ways .
This day of judgment will come as suddenly as the Flood of Noah’s day , which swept away an entire wicked generation .
For more information , see pages 213 - 215 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Is Jehovah concerned about clearing his name ?
Consider what is said in the book of Ezekiel . ​ — Read Ezekiel 39 : 7 .
“ I shall no more let my holy name be profaned , ” Jehovah says .
When humans blame him for injustice , they are profaning his name .
What is known of Jehovah when it comes to injustice ?
* When humans claim that God is responsible for the very things he abhors , they are sullying his reputation .
They are thus “ treating [ his ] name with disrespect . ” ​ — Psalm 74 : 10 .
Jehovah’s name is holy because the God who bears it is holy ​ — completely separated from anything that is sinful and unclean .
Our Readers Ask . . .
They are a great host of preachers of the good news of God’s Kingdom .
In what ways are they different ?
The audience of their ministry is different .
Only men who are appointed as teachers do so . ​ — 1 Timothy 3 : 2 ; James 3 : 1 .
The disciple Luke wrote about Jesus ’ ministry : “ He went journeying from city to city and from village to village , preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God . ”

HAVE you ever wanted something very much ? — * If so , you are like most people .
A person who does that is greedy .
Let’s see how a man named Gehazi was ruined by greed .
He tells it because he wants to have the clothes that Naaman tried to give to Elisha .
Naaman , of course , does not know this .
So he is happy to give Gehazi the gifts .

How This World Will Come to an End
Peace for a Thousand Years ​ — And Beyond !
PAGE 8 • SONGS : 55 , 134
Learn From the Patience of Jehovah and Jesus
Momentous events are soon to take place .
All God’s people are eager for this wicked system to end .
This article will show that there are benefits to not knowing the exact day or hour when the end will arrive .
BAPTIZED DURING 2011
What yet unseen developments are indicated in the following scriptures ?
1 Thessalonians 5 : 3
As the context shows , Paul wrote these words to encourage fellow believers to focus on the happy outcome of their faithful course .
Doing so would also help them to cope with trials and persecution . ​ — 2 Cor .
We need to focus on significant events that are as yet unseen .
As used here , “ Jehovah’s day ” refers to the period that will start with the destruction of false religion and will culminate in the war of Armageddon .
Nations may think that they are close to solving some of their big problems .
The clergy would thus be imitating the false prophets of ancient Judah .
when there is no peace . ” ​ — Jer .
Therefore , let us be determined to “ stay awake and keep our senses . ” ​ — 1 Thess .
Thus , in a stunning reversal , one part of Satan’s system will attack another part , and Satan will be powerless to prevent it . ​ — Matt .
Meanwhile , we want to use every opportunity to strengthen our faith so that we will be able to keep our integrity to Jehovah no matter what tests we may face .
What should we do ?
25 : 21 .
10 , 11 .
Jehovah , by means of Jesus and the heavenly armies , will intervene in behalf of His people .
The nations will have to realize that their crushing defeat is brought about by the order of Jehovah himself .
* What , though , does Jehovah have in store for Satan himself ?
Jesus Christ ​ — the “ angel . . . with the key of the abyss ” ​ — will seize Satan and his demons , hurl them into the abyss , and keep them there for a thousand years .
What will it mean for Satan to be in “ the abyss ” ?
What is “ the abyss ” into which Satan and the demons will be hurled ?
There , Satan will be in a state of deathlike inactivity so that “ he might not mislead the nations anymore . ”
5 : 8 .
Then we will witness the destruction of Babylon the Great , the attack by Gog of Magog , the battle of Armageddon , and the hurling into the abyss of Satan and his demons .
After these events , when all wickedness is gone , we will enter a new chapter in life ​ — Christ’s Millennial Reign , during which we will enjoy an “ abundance of peace . ” ​ — Ps .
However , a parallel Bible prophecy shows that “ the kings of the entire inhabited earth ” will be lined up against Jehovah on “ the great day of God the Almighty . ”



John 5 : 28 , 29
Wonderful events await the unnumbered “ great crowd ” ​ — survivors of “ the great tribulation , ” which will bring a total end to the present wicked system of things . ​ — Rev .
4 : 18 .
5 , 6 . ( a ) Isaiah 65 : 21 and Micah 4 : 4 will have what fulfillment ?
( b ) How can we receive that blessing ?
How different everything will be under Kingdom rule !
To his Master Worker , his firstborn Son , Jehovah stated his specific purpose : “ Let us make man in our image , according to our likeness , and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth . ”
What animal behavior is common today ?
That was for the animals ’ self - preservation .
Could not Jehovah remove a measure of that fear and terror , so that his original mandate would be fulfilled ?
What an enjoyable time awaits all who will survive to live on earth then !

Why are tears common in human experience ?
Things are similar , if not worse , today .
Who among us has not shed tears for some reason ?
Recall the many touching and emotional scenes we read about in the Bible .
In fact , “ for fear of death , ” millions are “ subject to slavery all through their lives . ” ​ — Heb .
Think of the expressions “ they were beside themselves with great ecstasy ” and “ they began to glorify God . ”
Jesus said : “ The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”
During the Thousand Year Reign , marvelous things presently “ unseen ” will be brought to reality .
What will happen then ?
He humbly “ hands over the kingdom to his God and Father . ”
They will follow Jesus ’ example and humbly and willingly acknowledge Jehovah’s sovereignty .
What a joyful and jubilant time that will be !
Will you strengthen your resolve to support and uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
May your actions prove that it is your desire to do so forever .
Though we have ample reason for believing that the end of Satan’s system is very near , it can be difficult to wait patiently for that day .
( Read Hebrews 6 : 11 , 12 . )
The answers to these questions can help us to build patience and strong faith , even if it might seem to us that Jehovah is delaying .

Jesus said that our time is similar to the days of Noah .
Jehovah has decided when he will bring this wicked system to an end .
Clearly , Jehovah’s patience does not mean that he is simply waiting for time to pass .
Consider , too , how Jesus exercised godly patience .
Under what circumstances did Jesus show patience ?
Think of what that meant for Jesus ​ — patiently waiting thousands of years till the time had come .
He soon will go into action to bring an end to Satan’s system .
Do you see in Jesus ’ example the way you should view Jehovah’s timetable ?

( b ) Why do we have valid reasons for having strong faith ?
( Read James 5 : 10 , 11 . )
He fulfilled prophecy and revealed God’s purposes in a way that gives us valid reasons for having faith .
This process is similar to the cycle in the natural world of sowing , cultivating , and reaping .
He sent his only - begotten Son “ to break up the works of the Devil ” and undo all the damage Satan has brought upon humans .
1 : 9 .
During these difficult final days of this system of things , we may experience special challenges to our faith .
In other words , he might be thinking , ‘ I will wait and see if Jehovah really is true to his word . ’
Rather , we need to remain alert and work diligently at preaching the good news , which is a source of incomparable satisfaction even now . ​ — Luke 21 : 36 .
( b ) We will receive what blessings from manifesting patience now ?
5 : 10 .
There is no need to fear the future or even death .
So we must make sure that we do not allow the world to seduce us and make us stop relying on Jehovah .
In what ways can we show that we are ready for Christ’s arrival ?
As you do , the official arrives .
In his parables of the virgins and the talents , Jesus used similar situations to illustrate why during the time of the end , some anointed Christians would prove to be faithful and discreet , but others would not .
We can apply that counsel today .
Who have proved themselves ready for survival ?
And what must we do now to stay on the watch ?

Why does ‘ staying awake ’ not mean watching the clock ?
Under such circumstances , it is far more important to focus on the work at hand than to keep to a schedule .
How may not knowing the day or the hour help reveal what is in our heart ?
We , on the other hand , are not fearful .
We refuse to isolate ourselves so as to cater to our own selfish longings .
We find pleasure in serving God , especially in helping others come to know him .
“ These things , ” says Paul , “ were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
The last days of this system are indeed “ critical times hard to deal with . ”
1 : 2 - 4 ; 4 : 8 .
After 1914 , why did some of the anointed conclude that the Lord was delaying ?
One brother later recalled , “ A few of us seriously thought we were going to heaven during the first week of that October [ 1914 ] . ”
How will sticking close to God’s channel for dispensing spiritual food safeguard us ?
( Read Psalm 119 : 130 ; John 16 : 13 . )
Among the survivors was an anointed brother named Ernst Wauer , who later recalled : “ Jehovah helped us in a marvelous way to commit to memory the fortifying thoughts in the articles . ”
They started seven Bible studies . Many more exciting experiences followed .
There are , of course , many other brothers and sisters who have reflected in their decisions their determination to be fully occupied in God’s service whenever the end comes .
Keeping our hand to the plow , so to speak , and avoiding distractions has led to abundant joy in our Master’s service . ​ — Luke 9 : 62 .
We are fast approaching God’s day of judgment .
They have entrusted us with precious privileges of service in these last days .
We can and will continue to prove ourselves ready .
10 : 11 .

INTERNATIONAL and district conventions have been a feature of the modern - day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses for as long as most of us can remember .
Thousands of years ago , God’s people also held holy conventions .

29 : 1 - 15 ; 30 : 15 - 20 ; 31 : 30 .
So at this early stage in the history of God’s people , it was clear that they were to gather frequently to consider Jehovah’s word and purposes .
Rutherford , who urged his attentive audience : “ Be faithful and true witnesses for the Lord .
Go forward in the fight until every vestige of Babylon lies desolate .
Therefore advertise , advertise , advertise , the King and his kingdom . ”
8 , 9 .
Especially notable at the 1946 “ Glad Nations ” Theocratic Assembly in Cleveland , Ohio , was Brother Knorr’s discourse “ The Problems of Reconstruction and Expansion . ”
While one could see no distinct face from the platform , it was easy to sense their joy . ”
At an international convention in New York City in 1950 , the audience was delighted to receive the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures , the first installment of a modern - language Bible that restored God’s name to its rightful place in his Word . ​ — Jer .
Adolf Hitler had vowed to destroy Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany , but 107,000 of them filled his former parade grounds in Nuremberg during a convention in 1955 .

Perhaps there are district conventions or international conventions that stand out in your mind .
How long do you think it would take you to complete such a trip , walking with small children ?
Yet , conditions were safe enough for a 12 - year - old like Jesus to be allowed a certain amount of freedom .

An answer can be found in Jehovah’s directions to his people regarding the Festival of Booths : “ You must rejoice during your festival , you and your son and your daughter and your man slave and your slave girl and the Levite and the alien resident and the fatherless boy and the widow , who are inside your gates .
15 , 16 .
These events were ​ — and still are — ​ important spiritual occasions .
They provide us with information and understanding that are critical to our maintaining a close relationship with God .
122 : 1 - 4 .
The report added : “ The Volunteer Service Department registered workers from among the delegates to man all [ the ] departments , purely out of the joy of serving their fellow witnesses . ”
Certain things have changed in the way conventions are organized .
What aspects of conventions do you look forward to , and why ?
Such releases are often tools that help sincere individuals appreciate Scriptural truths .
Stimulating Bible - based dramas encourage both young and old to examine their motives and guard against the pressures exerted by the world’s ungodly thinking .

Yes , long a part of pure worship , conventions equip Jehovah’s joyful people to serve him appropriately in challenging times .

Love motivates him to educate and train others .
In imitation of Jehovah’s pattern of love , the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body uses ten theocratic schools to train ones who have both the desire and the circumstances to enroll .
As “ the God of love , ” Jehovah provides training that adds meaning to our lives , prepares us to overcome challenges , and helps us to experience great joy in our ministry .
Like first - century disciples , we are well - equipped to help others , “ teaching them to observe all the things ” we have been commanded . ​ — Matt .
We can also increase our effectiveness in the ministry by working alongside well - trained servants of Jehovah .
Jehovah’s worshippers consider it a privilege to support these valuable schools and to be taught there .
Location : Local Kingdom Hall .
Location : Bethel .
Qualifications : Must be a permanent member of the Bethel family or a temporary volunteer who has been approved to serve at Bethel for a year or longer .

Qualifications : Must have been a regular pioneer for a year or longer .
Qualifications : Must be an appointed elder .
Purpose : To help circuit and district overseers to be more effective in serving congregations as they “ work hard in speaking and teaching . ” ​ — 1 Tim .

STUDY ARTICLES
This article will help us to learn from ancient and modern examples of those who have faced dire circumstances .
The second article highlights examples of humans who have let their Yes mean Yes and encourages baptized Christians to be true to their most important Yes . ​ — Matt .

3 They Offered Themselves Willingly ​ — In Brazil
LOCATIONS IN MANHATTAN
SOME years ago , Rúbia , a sister now 30 years old , made a trip to visit Sandra , a pioneer who served in a small congregation in southern Brazil .
People who wanted to get to know Jehovah had to be put on a waiting list !
Some years ago , Bruno , now 28 years of age , studied at a famous music school , and his goal was to become an orchestra conductor .
He was headed for a promising career .
“ Still , ” relates Bruno , “ I felt that something was missing in my life .
“ I conducted as many as 18 Bible studies , ” he relates .
“ Seeing how these students made changes in their life gave me so much joy ! ”
I would never have enjoyed this had I pursued materialistic goals . ”
Mariana , now in her late 20 ’ s , found herself in a situation similar to Bruno’s .
I simply had to stay . ”

“ Why move ? There’s still a lot to do in our own congregation . ”
And when it comes to the things that really matter , we have much more than we had before . ”
The blessings more than compensate for the challenges !
So I began to make an effort to get better acquainted with the brothers and sisters in the congregation ​ — and it worked !
I made new friends , and before long I felt very happy and much at home . ”


“ Since [ God ] could not swear by anyone greater , he swore by himself . ” ​ — HEB .

How do we benefit from God’s sworn promise to Abraham ?

It was some time after the creation of Adam’s wife , Eve , about 6,000 years ago .
Ahead of us lies the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ , which will ensure the fulfillment of God’s purpose in creating the earth to be an everlasting paradise filled with perfect mankind .
Can you be sure that you will have such a happy future ?
Indeed you can !
After God’s rest day began , however , disaster struck .

Making oaths was a legal tool that the patriarch Abraham used to good advantage on at least three occasions .
The kings of Salem and Sodom came out to meet Abraham .
Then , when the king of Sodom wanted to reward Abraham for rescuing the king’s people from the invading armies , Abraham swore : “ I do lift up my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God , Producer of heaven and earth , that , from a thread to a sandal lace , no , I shall take nothing from anything that is yours , in order that you may not say , ‘ It was I who made Abram rich . ’ ” ​ — Gen .
22 : 1 - 3 , 9 - 12 , 15 - 18 .
7 , 8 . ( a ) For what purpose did God swear to Abraham ?
( b ) How will Jesus ’ “ other sheep ” benefit from God’s sworn promise ?
Referring to that occasion , God said : “ In the day of my choosing Israel , . . .
Then , after Israel’s deliverance from Egypt , Jehovah made another sworn promise to them : “ If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant , then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples , because the whole earth belongs to me .
And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation . ”
Later , in describing what he had done for Israel on that occasion , Jehovah stated : “ I proceeded . . . to make a sworn statement to you and enter into a covenant with you . ” ​ — Ezek .
At that time , Jehovah did not oblige Israel to make a sworn oath that they would be obedient ; nor did God force the Israelites into this privileged relationship .
What was Israel’s response ?
What were the responses of Jehovah and of his chosen people to the covenant that had been established between them ?
Jehovah immediately began to fulfill his side of the Law covenant by arranging for a tent of worship and a priesthood that made it possible for sinful humans to approach him .
Israel , on the other hand , quickly forgot their dedication to God and “ pained even the Holy One of Israel . ”
So they made a golden image of a calf and said to the people : “ This is your God , O Israel , who led you up out of the land of Egypt . ”
Sadly , from then on Israel had a history of making vows to God that they later broke . ​ — Num .

First , he swore to David that his throne would last forever .
Second , Jehovah inspired David to foretell that this unique King would also serve as mankind’s High Priest .
Also , he serves as mankind’s High Priest by helping repentant ones to come into an acceptable relationship with God . ​ — Read Hebrews 7 : 21 , 25 , 26 .
( b ) What command did Jesus give his followers about the making of vows ?
That new nation was born at Pentecost 33 C.E . when God’s spirit was poured out on about 120 disciples of Jesus gathered in Jerusalem .
These became known as “ the Israel of God ” and soon numbered into several thousand made up of people from every nation of the then - known world . ​ — Gal .
One of the commands that its members obey concerns the making of sworn oaths .
Jesus taught his followers : “ Do not swear at all . . . Just let your word Yes mean Yes , your No , No ; for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one . ” ​ — Matt .
As we continue to meditate on God’s Word , may we be motivated to keep on obeying Jehovah .
How could that be ?
Also , God’s Law required the taking of a sworn oath to settle certain disputes .
Even so , to emphasize the reliability of his message , he often introduced what he said in this unique way : “ Most truly [ literally , “ Truly , truly , ” ftn . ]
I say to you . ”
With these meaningful words , Jesus presented himself to God to carry out all that was foretold about the promised Seed , including his being ‘ bruised in the heel ’ by Satan .
From heaven , Jehovah voiced his complete trust in his Son , though not requiring that Jesus swear to be true to his word . ​ — Luke 3 : 21 , 22 .
“ What shall I do , Lord ? ”
With these sincere words , Paul , then known as Saul , responded to the direction of the glorified Lord Jesus , who had appeared to him in a vision to stop him from persecuting Christ’s disciples .
6 , 7 . ( a ) Why did Paul change his plan to revisit Corinth , and why were his critics not justified in questioning his trustworthiness ?
To correct the situation , he wrote strong counsel in his first letter to the Corinthians .
Then , instead of sailing directly from Ephesus to Corinth , Paul decided to give his brothers time to apply his counsel so that when he eventually arrived , his visit could be more encouraging .
11 : 1 ; Heb .
What example did Rebekah set for us ?
“ I am willing to go . ”
But Ruth’s No meant No .
( Read Ruth 1 : 16 , 17 . )
Isaiah proved true to his word ​ — his Yes meant Yes .
For over 46 years , he faithfully served as a prophet , delivering strong messages of denunciation as well as wonderful promises about the restoration of true worship .
( a ) Why is being true to our word so important ?
And how serious is the matter of letting our Yes mean Yes ?
The Bible clearly warns that a person who is “ false to agreements ” is among those who are “ deserving of death . ”
When two elders interview a person who would like to become an unbaptized publisher , the person is asked , “ Do you really want to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses ? ”
Proving true to our dedication vow means that we must also be faithful in other important matters .

There is also a loving provision for Christians who commit such a sin .
If we confess the specific sin to Jehovah , he will mercifully forgive us through the office of our High Priest , Jesus Christ .
For the 144,000 anointed ones , it will mean immortal life in heaven , where they will share with Jesus in his Kingdom “ and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years . ”


How can we avoid being overwhelmed by distressing events ?
What reasons do we have for displaying courage ?
What adversities have many experienced , but what is the desire of God’s servants ?
What will help us meet today’s adversities with courage ?
Consider David .
Yet , they resolutely coped with things like a famine and dangers from surrounding nations .
He maintained his integrity and his faith in God .
What did Paul experience as he served God , but what realization gave him the courage to continue ?
Despite all of that , note the attitude he expressed after he had faced death for serving God : “ This was that we might have our trust , not in ourselves , but in the God who raises up the dead .
Not many people have had as many bad experiences as Paul did .
( b ) How can we cope with the reality mentioned at Acts 14 : 22 ?
However , we must not allow him to sap our joy in this way .
Your power will be scanty . ”
How can we avoid being overwhelmed by life’s adversities ?
Instead of dwelling on negative events , do what is practical to cope with each problem and focus on the positive aspects of your life . ​ — Prov .
In recent times , some countries have suffered severe disasters .
Notably , many brothers in these lands have shown remarkable resilience . This does not mean that it was easy .

In September 2009 , over 80 percent of Manila , Philippines , was flooded by torrential rains .
Building one’s life around material things , which can so quickly disappear , often brings disappointment .
( a ) What provision may help us maintain a courageous outlook ?
She wrote , “ It helped me to understand my own problem and gave me hope . ”
A sister in Australia who has experienced a multitude of problems says : “ Preaching was the last thing I wanted to do , but an elder invited me to go with him .
I went .
Jehovah must have been helping ; each time I shared in the ministry , I felt so happy . ”
WHEN writing to fellow believers , the apostle Paul repeatedly expressed his hope that God and Christ would approve of the spirit that the congregations displayed .
What did he mean by “ the spirit you show ” ?

The Bible speaks well of “ the quiet and mild spirit ” and of being “ cool of spirit . ”

This “ air ” is the world’s spirit , or mental attitude , and it surrounds us like literal air .
It is everywhere . It is often manifested in the no - one - is - going - to - tell - me - what - to - do or the fight - for - your - rights attitude of so many people today .
They constitute “ the sons of disobedience ” of Satan’s world .
Perhaps he saw their imperfections .
Whatever the case , it is obvious that Korah began to look at things from a human viewpoint and spoke out against those appointed by Jehovah , disrespectfully telling them : “ That is enough of you . . .
How did some in the first century reveal that they had a bad attitude , and what might have been the reason for it ?
These men likely were dissatisfied with their privileges and tried to influence others against appointed men who were conscientiously carrying out God - given duties . ​ — Read 3 John 9 , 10 .
In what way might there be a need for caution in the congregation today ?
Obviously , such a spirit has no place in the Christian congregation .

A Christian’s spirit may also be tested if he is corrected or is relieved of privileges in the congregation .
( a ) Explain what we can learn from James 3 : 16 - 18 about a good spirit and a bad spirit . ( b ) What results from displaying “ the wisdom from above ” ?
In spite of all the injustice heaped upon him , the young man maintained respect for God - appointed authority . ​ — Read 1 Samuel 26 : 23 .
The brothers “ arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up to the apostles and older men in Jerusalem regarding this dispute . ”
“ He prayed in behalf of his companions . ”
Regarding ‘ the spirit we show , ’ what are you personally determined to do ?

THE preceding February , 122 pioneers converged on South Lansing , New York , to attend the 17th class of Gilead School .
Lowell and Bill , both from Michigan , Richard from Iowa , and Ramon from California soon became well - acquainted .
Some five months later , excitement was running high when it was announced that Brother Nathan Knorr from world headquarters was coming to speak to the students .
‘ Now we will actually get to know these dear brothers and sisters personally , ’ Lowell remembers thinking .
Finally Brother Erich Frost , the branch servant , appeared and greeted them warmly in English .
Toward the end of August , the four attended their first German convention , the “ Clean Worship ” Assembly in Frankfurt am Main .
The peak attendance of 47,432 and the fact that 2,373 were baptized renewed the brothers ’ missionary zeal and desire to preach .
Brother Frost , in his typically enthusiastic manner , began speaking in German about something apparently quite serious .
What had they done to set off such strong emotions ?
That is why Brother Frost said that until you have learned the language , speaking English with you is VERBOTEN . ”
Brother Frost’s counsel reflected his interest in the welfare of Jehovah’s organization and his love for his brothers .
* No wonder the four grew to love him !
From faithful German brothers and sisters ​ — too numerous to mention by name — ​ the four learned much , but they also learned from one another .
This attitude has stood us in good stead over the years and has made it easier for us to submit to theocratic direction . ”
The four friends also learned to appreciate one another’s strong points , even as Philippians 2 : 3 says : “ With lowliness of mind [ consider ] that the others are superior to you . ”
Full - time service had taught them that giving is more rewarding than receiving and that personal desires must rightfully be given lower priority than Kingdom interests .
For a friendship or a marriage to be truly lasting , Jehovah must be in the relationship .
They are precious gifts from Jehovah .
Almost 60 years of a very special four - way friendship shattered by death !
“ In all the 60 years of our friendship , I cannot remember any unpleasant moment ”

Shortly before he died , Bill wrote : “ In all the 60 years of our friendship , I cannot remember any unpleasant moment .
Our relationship has always been something very special to me . ”
To which his three friends , with a continuation of their friendship in the new world clearly in view , quickly add , “ And we only got started . ”

This startling development was posted on the official Web site of Jehovah’s Witnesses along with photos of Witnesses affected by the decision , including young children .
They have written cards and letters , and we have made up a small package of gifts that we would like to send to the children in Taganrog , just to let them know that very far away , there are other children who also faithfully serve Jehovah and who are thinking of them .
Moved by the expressions of encouragement from “ out of the mouth of children , ” a Witness serving at the Russia branch wrote to Cody and Larissa : “ You can imagine how unpleasant it is for both children and adults when they are punished for something that they have not done .

Jehovah’s name and purpose were highly esteemed by King David of ancient Israel .
He also appreciated the principles behind God’s Law and prayed to be taught to do His will , as this article shows .
COVER : Preaching in the small rural town of Albarracín in central Spain .
The Teruel Congregation , which has 78 publishers , has Albarracín and another 188 towns and villages in its territory

“ Teach me to do your will , for you are my God . ” ​ — PS .
143 : 10 .
Seeing things from the Creator’s elevated perspective will enable us to ‘ walk in the way ’ Jehovah approves . ​ — Isa .
30 : 21 .
11 : 4 .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What moved David to stand up to Goliath ?
Confronting Goliath , young David declared : “ You are coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin , but I am coming to you with the name of Jehovah of armies , the God of the battle lines of Israel , whom you have taunted . ”
Do you speak up when Jehovah’s name is being reproached , trusting in his support ?
But gaining a material reward was not David’s chief concern .
Surely we want to be like David , who sang : “ O magnify Jehovah with me , you people , and let us exalt his name together . ”
David’s courageous stand against Goliath required complete confidence in Jehovah .
Young David had strong faith .
And why should we hold back from talking to people we meet on the street while we are engaging in the house - to - house ministry ? ​ — Acts 20 : 20 , 21 .
In dealing with King Saul , how did David show that he kept Jehovah’s will in mind ?
Three times jealous Saul tried to pin David to the wall with a spear , but David moved out of the way each time , refusing to retaliate .
Finally , he fled from Saul .
Then Saul took 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and went looking for David in the wilderness .
But David said : “ It is unthinkable , on my part , from Jehovah’s standpoint , that I should do this thing to my lord , the anointed of Jehovah . ”
Saul was still God’s anointed king .
What did you learn from David about keeping God’s will uppermost in your mind ?
Rather than relying on his own ideas or giving in to another person’s urgings , David was eager to be taught by God .
He ‘ meditated on all of Jehovah’s activity and willingly kept himself concerned with the work of God’s own hands . ’
Why did David pour out the water that three of his men brought to him ?
David explained : “ It is unthinkable on my part , as regards my God , to do this ! Is it the blood of these men that I should drink at the risk of their souls ?
For it was at the risk of their souls that they brought it . ” ​ — 1 Chron .
David knew from the Law that blood should be poured out to Jehovah and not eaten .
He also understood why this should be done .
However , this was water , not blood . Why did David refuse to drink it ?
In fact , Solomon married many foreign women .
For instance , this is vital when contemplating marriage .
True worshippers are told to marry “ only in the Lord . ”
( Read Psalm 119 : 37 ; Matthew 5 : 28 , 29 ; Colossians 3 : 5 . )

Although David was exemplary in many ways , he committed several serious sins .
In effect , we will then be praying to Jehovah like the psalmist who made this humble request : “ Teach me to do your will . ”
Then he puts water into a basin and begins to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel .
He then puts on his outer garments .
Why did Jesus perform this humble act ? ​ — John 13 : 3 - 5 .
Jesus himself explained : “ Do you know what I have done to you ? . . .
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear , and I , for my part , was not rebellious .
How closely Jesus must have observed the example of Jehovah’s humility in exercising mercy toward sinful mankind !
Not every creature in heaven had the same attitude as the only - begotten Son of God .
Hence , he likely knew in advance that unpleasant experiences awaited him .
Why ?
Highlighting the humility of God’s only - begotten Son , the apostle Paul wrote : “ Although he was existing in God’s form , [ he ] gave no consideration to a seizure , namely , that he should be equal to God . No , but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men . ” ​ — Phil .
7 , 8 .
From his childhood on , Jesus left us a pattern of humility .
Although he was raised by imperfect parents ​ — Joseph and Mary — ​ Jesus humbly “ continued subject to them . ”
He himself lived that way .
What did Zechariah prophesy regarding the Messiah , and how was this fulfilled by Jesus ?
He is righteous , yes , saved ; humble , and riding upon an ass , even upon a full - grown animal the son of a she - ass . ”
This was fulfilled when Jesus entered Jerusalem before the Passover in the year 33 C.E .
Indeed , the whole city was set in commotion at his entry .

Jesus certainly was not harsh or oppressive .
11 : 30 .
How easy it would have been to ignore the pleas of the blind men !
What benefits have resulted from Jesus ’ course of humility ?
His example , his teachings , and his warm commendation stimulated them to progress spiritually .
How did Jesus benefit from being humble ?
Will he display humility ?
The cause in which he rides dictates that he will save only those who are humble and righteous .
Our developing humility , then , is essential to our survival .
A few of his apostles were arguing about who was the greatest among them .
Jesus , knowing the reasoning of their hearts , took a young child , set it beside him and said to them : ‘ Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me too , and whoever receives me receives him also that sent me forth .
Was Jesus ’ admonition to behave as a lesser one in accord with the values of the first - century Jews ?
The competitive environment in which we live and the spirit of the world might influence us to be egotistical , combative , or manipulative .
4 , 5 .
What can move us to cultivate humility ?
One way to cultivate humility is to ponder over the greatness of Jehovah in comparison to us .
He says : “ Based on my studies , I came to realize that current scientific theories alone are not likely to enable mankind to understand the universe completely .
So I switched to studying law . ”
6 , 7 . ( a ) Jehovah provides what astonishing example of humility ?
Although Jehovah is the one who makes the seeds that we plant and water grow , he bestows upon us an honorable position of working with him .
He sang to Jehovah : “ You will give me your shield of salvation , and it is your humility that makes me great . ”
In the way of qualities , abilities , and privileges , what do any of us have that we “ did not receive ” from Jehovah ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
“ A reasoning entered among them as to who would be the greatest of them , ” states Luke 9 : 46 .
In his letter to the Romans , he writes : “ Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another . ”
A person who behaves as a lesser one pursues peace with everyone and especially with his or her own cherished marriage mate .
On the other hand , the wife may prefer going out for a meal or visiting friends .
Would it not be easier for the wife to respect her husband when she sees that he manifests humility and gives sincere consideration to her likes and dislikes rather than being concerned only about his own preferences ?
The marriage bond is strengthened when each partner behaves as a lesser one . ​ — Read Philippians 2 : 1 - 4 .
Within the congregation .
In the world , many individuals live for the immediate gratification of their desires .
No wonder David encouraged his fellow Israelites to wait patiently for their God !
Although he may be able to assign a measure of blame to the other party , the humble Christian concerns himself with his own failings and is willing to admit them . ​ — Read Proverbs 6 : 1 - 5 .
By doing so , we will indeed prove to be more valuable as Jehovah’s servants .


11 : 1 - 4 .
But then came a powerful blow .
He would also be publicly humiliated for his errors .
Psalm 51 contains David’s touching pleas to Jehovah and clearly shows that he did more than admit his errors .
He pleaded with Jehovah : “ Create in me even a pure heart , O God , and put within me a new spirit , a steadfast one . . . .
Do restore to me the exultation of salvation by you , and may you support me even with a willing spirit . ”
However , in recognition of David’s repentant spirit ​ — he had “ a heart broken and crushed ” — ​ Jehovah forgave him .
Rather than have the adulterers condemned to death by human judges according to the Mosaic Law , Jehovah mercifully intervened , dealing with David and Bath - sheba himself .
God even made their son Solomon Israel’s next king . ​ — 1 Chron .
( b ) What factors move Jehovah to extend forgiveness ?
What a relief it is to know that Jehovah will forgive our sins ​ — even sins as serious as adultery or murder !
He will do so if we have a forgiving spirit , if we confess our sins before him , and if we manifest a changed attitude toward our bad actions .
“ Seasons of refreshing ” come from Jehovah when sinners sincerely repent . ​ — Read Acts 3 : 19 .

There he may have recalled these words of Moses to Israel : “ When you are in sore straits and all these words have found you out at the close of the days , then you will have to return to Jehovah your God and to listen to his voice . ”
David gratefully accepted this offer .
Therefore , Jehovah did not forgive them . Instead , he repeatedly had his prophets declare how he viewed their disobedient conduct .
When the people acted in harmony with Jehovah’s will , they experienced great joy . ​ — Neh .
( a ) For the nation of Israel as a whole , what were the consequences of their being unrepentant ?
Thus , the sinful and unrepentant nation was replaced by spiritual Israel .
How can we receive Jehovah’s forgiveness ?
Surely we ought to act as did David and Manasseh .
34 : 6 , 7 .

3 : 13 .
Why must we be willing to forgive ?
Why is it appropriate to consider your willingness to forgive ?
How do you think you would have felt toward Manasseh if his innocent victims had included one of your relatives ?
And if you suffer an affront or an injustice , what can help you to keep your emotions under control , react as Jehovah would want you to , and be willing to forgive ?
( b ) What is the point of Jesus ’ illustration recorded at Matthew 18 : 21 - 35 ?
18 : 21 - 34 .
Why is it not always easy to forgive ?
That is because reactions to personal offenses are often emotional .
What can help you to respond in a forgiving way if you have been upset by the unkind conduct of others ?
Emotional responses to real or supposed offenses can be very strong .
As this experience illustrates , giving yourself time to calm down and view the situation more dispassionately may help you to avoid responding in an unforgiving way that you may later regret . ​ — Ps .
14 : 29 ; Jas .
Is it because you have been treated unfairly , perhaps discourteously ?
4 : 12 .

( b ) How can adopting a positive , forgiving spirit change your outlook on life ?
How will you react ? You have read about episodes of road rage in which an individual became so angry that he attacked the other driver .
The point of this scenario is that we can lessen anger , disappointment , and other negative emotions with understanding , open - mindedness , and a willingness to forgive .
When Jesus sent out 70 preachers , he told them to wish peace upon every house they visited .
What then ?
In any case , we should be able to leave each door with peace in our hearts , regardless of how people treat us .
If we were to respond to a provocation by getting upset , we could not maintain our peace .
Strive to maintain your peace in all situations , not just in the Christian ministry .
Naturally , willingness to forgive others does not mean that you have to approve of their wrong behavior or minimize the damage it does .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ ‘ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink ; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head . ’
Regardless of how badly a person has treated you , why should you refrain from harboring resentment ?
Under some circumstances , it would be inappropriate to have fellowship with certain people .
If such an individual has hurt you , it might be extremely difficult to forgive him even if he repents , since emotional wounds take time to heal .
If possible , as far as it depends upon you , be peaceable with all men .
What realization regarding offenders should affect our attitude toward them ?
Hence , what they decide in such matters after seeking Jehovah’s help in prayer will reflect his point of view . ​ — Matt .
But when I get there , whatever men you approve of by letters , these I shall send to carry your kind gift to Jerusalem . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
When Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome about 56 C.E . , the collection was almost complete .
He said : “ I am about to journey to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones .
The spirit shown by first - century Christians is clear from what Paul said of the Macedonians .
He said : “ Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver . ”
It is also possible for you to send donations directly to a legal entity that is used by Jehovah’s Witnesses in your country .
The address of the branch office can be found on www.jw.org .
Real Estate : Salable real estate donated to an entity used by Jehovah’s Witnesses , either by making an outright gift or , in the case of residential property , by reserving a life estate to the donor , who can continue to live in the residence during his or her lifetime .
For more information , you may contact the Charitable Planning Office , either in writing or by telephone , at the address listed below , or you may contact the branch office that serves your country .
For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb , and there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men , and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs on account of the kingdom of the heavens .
19 : 10 - 12 .
However , there were also those who freely made themselves eunuchs .
Building upon what Jesus said , the apostle Paul explained that while all Christians ​ — single or married — ​ can serve God acceptably , single ones who are ‘ settled in their heart ’ about their status “ do better . ”
Married people must divide their time and energy to please and care for their mate .
Thus , the Scriptures tell us that a Christian does not receive the gift of singleness in some mysterious way .

“ It occurred to me that we could use those logs to build radio towers , ” Brother Naish later related , “ and thus the idea for a theocratic radio station was born . ”
Just one year later ​ — in 1924 — ​ CHUC went on the air .
It was one of the first radio stations broadcasting religious subjects in Canada .
“ I thought the books would help me to teach Sunday school , ” he later wrote .
He became a zealous evangelizer , and until his death in 1998 , he served Jehovah faithfully .
In its time , however , the radio certainly played a mighty role in broadcasting ‘ the best message ever heard . ’ ​ — From our archives in Canada .

COVER : There are more than 100,000 Witnesses in South Korea .
Because they are politically neutral and refuse to bear arms against their fellow man , many are in prison .
John Chrysostom of the late fourth century wrote that “ the devil will not dare to approach a house where a Gospel is lying . ”
Perhaps a more common misuse of the Bible is the practice of bibliomancy .
The practice of bibliomancy and other superstitious uses of the Bible are common .

How can you be lastingly successful ?
Ask people that question , and you will find that their answers vary greatly .
And you know that Joshua did prove to be successful .
To that end , consider the lives of two men mentioned in the Bible .
What did Solomon conclude about those who are successful before God ?
And he realized that such pleasures are truly meaningful for the one who has God’s approval , who has a good relationship with Him .
For years , Solomon walked in the fear of God .
While we may not expect to do the same , Solomon’s example when he was faithful to God should show us how to evaluate what is real success and should thus help us to achieve it .
Have you not seen that many lovers of wealth yearn to have ever more ?
How tragic !
“ We have become as the refuse of the world , the offscouring of all things , until now . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
As a young man named Saul , the apostle Paul seemed to have so much going for him .
Born into what may have been a prominent family , he studied with Gamaliel , a respected teacher , and later wrote : “ I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age . ”
Paul loved Jehovah and desired his approval more than riches and prominence among men .
That is a goal that is lacking on the world’s agenda for success .
Why did you choose to rest your hope on God ?
( Read Mark 10 : 29 , 30 . )
6 : 19 - 21 .
In a sense , it could include any of those things that Solomon wrote about that have to do with being successful in the eyes of men ​ — prestige , fame , or power .
[ Jesus ] loves human beings .
Jesus does not want [ his ] disciples [ to be ] disappointed .
Some religious leaders have preached that it is wrong to strive after success and that all effort to succeed should be stifled .
Note , though , that Jesus was not condemning all such effort .
Nevertheless , we can have every confidence in Jesus ’ wise advice : “ Never be anxious and say , ‘ What are we to eat ? ’
or , ‘ What are we to drink ? ’
For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing . For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things .
6 : 31 - 33 .
To the former , Paul’s counsel “ to work at good , to be rich in fine works , to be liberal , ready to share ” was valid .
Strive to be faithful whatever your circumstances are .
Be confident that Jehovah will bless you richly ​ — now and throughout eternity .
Never forget the words that Jesus directed to anointed Christians : “ Prove yourself faithful even to death , and I will give you the crown of life . ”


“ You do not belong to yourselves . ” ​ — 1 COR .
Consider , for example , the comments Jesus made about one “ slave ” shortly before His death .
It is significant that in a parallel account , that slave is called a “ steward . ”
It may have been Eliezer whom Abraham sent to Mesopotamia to choose a wife for his son Isaac .
Abraham’s great - grandson Joseph looked after the household of Potiphar .
Appointed to shepherd “ the flock of God , ” overseers give direction and take the lead in the congregations .
Of course , responsibilities vary .
Still , all are expected to carry out their duties faithfully ; all must “ render an account ” to God . ​ — Heb .
13 : 17 .
How do we know that , in a sense , all Christians are stewards ?
How did Jesus illustrate the relationship between master and slave ?
Paul recognized that this stewardship meant both scrupulously caring for the “ sacred secrets ” and faithfully imparting such to others as directed by the Master , Jesus Christ . ​ — 1 Cor .
15 - 17 . ( a ) Why is it essential that a steward be faithful ?
( b ) How did Jesus illustrate the consequences of unfaithfulness ?
Hand in the account of your stewardship , for you can no longer manage the house . ’ ”
Because the steward squandered the property of his master , the master dismissed him .
Problems may arise when we compare ourselves with others .
If so , why not try to step up our activities ?
Another aspect to consider is what responsibilities we have or yearn to have .
Recall that Moses seemed ready to lead the Israelites out of Egypt , but he had to wait 40 years before doing so .
This allowed him enough time to develop qualities he needed to lead a stiff - necked and rebellious people . ​ — Acts 7 : 22 - 25 , 30 - 34 .
However , God chose David , a much younger man , to be king .
Jonathan accepted his situation , and unlike his father , he did not become jealous of David .
Quite the opposite .
While doing that , we enjoy great freedom as to how we will handle our responsibilities .

“ I exhort you as aliens and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires . ” ​ — 1 PET .
2 : 11 .
Why can the anointed be called temporary residents ?
What are you longing for as far as the future is concerned ?
Clearly , by the term “ the ones chosen , ” Peter referred to those who , like him , had been anointed by holy spirit and given “ a new birth to a living hope ” to rule with Christ in the heavens .
Since 1914 , what step have millions taken , and why ?
Since 1914 , millions have therefore chosen to become willing subjects of God’s enthroned King , Christ Jesus .
They have no desire to be a part of Satan’s world system .
In what sense can Jehovah’s Witnesses be called aliens ?
Yes , Jehovah’s Witnesses are law - abiding citizens in over 200 countries , yet regardless of where they live , they are like aliens .
Loyal servants of God will be in a position to become permanent residents of the earthly Paradise .
That advice was first directed to anointed Christians , but it is equally valid for Jesus ’ other sheep .
Peter , though , correctly limited the “ fleshly desires ” of which he was speaking to those that “ carry on a conflict against the soul . ”

However , other people may praise them for their way of life .
A similar conclusion was recently reached in connection with Jehovah’s Witnesses living in Moscow , Russia .
When Jehovah’s Witnesses conduct themselves as “ temporary residents ” in the present system , they are not doing so as part of some silent civil protest ; neither do they oppose or interfere with others who make their own political or social decisions .
By obeying public officials in accord with Peter’s counsel to “ have honor for the king , ” Christians show the respect and honor that accords with the positions of those officials .
Therefore , it is only natural for them to “ have love for the whole association of brothers . ”
Have you heard similar reactions of people who observed the Witnesses at a convention that you have attended ?
Their hope that they will shortly become permanent residents of God’s new world of righteousness is strong and well - founded .

And as for you , the priests of Jehovah you will be called . ” ​ — ISA .
That was also the case with the ancient Israelites , who by means of the Law covenant were in a special relationship with Jehovah God .
It is therefore called “ the Israel of God . ”
In that sense , then , there were to be no foreigners in the Christian congregation .
( c ) What do the two groups have in common ?
Indeed , both the anointed and the “ other sheep ” find and then lovingly shepherd honest individuals who are desirous of serving God forever . ​ — John 10 : 16 .
All the while , Abraham maintained his friendship with Jehovah .
He kept his eyes focused , not settling down to become a permanent resident in some nation .
Why become overly attached to what is only temporary ?
Jehovah is still inviting people of all nations to be blessed through Abraham’s seed .
Why might some people view Jehovah’s Witnesses as strange or as “ foreigners ” ?
Foreigners are often recognized by characteristics common to their minority group .
Thus , in actuality a foreigner is simply a person viewed as such because he is different in certain ways .
Could anything approaching that be possible now for people in all nations around the globe ?
In a selfish and nationalistic world , it is refreshing to find individuals who can and do look beyond national borders .
Granted , overcoming prejudices can be difficult .
I began to view the word ‘ foreign ’ as pejorative and created a rule within CNN that the word could not be used either on air or in conversation around the office .
On the contrary , it is totally reasonable to believe that it will happen .
As far as legal requirements permitted , national barriers were ignored when such consolidations were made .

( Read Zephaniah 3 : 9 . )

In July 2011 , the first issue of a simplified study edition of this magazine was published in the English language .
Moreover , in time a simplified edition in French , Portuguese , and Spanish will be available .
A sister who was baptized in 1984 expressed appreciation for the simplified edition : “ I feel that it was written just for me .
Each couple is responsible before Jehovah to decide what to do .
It might help , though , to get an overview of this assisted reproductive technology .
Medical personnel surgically harvested a mature egg from her , placed it in a glass dish , and fertilized it with her husband’s sperm .
In time , she had a baby girl .
If the first IVF attempt failed , some of those reserve embryos could be used in a subsequent IVF cycle at a lower cost .
However , this raises ethical issues .
In 2008 , a chief embryologist noted in The New York Times that many patients were genuinely torn about what to do with the extra embryos .
Embryos can remain viable for a decade or more if they are frozen properly but not all of them survive when they are thawed . ”
( Italics ours . )
Christian couples who face issues raised by IVF may well reflect on the implications of a different medical situation .
In some situations , though , life - support technology is the only thing sustaining a loved one .
Without the artificial environment of the freezer , the embryos would soon deteriorate to the point of no longer being viable .

Because a couple submitted to IVF to achieve pregnancy and hopefully have a baby , they might choose to bear the cost of keeping their reserve embryos frozen or they might choose to use them in a future IVF attempt to have a child .
Christians facing this decision are responsible before God to use their Bible - trained conscience .
Christians facing this decision will be responsible before God to use their Bible - trained conscience
She might then allow the resulting embryos to be implanted in her .
* Those reproductive procedures are unacceptable to God’s servants out of respect for his direction : “ You must not give your emission as semen to the wife of your associate to become unclean by it . ”
5 : 11 ; 6 : 9 , 18 ; Heb .
In the document they pledge to be faithful to each other and to legalize their union if that becomes possible .
The congregation would view them as having gone on record before God and man to be faithful to each other so that their union could be treated as if validated by civil authorities .
Jehovah instituted human marriage and regards it highly .
If , for example , a man engages in sex relations outside of marriage , his innocent wife can decide whether to divorce him or not .
Rather , it taught that divorce cannot be granted for any reason .
That allowance is a compassionate arrangement of the Christian congregation in such lands .
However , it is not a provision to be used in most countries where divorce is possible , even if the process is somewhat expensive or complex .
In the case in question , the man and woman who are living together immorally want to marry .
Consequently , signing a Declaration Pledging Faithfulness is not an option there .
Note that with this couple it is not as if either needed to obtain a divorce but is being prevented from getting one .
They might have to go to another land where his status will not be an obstacle .
21 : 22 , 23 ; Ps .




Well , see if you can answer the following questions :

Already The Watchtower is published in 204 languages .
How do you feel about December 21 , 2012 , the date on the Maya calendar that many have been saying would bring worldwide change ?
Depending on what you expected , you might be relieved , disappointed , or indifferent .
Many have simply grown tired of being told that the end is near .
After God created the earth , he said that it “ was very good , ” and he still feels that way .
Does this not show that the earth will be burned up ?
Actually , the Bible sometimes uses the terms “ heavens , ” “ earth , ” and “ fire ” figuratively , as symbols .

Verses 5 and 6 draw a parallel with the Flood of Noah’s day .
Just as a surgeon might remove a cancerous tumor to save a patient’s life , God will “ cut off ” the wicked so that good people can truly enjoy life on earth .
Such a positive view of “ the end of the world ” is implied by the Bible translations that render this expression “ the conclusion of the system of things ” or “ the end of the age . ”

In the book The Last Days Are Here Again , Professor Richard Kyle writes that “ sudden change and social chaos create an atmosphere conducive to predictions of the end of the world . ”
That is especially the case when the change and chaos seem hard to explain .
Instead , they were inspired by God to describe conditions that would indicate an imminent end of the world .

Many proud , highly educated religious leaders did not get the sense of Jesus ’ message , but humble fishermen did .
HISTORY : PRODIGAL SON
As Jehovah’s Witnesses , my parents did their best to instill Bible principles in us when we were young .
I reasoned that absolute freedom was the only way to be truly happy .
From that day forward , I said yes to many other destructive practices .
Yet , I felt that the damage had been done and that there was no turning back .
I reluctantly went along .
To my surprise , so did my two siblings who had also strayed .
My siblings , also moved by what they had experienced at that convention , decided to return as well .
You can imagine the joy of my parents and faithful younger brother when our family was finally united in worshipping Jehovah .
The Bible empowered me to stop using and selling drugs and become a productive member of society .
These people truly love one another , and they are united in serving God .
This work has brought me the greatest happiness of all .
Abel wanted nothing more than that . Abel speaks to you today .
So how can he speak to us ?
Abel was the first human ever to develop that sterling quality .
If we learn from his faith and seek to imitate it , then the record of Abel is speaking to us in a very real and effective way .
Jesus later associated Abel with “ the founding of the world . ”
Her words suggest that she may have had in mind the promise Jehovah made in the garden , foretelling that a certain woman would produce a “ seed ” that would one day destroy the wicked one who had led Adam and Eve astray .
What is more , if she and Adam fed Cain such ideas as he grew up , they surely did his imperfect human pride no good .
They named him Abel , which may mean “ Exhalation , ” or “ Vanity . ”
Did the choice of that name reflect lower expectations , as if they put less hope in Abel than in Cain ?
Cain took up farming ; Abel took up shepherding .
How , then , did he develop faith in Jehovah God ?

Abel surely took time to ponder spiritual matters .
A shepherd’s life required a great deal of walking .
In creation , Abel found a solid basis for faith in a loving Creator
Thus , Abel had rich food for meditation .
When Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden , Jehovah made sure that neither they nor their offspring would gain access to that earthly Paradise .
Day and night , year after year , decade after decade , those intelligent , powerful creatures stayed right in that spot .
Surely that angelic example strengthened his faith .
God surely did not need any gift or help from humans .
He selected the best , the firstlings , and offered up what seemed to be the choicest pieces .
But his motives were not like those of Abel .
We read : “ Jehovah was looking with favor upon Abel and his offering . ”
How God made his favor evident , the account does not say .
Did Abel realize how valuable such a sacrifice would be ?
Many centuries after Abel’s time , God used the sacrifice of an unblemished lamb to picture the sacrifice of His own perfect Son , “ the Lamb of God , ” whose innocent blood would be shed .
The expression “ the founding of the world ” involves the idea of casting down seed , suggesting procreation , so it has to do with the earliest human offspring .
Why , though , did Jesus connect Abel with “ the founding of the world ” and not Cain , who was the first human born ?
Wouldn’t it be reasonable for God to have a name ?
Many translations of the Bible contain God’s personal name at Psalm 83 : 18 .
We use personal names when we talk with those we love , such as our close friends

We can choose whether to be close to him or not .
▪ Serving Without Regrets

What was Elsebeth’s reaction to the invitation ?
I prayed a lot to Jehovah and spoke with my family and with experienced brothers . ”
To prepare herself for the possible move , she began pioneering in her hometown .
“ My income was drastically reduced , but it worked out fine , ” says Roald .
Elsebeth relates : “ My husband asked me to try to find a house in Lakselv and to rent out our house in Bergen .
He says : “ With the help of Jehovah and many prayers in which we asked for his help to make changes , we were able to make the move . ”
First , they spent more time on Bible study .
Then , the couple sold their house , quit their jobs , and moved in August 2011 to the city of Alta , in northern Norway .
Before long , Knut and Lisbeth felt ready to make the move , and a big one at that ​ — to Uganda .

At the end of his life , in his farewell address , he said : “ You must be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses by never turning away from it to the right or to the left . ”
We too need the courage to obey Jehovah at all times . This includes occasions when mere men demand that we act contrary to God’s will .
This book of the law should not depart from your mouth , and you must in an undertone read in it day and night , in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it ; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely . ”
Joshua followed that counsel , and ‘ his way was successful . ’
Jehovah your God is with you . ” ​ — Joshua 1 : 9
The yeartext for 2013 is drawn from what scripture , and how do you feel that those words will help you ?
So let us “ not suffer shock or be terrified ” regardless of our trials .
Especially noteworthy is the statement : “ Be courageous and strong . . . . Jehovah your God is with you . ”
Those words of Joshua 1 : 9 have been chosen as the yeartext for 2013 .
In what ways did Rahab show faith and courage ?
Along the road , Naomi urged Ruth to return to her own people , but the Moabitess replied : “ Do not plead with me to abandon you , to turn back from accompanying you . . .

But if not , let it become known to you , O king , that your gods are not the ones we are serving , and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship . ”
Although we are not likely to be threatened with death in a fiery furnace , we do face tests of integrity and can be sure that God will bless us for our faith and courage .
They courageously acted in harmony with Jesus ’ words : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , that you also love one another . ”
The Mosaic Law required that a person love his neighbor as he loved himself .
But Jesus ’ commandment was “ new ” in describing love that would go to the point of giving our life for others , as he did .
“ Very few of the Christians recanted , ” wrote Daniel P .
All a prisoner had to do was scatter a pinch of incense on the flame and he was given a Certificate of Sacrifice and turned free .

What Biblical examples of faith and courage can help us to carry out our preaching work ?
How grateful we are for Jesus ’ matchless example !
When certain persecuted followers of Christ prayed that they might ‘ speak God’s word with boldness , ’ that plea was answered .
( Read Acts 4 : 29 - 31 . )
So is his Son , the Head of the congregation .
See more examples of courage in the article “ Be Courageous and Very Strong ” in The Watchtower of February 15 , 2012 .
“ Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve . ” ​ — JOSH .
24 : 15 .
How can you show balance in your approach to recreation and entertainment ?
For example , Cain had to decide whether to act on his anger or to control it .
Joshua’s goal was to stay close to Jehovah ; hence , he chose a path that took him in that direction .
In this article and in the next , we will examine seven areas of life in which we should let nothing distance us from Jehovah .
Christians are obligated to support themselves and their families .
Clearly , secular employment is an important part of life , but if you are not careful , employment and career could distance you from Jehovah .
What factors are important when we consider a job offer ?
Should you accept the offer anyway , thinking that an unsuitable job is better than no job ?
Whether you are looking for work or you are reevaluating your current employment , how can you make wise decisions ?
( b ) Which goal will bring you closer to Jehovah , and why ?
Ask yourself , ‘ Where do I want a job or career to take me ? ’
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 9 , 10 . )
8 , 9 .
He works and works , and then he brings home luxuries rather than necessities .
As a result , we’re known as the family that has a lot of money rather than as the family that encourages others in spiritual pursuits .
If you are a young person who is contemplating a career , how can you choose the right path ?

Is your goal to imitate the lifestyle of people whose happiness rises and falls depending on the size of their bank account or stock portfolio ?
The Bible even says that there is “ a time to laugh ” and “ a time to skip about , ” and it encourages a healthy amount of rest .
How ?
What type of associates does your choice of recreation and entertainment bring you into contact with ?
Does it stimulate in you a desire to commit wrong acts ? ​ — Jas .
For example , as a pioneer , I wake up at 6 : 00 a.m . for field service , so I can’t be socializing until one or two in the morning .
It is normal , therefore , to be deeply grieved when a beloved family member leaves Jehovah .
I felt guilty , and I blamed myself . ”
Ultimately , Jehovah holds the sinner ​ — not you — ​ responsible for his or her choice .
Also , do not blame others .
Take your stand against the Devil ​ — not against shepherds who act to protect the congregation . ​ — 1 Pet .
19 , 20 . ( a ) What can parents of disfellowshipped children do to cope with their grief ?
( b ) What hope do such parents rightly entertain ?
Do not isolate yourself from your faithful Christian brothers and sisters .
Do not look for excuses to associate with a disfellowshipped family member , for example , through e - mail .
Each year , many wrongdoers repent and come back to Jehovah’s organization .
Jehovah does not begrudge their repentance .
Make it your determination to allow nothing to distance you from Jehovah .
The next article will discuss four more areas in which you can demonstrate that resolve .
Used improperly , they can come between us and our heavenly Father .
It is even more tragic to sacrifice your intimacy with Jehovah through misuse or overuse of technology .
5 , 6 . ( a ) What responsibilities do parents have toward their children ?
Parents , you need not control your children’s every move , but you do need to monitor their computer use .
Do not abandon them to online immorality , violent games , spiritism , and bad association just to keep them busy and out of your way .
As parents , it is your job to shield your children ​ — including teenagers — ​ from anything that could distance them from Jehovah .
Imagine what a mother bear would do if someone threatened her cubs ! ​ — Compare Hosea 13 : 8 .
And remember , your children need you to spend time with them !
Because our first parents allowed Satan to distance them from Jehovah , we are all subject to illness .
They may sincerely believe that they are helping others .
Those signs can be evidence of maturity , dignity , and inner beauty .
How can money become a snare ?
Jesus made it clear that “ no one ” can successfully serve both God and riches . ​ — Matt .
What sort of financial snares are common today , and how can we avoid them ?
Others have been fooled by offers of unrealistically high returns on investments .
Yet , many in the world around us believe that only by devoting themselves to making money can they have a secure future and take it easy later in life .
( Read Luke 12 : 15 - 21 . )
“ If I pour out a little too much shampoo , I put some back in the bottle . ”
Instead , they dropped sharply .
He found it difficult to focus on spiritual matters , and he lost sleep .
How does pride that is good differ from pride that is bad ?
A healthy measure of self - respect helps us to make good decisions and to avoid lowering our moral standards .
Instead of longing for a position in the congregation , enjoy your work in the ministry ! 17 , 18 . ( a ) Cite Bible examples of humble people as well as of proud people . ( b ) How did one brother avoid letting pride distance him from Jehovah ?
“ I expected to be recommended as an elder soon , ” Ryan relates , “ but a year went by without that happening . ”
Would he stop attending meetings , letting pride distance him from Jehovah and His people ?
I needed to let Jehovah train me . ”
Soon he was conducting several progressive Bible studies .
( b ) What examples can we imitate of those who stayed close to Jehovah ?
We understand that secular work and money can help us to care for our needs .
We know that recreation can refresh us and that technology can be useful .
Draw close to Jehovah , and stay close to him .
We have many Bible examples to instruct us in this regard .
Enoch and Noah “ walked with the true God . ”
Moses “ continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible . ”
Jesus had God’s constant support because he always did what was pleasing to his heavenly Father .
Imitate such examples .
Names have been changed .
A POET wrote : “ Of all sad words of tongue or pen , the saddest are these : ‘ It might have been ! ’ ” The poet was J . G .
Which are you ?
Let us see what his example can teach us about serving without regrets .
The Bible record states that immediately after the martyring of Stephen , “ Saul [ later known as Paul ] . . . began to deal outrageously with the congregation . Invading one house after another and , dragging out both men and women , he would turn them over to prison . ”
Later , he again mentioned his regrettable past when writing to the Corinthians , to the Philippians , and to Timothy .
Bible scholar Frederic W .
Farrar added that it is only when we weigh the terrible significance of this sad period in Paul’s life that “ we feel the load of remorse which must have lain upon him , and the taunts to which he was liable from malignant enemies . ”
How did Paul feel about the mercy and love that Jehovah and Jesus displayed toward him , and what lesson does that teach us ?
Paul deeply appreciated the merciful way in which he was treated , and he wanted to make sure that God’s undeserved kindness had not been extended to him in vain .
So he “ labored in excess ” of all the other apostles .
9 , 10 . ( a ) Why do some of Jehovah’s people have regrets ?
Have you ever wasted valuable energy and time on the wrong pursuits ?
To worry continually means to plague oneself , vex oneself , persecute oneself .
Imagine trying to move forward by rocking for hours in a rocking chair , expending all that energy but getting nowhere !
You can apologize to the person you wronged , perhaps restoring good relations .
You can avoid whatever led up to the wrong act , thereby preventing future problems .
Then again , you may simply have to live through some situations of life .
( b ) What is the divine formula for acquiring peace of mind about our past failings ?
Jehovah’s mercy and loving - kindness can be extended to them , even as it has been to so many others .
Jehovah will look kindly upon a humble , honest one and upon his heartfelt repentance .
God did that for Job , who said : “ I do repent [ “ feel regret , ” ftn . ] in dust and ashes . ”
We all must follow the divine formula for acquiring peace of mind : “ He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed , but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy . ”
( See the box . )
What brought David pardon and relief ?
Only a confession to God .
If past wrongs trouble you , rectify them to the extent that you can and then believe Jehovah’s assurance that he has forgiven you ! ​ — Ps .
( b ) What questions can move us to analyze our present situation in life ?
It has been said that life can be understood by looking back but that it must be lived by looking ahead .
What are we doing right now , or failing to do , that years from now we will wish we had not done or had done differently ?
Did I make a real effort to put on the new personality ?
15 , 16 . ( a ) What sacrifices have many made to put God’s service first in their life ?
Should you feel that the sacrifices you made were unnecessary or ill - timed ?
You need not think that you would have been better off had you lived your life differently .
Paul did not dwell on the wrong course he had pursued in Judaism .
All of us can apply the principle behind Paul’s words .
Rather than fretting over our past , dwelling on what cannot be undone , we should stretch forward to what lies ahead .
We can strive to put the past behind us , serve God to the best of our ability now , and look ahead to the glorious future !
Rather , in Hebrew , to feel regret can mean to change one’s mind or intention .
18 : 7 - 10 .
IT WAS the year 55 C.E . The apostle Paul was in the harbor city of Troas , but he could not stop thinking about Corinth .
( b ) What questions will we consider ?

Rather than making rigid rules for the congregation , elders rely on Scriptural principles and direction from Jehovah’s organization .
Paul also stated : “ We are fellow workers for your joy . ”
Today , Christian elders have the same desire .
They want to do all they can to help their brothers to “ serve Jehovah with rejoicing . ” ​ — Ps .
100 : 2 ; Phil .
We will consider the responses to what question , and on what should we reflect ?
Recently , a group of zealous brothers and sisters living in different parts of the world were invited to respond to the question , “ What words and deeds of an elder have added to your joy ? ”
Many of our brothers and sisters say that their joy is enhanced when elders show personal interest in them .
He concluded one of his letters by greeting more than 25 brothers and sisters by name , including Persis , a Christian sister about whom Paul said : “ Greet Persis our beloved one . ” ​ — Rom .
Some elders have a hard time remembering names .
Whenever an elder does that , he tells his brothers , in effect : ‘ I noticed what you did .
I care about you . ’
So when an elder commends me for something I’ve done for the congregation , it’s so refreshing , so energizing !
( Read Acts 20 : 28 . )
Today , elders want to do the same .
Prior to making a shepherding visit , an elder needs to take some time to think about the individual he will visit .
What are the person’s challenges ?
During shepherding visits , an elder allows his brothers and sisters to express themselves while he listens attentively .
To illustrate why even a strong servant of God may , at times , need help from a companion , let us consider an event in King David’s life .
His name was Ishbi - benob , also one of the Rephaim .
The record states : “ David grew tired . ”
Worldwide , we as Jehovah’s people are carrying out our ministry despite the obstacles that Satan and his agents place in our path .
He wrote to the Corinthians : “ I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for your souls . ”
She and her family are members of the indigenous Mapuche people .
After giving her an invitation and a brief explanation , María Isabel asked the woman for her address so that she and her parents could visit her to tell her more about God’s Kingdom .
Also , pray for Jehovah’s holy spirit to help you to muster up courage to speak about him .
If you do so , you too may be pleasantly surprised and much encouraged by the results of your well - planned effort .
DRAW CLOSE TO GOD
* How sure is that promise ?
Jehovah spoke of those three dead patriarchs as if they were still alive .
That , in turn , would mean that death is stronger than Jehovah ​ — as if he were too weak to free his faithful servants from the grip of death .
Matthew 22 - 28 – Mark 1 - 8
In all that God asked him to do ​ — from an assignment as daunting as confronting mighty Pharaoh to a task as seemingly simple as stretching out his rod over the Red Sea — ​ Moses obeyed .
Moses showed love for his fellow Israelites .
They recognized that Jehovah was using Moses to guide his people , so they approached Moses with their various problems .
We read : “ The people kept standing before Moses from the morning till the evening . ”
Besides listening to them , Moses also prayed for his loved ones .
For example , when Moses ’ sister , Miriam , murmured against Moses , Jehovah struck her with leprosy .
Heal her , please ! ” What else but love would have caused Moses to offer such a selfless prayer ?
We also benefit ourselves .
*
Someone who has faith in God is confident that He will fulfill all of His promises .
Moses may have had little idea that God was about to part the Red Sea , thereby opening up an escape route for the Israelites .
And Moses wanted his fellow Israelites to have that same conviction .
We read : “ Moses said to the people : ‘ Do not be afraid .
Moses ’ faith benefited not only himself but everyone who learned from it .
We can imitate Moses by centering our life on God’s promises .
But we can be sure that when we do our best to keep our life simple and focused on our worship , Jehovah will provide all that we need .
We also strive to help others to grow in faith .
I was born in Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , the last of four children .
I was proud to be a Mormon and made it my goal to become a missionary .
When I was 18 years old , my family relocated to the United States with the intention of furthering my college education .
I was impressed that everyone around me was looking up the scriptures and taking notes .
There were many things about the Mormon faith that I had accepted , but I wasn’t really sure how the Scriptures compared with those ideas .
That moved me to search through the official Mormon Web site to confirm that what was stated in Awake !
In addition to doctrinal discrepancies , I was troubled by the nationalistic ideas taught by the Mormons .
I wondered how the country of my birth ​ — or any other country — ​ would fit into this picture .
The social status that would naturally come with being a missionary also appealed to me .
But as far as God was concerned , I didn’t really know that much about him .
I always knew that God existed , but now I could speak to him in prayer as my best Friend .
His desire for glory was stronger than his desire to please God . ​ — Read Matthew 4 : 8 , 9 ; James 1 : 13 , 14 .
You can find the answers to these questions in the Bible .
Often , when a man receives a little authority , his humility ​ — or lack thereof — ​ quickly becomes evident .
But if you wish to know what a man really is , give him power . ”
Perhaps a proud man would have done so .
But not Moses .
We never want to let power , authority , or natural ability go to our head .
When we cultivate genuine humility , we make life easier for the people around us , endearing ourselves to them .
CARLO : * “ Our son , Angelo , has Down syndrome .
You were no doubt eager to hold the baby .
For parents like Carlo and Mia , however , joy becomes mingled with anxiety when they are told that their child is sick or disabled .
Do you have a disabled child ?
Consider three common challenges you might face and how the wisdom found in the Bible can help you .
In a sense , you may need to “ grieve ” for what was lost ​ — the health of your child .
It will take time to sort out your emotions and adapt to your new situation .
At first , it will be difficult , but you can learn it .
“ This helped us to understand not only the problems that we could expect but also the ‘ positive ’ aspects of Down syndrome , ” they say .
“ We saw that our son could lead a life that in many respects would be normal .
This comforted us a lot . ”
TRY THIS : Focus on what your child can do .
Ben says , “ Most people will never really understand what our life is like . ”
SUGGESTION : Ask for help .
And accept it when it is offered .
How can you find time to look after your health ?
Will prayer really help ?
SUGGESTION : To reassure all your children that you are interested in them , plan activities that they enjoy .
“ At times , we do something special for our eldest son , ” says Jenney , quoted earlier , “ even if we just have lunch at his favorite restaurant . ” Show interest in all your children
TRY THIS : Commend your other children for any support that they give to your ill child .
“ Concentrate on the wonderful things about your child , because there are many of them . ”
According to such claims , Judas was actually a hero , the apostle who best understood Jesus , delivering him for execution at Jesus ’ request .
In 2000 , it was purchased by a Swiss antiquities dealer .
In a work called Against Heresies , Irenaeus writes concerning one of the many groups whose teachings he opposed : “ They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things , and that he alone , knowing the truth as none of the others did , accomplished the mystery of the betrayal .
Irenaeus was especially intent on refuting various teachings of Gnostic Christians , who claimed that they held revealed inner knowledge .
* Some of those Gnostics believed that the physical world was a prison .
In their translation , Judas is favored by Jesus as the one disciple who would understand the mysteries and “ reach ” the “ kingdom . ”
The misled apostles would name a replacement for Judas , but he would then become the “ thirteenth spirit , ” which would “ exceed all [ the other disciples ] ” because , says Jesus , “ you will sacrifice the man that clothes me . ”
None of the scholars who analyzed this text claim that it contains accurate historical information
The definitive conclusion held by DeConick and Pearson is that in this “ Gospel of Judas , ” Judas is no hero .
It is not a Gospel written in Judas’s own time by someone who actually knew him . . .

54 : 17 , Byington .
What has Jehovah lovingly preserved for the benefit of mankind ?
It is sure to last , for “ the saying [ or , “ word , ” Byington ] of Jehovah endures forever . ”
In his written Word , what has God preserved for the use of his people ?
The Scriptures first mention “ Jehovah God ” in “ a history of the heavens and the earth . ”
For instance , the first commandment began : “ I am Jehovah your God . ”
God’s name lives on because the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has preserved his Word and his name despite all satanic efforts to eliminate them . ​ — Ps .
73 : 28 .
Though religious error abounds , what has God preserved ?
Says Collins Cobuild English Dictionary : “ A country’s heritage is all the qualities , traditions , or features of life there that have continued over many years and have been passed on from one generation to another . ”
That privilege became part of our spiritual legacy at our convention in Columbus , Ohio , U.S.A . , in 1931 .
“ I will never forget the tremendous shout and applause that vibrated through that meeting place , ” recalled one brother .
No one else in the world wanted that name , but God has blessed us in the use of it for over eight decades .
What a special privilege it is to be Jehovah’s Witnesses !
Christian traditions were also handed down orally or by example .
Among these were points regarding the Lord’s Evening Meal that the apostle Paul passed on to Christian congregations .
Our legacy includes what heartening promise ?
This makes us feel secure , even when we are persecuted .


When Ham showed disrespect for his father after the Flood , Noah said : “ Blessed be Jehovah , Shem’s God , and let [ Ham’s son ] Canaan become a slave to him . ”
God also stated : “ I am Jehovah , and there is no one else .
The stone mentions Israel’s King Omri and gives Moabite King Mesha’s version of his revolt against Israel .
What is the Septuagint , and how did it come about ?

In Biblical Hebrew , the term often translated “ truth ” pertains to something that is true , trustworthy , faithful , or factual .
The Greek word rendered “ truth ” denotes that which conforms to fact or to what is proper and right .
In part , these include facts about Jehovah’s name , his sovereignty , Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice , the resurrection , and the Kingdom .
19 , 20 .
Who was Nimrod , and what endeavor failed in his day ?
As an opposer of Jehovah God , Nimrod in effect worshipped Satan and was like those opposers to whom Jesus said : “ You are from your father the Devil , and you wish to do the desires of your father .
Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens , and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves , for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth . ”
If Satan had thus planned to start one religion with everyone worshipping him , his plot was an utter failure .
Throughout human history , the worship of Jehovah has prevailed and is gaining momentum with each passing day .
21 , 22 . ( a ) Why has false religion never posed a serious threat to true worship ?
Worshipping God in accord with the truth brings us joy , but doing so requires that we remain spiritually vigilant , relying fully on Jehovah and following the guidance of his holy spirit .

3 , 4 .
When the Jews were taken into captivity in Babylon , it was clear that “ the booth of David ” had fallen .
( Read Psalm 137 : 1 - 6 . )
One Babylonian triad was composed of Sin ( a moon - god ) , Shamash ( a sun - god ) , and Ishtar ( a goddess of fertility and war ) .
Jehovah’s people have been protected from believing such error because they agree with these inspired words : “ Listen , O Israel : Jehovah our God is one Jehovah . ”
Why is it impossible for a person who believes in the Trinity to be baptized in symbol of a valid dedication to God ?
The baptism candidate must also believe that the holy spirit is God’s active force , not part of a Trinity .
An individual who continues to believe in the Trinity cannot be baptized in symbol of a valid dedication to Jehovah God .
Spiritism has been practiced not only by the Babylonians but also by supporters of Babylon the Great , the world empire of false religion .
It is defined rather by dominant idolatries than by geographical or temporal boundaries . ”
338 ) Riddled with spiritism , idolatry , and other sins , Babylon the Great still exists ​ — but not for long . ​ — Read Revelation 18 : 1 - 5 .
What warnings have we published regarding spiritism ?
They have eagerly availed themselves of this mode of concealing their identity , and have thus perpetuated their sway over the minds and lives of many . ”
“ All those . . . who have come to know the truth ” can answer that question .
How were the Jews affected by Hellenic culture and religion ?
The Jews were in a position to know the truth about the dead .

( Read Hebrews 11 : 17 - 19 . )
First - century Jews and Gentiles needed to repent of their sins and to exercise faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
The situation is the same today .
17 , 18 .
We benefit from balanced consideration of the history of Jehovah’s organization , even as the people of Israel benefited from reflecting on how God delivered them from Egyptian bondage .
As an old man who could testify to God’s wonderful acts , Moses urged the Israelites : “ Remember the days of old , consider the years back from generation to generation ; ask your father , and he can tell you ; your old men , and they can say it to you . ”
Since we enjoy spiritual light , what should we do ?
We are grateful that we do not wander in darkness but enjoy spiritual light from God .
Indeed , we proclaim the undeniable truth that Jehovah is the Universal Sovereign , worthy of our wholehearted devotion .
What is symbolized by the splitting of “ the mountain of the olive trees ” ?
What does the “ very great valley ” represent , and how can we stay there ?
Actors portraying news announcers described the landing of an invasion force from Mars that would cause widespread destruction on Earth .
Some even took certain measures in an attempt to protect themselves from imaginary aliens .
This war is foretold , not in a science fiction novel , but in God’s inspired Word , the Bible .
It is the war of Armageddon ​ — God’s war against this wicked system of things .
Still , they will be awestruck by astonishing events and by the fear - inspiring display of God’s power .
What prophecy will we consider , and why is it of interest to us ?
A Bible prophecy recorded in Zechariah chapter 14 has a direct bearing on the war of Armageddon .
Much of what is stated there relates both to situations affecting God’s people since the Messianic Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 and to exciting events that will unfold in the very near future .
What is this day ?
It is represented on earth by its ‘ citizens , ’ the remnant of anointed Christians .
The attackers plundered the wealth of influence that the remnant exercised by banning their literature and restricting their activities as Kingdom proclaimers .
There were “ the remaining ones of the people , ” that is , the anointed remnant who loyally refused to be “ cut off from the city . ”
The course of Jehovah’s anointed Witnesses sets what example for all true worshippers today ?
World War II is a proof of that .
Where , though , will Jehovah’s people find safety in a world that hates them ? ​ — John 15 : 17 - 19 .
In what sense does “ the Mount of Olives ” split ?
Jehovah’s powerful arm will prove to be with his people . ​ — Deut .
11 : 2 .
If we stick to Jehovah and stand firm in the truth , he and his Son , Jesus Christ , will do their part , and God will not allow anyone or anything to ‘ snatch us out of His hand . ’
Food may run short . Property may be lost .
Standards of living may drop .
If such hardships befall us , how will we react ?
( b ) What do “ the eastern sea ” and “ the western sea ” represent ?
These “ living waters ” are Jehovah’s provisions for life .
“ The eastern sea ” refers to the Dead Sea , and “ the western sea ” to the Mediterranean Sea .
Both are used with reference to people . The Dead Sea would well represent those who are in the common grave of all mankind .
( Read Zechariah 14 : 8 , 9 ; Rev .
22 : 1 , 2 .
Under Jehovah’s protection , we will survive the end of this wicked system of things and enter into God’s righteous new world .
Though we are objects of hatred by all the nations , let us be resolved to remain loyal subjects of God’s Kingdom , ever determined to stay in Jehovah’s valley of protection .
In what sense can our endurance mean glory for others ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What is the significance of the original - language words for “ glory ” ?
The radiant splendor of creation ?
Such ones are honored with a good name with Jehovah , and they are likely to be well spoken of by other servants of God . ​ — Prov .
37 : 29 .
8 , 9 .
How human glory can obscure divine glory can be illustrated by comparing glory to light .
“ The glory of the stars ” is awe - inspiring .
To witness the wonders of the night sky , we must somehow block out or avoid the interference from artificial light .
Similarly , if the wrong kind of glory were too close to our hearts , it could prevent us from appreciating and seeking the enduring glory that Jehovah is willing to bestow .
But could the desire to receive glory from humans affect even dedicated servants of God ?
Will he shrink back in fear ?
Or perhaps a Christian has committed a serious sin .
( a ) How may excessive concern about how others view us cloud our judgment ?
What should be our inner response to commendation , and why ?
What prevented certain Jews from listening to Jesus ?
Jesus told certain Jews that they did not listen to his message because ‘ they wished to do the desires of their father the Devil . ’
Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity and demonstrated that discipleship is worth any sacrifice .
Acts 14 : 19 , 20 reports : “ Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the crowds , and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city [ of Lystra ] , imagining he was dead .
3 : 10 , 11 ; Acts 13 : 50 ; 14 : 5 , 19 .
When Paul visited Lystra , he found Timothy to be an exemplary Christian , “ well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium . ”
1 : 3 .
Should we not , then , continue “ seeking the glory that is from the only God ” ? By all means !
( Read Romans 2 : 6 , 7 . )
Among the prisoners is the apostle Paul .
“ For as you have been giving a thorough witness on the things about me in Jerusalem , so you must also bear witness in Rome . ” ​ — Acts 23 : 10 , 11 .
After a perilous journey of several months , he has finally brought his prisoners to their intended destination . ​ — Acts 27 : 1 - 3 , 43 , 44 .
Paul has already seen brothers from Rome who ‘ came to meet him at the Marketplace of Appius and Three Taverns . ’
If that is so , Paul was likely taken to the Praetorian Prefect Afranius Burrus , perhaps second in power only to the emperor .

While imprisoned , Paul gives personal attention to a runaway slave , Onesimus , ‘ to whom he became a father while in prison bonds , ’ and sends him back to his master .
Paul no doubt also takes a personal interest in his guardians .
We can just imagine him questioning a soldier on the purpose of various pieces of armor and then using the information in a fine illustration . ​ — Eph .
Agrippina groomed her young son , Nero , for the role of emperor under the direction of two tutors .
The other was the philosopher Seneca , who developed Nero’s intellect . At the opportune time , Agrippina had her husband poisoned .
See the box entitled “ The Praetorian Guard in Nero’s Day . ”
And we may not realize what has happened until after we have acted unwisely .
The voice of our conscience can prevent us from justifying a wrong course .
What should each of us do ?
God cannot be deceived .
If we openly express our concerns , feelings , and desires in prayer , Jehovah can help us to discern the intentions of our heart .
Our being attentive to what is presented at Christian meetings can help us to take an honest look at our inner person ​ — our heart .

The desire to satisfy our physical needs is natural .
Should we not do our best now to be rich toward God ?
“ Do not come to be among heavy drinkers of wine , ” states Proverbs 23 : 20 .
Just as a small amount of pollution can contaminate clean water , friendship with those who do not practice godly devotion can contaminate our spirituality and lead us into adopting worldly viewpoints , dress , speech , and conduct .
But let us take to heart Paul’s counsel and not allow uncleanness to enter our eyes or ears .
If we have fallen victim to the leanings of a treacherous heart and have become accustomed to justifying wrong behavior , we can make changes .
He states : “ My wife , son , and I are from a country where obtaining the latest and the best in technology and comfort is considered very important .
We have come to see that we do not need much materially in order to have a full and happy life . ”
I knew that there would be excessive drinking at those meetings , but attending them was exciting to me .
Now I handle my business by telephone as much as possible and keep my contact with suppliers to a minimum . ”
We need to be honest with ourselves and identify the intentions of our heart .
God has also provided his Word , which can serve as a mirror for us .
With such provisions , we can guard our heart and keep walking in the pathways of righteousness .
At times , an archaeological discovery directly or indirectly confirms the existence of a Bible character .
It is a 2,000 - year - old burial ossuary ​ — a decorated limestone chest into which the bones of a deceased person were placed after the flesh had decomposed .
Historian Flavius Josephus refers to him as “ Joseph , who was called Caiaphas . ”
According to information provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority ( IAA ) , Miriam’s ossuary was seized from thieves who had plundered an ancient tomb .
There are two possible interpretations of this part of the inscription .
In any case , Miriam’s ossuary provides evidence that the Bible speaks of real people who belonged to real families .
Regarding the ossuary of Caiaphas , see the article entitled “ The High Priest Who Condemned Jesus , ” in The Watchtower of January 15 , 2006 , pages 10 - 13 .
It came just in time and made an indelible impression on the mind of those who saw it .
It was an eight - hour photographic slide and motion picture production , complete with color and sound .
These were put together with some old “ Photo - Drama ” slides that were still usable .
It presented gripping details about the days of creation , reviewed Biblical and secular history , and pointed out that false religion had failed mankind .
The “ Creation Drama ” was shown in Austria , Germany , Luxemburg , and Switzerland , and to German - speaking audiences elsewhere .
Since she could not find it in the Bible , she stopped attending church and got baptized .
Each time , he silenced them with his answers .
That was a challenging question .
Others , it seems , contended that all the laws were equally important and that it was wrong to give more weight to some than to others .
In reply , Jesus mentioned not one but two commands .
The terms “ heart , ” “ mind , ” “ soul , ” and “ strength ” are not mutually exclusive .
* The meaning is : Love for Jehovah must involve the whole person , all his faculties and resources .
We thereby show that we love the God who made us ​ — and them — ​ in his image . ​ — Genesis 1 : 26 .
All that he requires of us can be summed up in a single word : love .
That has always been ​ — and will always be — ​ the essence of true worship .
Have you ever told a lie ? — * Even some grown - ups who love God have lied .
His name is Peter , one of Jesus ’ 12 apostles .
After Jesus is arrested , he is taken to the home of the high priest .
Peter gets into the courtyard of the priest’s home without being recognized .
In the light of a fire , the high priest’s servant girl who let Peter in recognizes him .
Peter is scared .
So for the third time , he lies , saying : “ I do not know the man ! ”
Jesus looks at Peter , and Peter remembers that a few hours earlier , Jesus told him : “ Before a cock crows , you will disown me three times . ”
Peter was not prepared .
Yet , he was very sorry about what he had done , and God forgave him .
He keeps some money for himself !
At that , Ananias falls down dead !
Yes , we all need to learn it !

▪ For Those Loving Jehovah , “ There Is No Stumbling Block ”

The book of Jeremiah has much to tell us about the heart .
What steps are involved in coming to know God and being known by him ?
▪ Honor Jehovah’s Great Name
And how does God view those who disrespect his name ?
29 Did Josephus Really Write It ?
There are also thousands of lakes , especially in central and eastern Finland .

How are Christians in a race , and what is the prize ?
What stones could stumble a Christian ?
In what sense is there no stumbling block for those loving Jehovah’s law ?
How can the attitude of a certain runner illustrate our determination not to give up ?
Our focus must be on running to win . Our race is not a sprint in which speed is the key to victory .
9 : 24 .
What makes our race to gain everlasting life challenging ?
It takes discipline and certainty of purpose .
We may even fall ; but we get up and continue running .
Some have fallen so hard that they had to be helped to get up and resume the race toward the finish line .
( b ) Why do some not recover after stumbling ?
These Bible expressions can , but do not always , have the same sense .
Jehovah will not allow those trusting in him to stumble or to experience a fall ​ — an adversity or a setback in their worship — ​ from which they cannot recover .
We are assured that Jehovah will help us “ get up ” so that we can continue giving him our utmost devotion .
How comforting that is for all who love Jehovah deeply from the heart !
Some lapse into minor sin ​ — even repeatedly — ​ because of some weakness .
We can see that from the way God dealt with ancient Israel .
Proverbs 24 : 16 , quoted earlier , rather than emphasizing the negative ​ — our ‘ falling ’ — ​ focuses on the positive , our ‘ getting up ’ with the help of our merciful God .
( Read Isaiah 55 : 7 . )
Expressing their confidence in us , Jehovah God and Jesus Christ kindly encourage us to “ get up . ” ​ — Ps .
For example , he publicly denied his Master , not just once , but three times .
The apostle Paul , however , saw the matter clearly ​ — there was no room for class distinctions in the congregation .
This too can loom as a stumbling block .
It may interfere with our spiritual pace and even cause us to stagger and tire out . For example , a Japanese sister suffered a health crisis 17 years after her baptism .
Our sister is now back in the race .
Would that not include immoral thinking and actions that have caused some to drop out of the race ? ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 29 , 30 .
( b ) To avoid stumbling , on what do we need to be focused ?
He responded well and soon was back in the race , active in congregation matters again .
Thus , we should not allow the actions or decisions of any fellow Christian to become stumbling blocks to us .
How can we withstand trials or troubling situations ?
Sadly , over the years some have let the imperfections of others knock them out of the race .
Differences in viewpoints in matters of conscience have become stumbling blocks for them .
The Bible admonishes Christians to stop judging , to forgive others , and to avoid insisting on personal rights .
Love for Jehovah can help us be resolved not to allow anything another human does hinder us from crossing the finish line .
20 , 21 .
What are you determined to do in the race for life ?
Remember , no runner is doomed to fail in the race for life just because he stumbles or falls on occasion .
It is not like getting on a bus that simply carries those on board to victory . We must run the race for life ourselves .
As we do , “ abundant peace ” from Jehovah will be like wind at our back .
How were many Jews in Jeremiah’s day “ uncircumcised in heart ” ?
How can we have “ a heart to know ” Jehovah ?
Why might some be interested in figs ?
God gave a vision about what the future held , illustrating it with two types of figs ​ — “ very good ” figs and “ very bad ” ones .
But what of Ezekiel , Daniel and his three companions already in Babylon , and some Jews soon to be taken there ?
Jehovah said of those represented by the good figs : “ I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Jehovah ; and they must become my people . ”
You may already have taken those steps , or you may be regularly associating with Jehovah’s Witnesses and be in the process of doing so .
About whose heart did Jeremiah principally write ?
God is outstandingly qualified , as we see from his words : “ The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . Who can know it ?
Rather , Jehovah was speaking of the figurative heart .
That “ heart ” refers to a person’s entire inner self , encompassing his desires , thoughts , disposition , attitudes , and goals .
To prepare for this examination , we might ask , ‘ What was the condition of the figurative heart of most Jews in Jeremiah’s time ? ’
God told them : “ Get yourselves circumcised to Jehovah , and take away the foreskins of your hearts . ” ​ — Jer .
To ‘ take away the foreskin of their heart ’ meant getting rid of what made their heart unresponsive ​ — their thinking , affections , or motives that were in conflict with God’s . ​ — Acts 7 : 51 .
It is not that many Christians in the congregations are walking in badness or becoming “ bad figs , ” as were many Jews back then .
17 : 3 ; 139 : 23 , 24 .
Jehovah wants each of us to come into and remain in a condition acceptable to him .
13 , 14 .
5 : 21 , 22 .
However , might they harbor strong negative feelings toward a brother or a sister who slighted one of their relatives or who they think did so ?
You would not be the first to experience such .
Jeremiah wrote that unfaithful Jews in his day had “ a stubborn and rebellious heart . ”
Does that not suggest that an aid in taking away ‘ the foreskin of the heart ’ is that of developing a greater fear of and appreciation for Jehovah ?
And we can work with Jehovah as he gives us “ a heart to know ” him .
And I will become their God , and they themselves will become my people . ”
Whether you look forward to benefiting forever from that new covenant in heaven or on earth , you should want to know Jehovah and to be part of his people .
A prerequisite to receiving such benefits is having your sins forgiven on the basis of Christ’s ransom .
You will be like those of whom Jehovah said through Jeremiah : “ You will actually seek me and find me , for you will search for me with all your heart .
Why should a mature Christian continue to grow spiritually ?
It is the very experienced pilot !
Like a safety - minded pilot , you can use a type of checklist to make sure that your faith will not falter when you need it most .
Whether you are newly baptized or you have been serving God for many years , regularly checking the depth of your faith and devotion to Jehovah God is essential .
By means of his sacrifice , Jesus had opened the way for those exercising faith in him to come to know God in a most extraordinary way ​ — they could become sons of God !
Jews and Gentiles alike needed to make spiritual progress .
This involved recognizing that they could not establish their righteousness through the Mosaic Law arrangement .
Regularly reminding ourselves of these nine steps will strengthen us to resist turning back to the things of the world .
But we should continue to grow in both respects .
Growth involves a progressive series of changes .
Thus , after baptism , we need to continue to develop our spirituality so that our growth does not become stunted .
Year after year , the trunk widens and the roots go deeper and spread farther , producing a more stable tree .
The same can be said of a Christian’s spiritual growth .
In the following years , our continued spiritual growth may not be as noticeable .
Thus , we progress , as it were , from a tiny sprout to a mature Christian , a sturdy and well - developed tree .
Why is growth necessary even for mature Christians ?
Thus we become ever more anchored in the soil of God’s Word .
As you can appreciate , this intimacy with Jehovah does not develop overnight .
Jehovah’s “ ears are toward their supplication . ”

The pressures of this system are too great to resist and overcome by ourselves .
16 : 19 .
Jehovah is pleased with all those “ seeking refuge in him ” ; hence , even after our coming to know God , we want to continue regularly associating with the congregation of others who know him .
What are the benefits ?
You will find in the congregation individuals who will incite you “ to love and fine works . ”
Our initially becoming a Christian depended on repentance and on turning around , or turning away from our sins .
Jesus and his Father take note of both our faith and our ministry .
The most precious possession we have is our personal relationship with Jehovah .
Prayerfully examine the quality and the depth of your relationship with him .
You will feel relief as he replaces grief with joy , anguish with peace .
Having “ come to know God , ” what do you want to do now ?

We regularly call on Jehovah in prayer . ​ — Acts 2 : 21
10 : 24 , 25

We turn around , rejecting bad practices . ​ — Acts 3 : 19
Our faith moves us to speak publicly to others . ​ — 2 Cor .
3 : 21
“ O Jehovah , you yourself have proved to be a real dwelling for us during generation after generation . ” ​ — PS .
What can we learn from Abraham’s faithful course ?
Nevertheless , God’s people are not without a “ home . ”
In fact , we enjoy the protection of the most secure and loving home imaginable , one that is discerned through eyes of faith .
Consider , for instance , his dealings with faithful patriarchs , beginning with Abraham .
If Abraham felt any anxiety , it no doubt melted away with Jehovah’s next words : “ I shall make a great nation out of you and I shall bless you and I will make your name great . . . And I will bless those who bless you , and him that calls down evil upon you I shall curse . ” ​ — Gen .
For example , he prevented Pharaoh of Egypt and King Abimelech of Gerar from violating Sarah and doing away with Abraham .
He protected Isaac and Rebekah in a similar manner .
What did Isaac tell Jacob to do , and how may Jacob have felt ?
Those prophets included Abraham’s grandson Jacob . When the time came for Jacob to take a wife for himself , Isaac , his father , said to him : “ You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan .
If Jacob had such anxieties , these no doubt melted away when he reached Luz , some 60 miles ( 100 km ) from Beer - sheba .
8 , 9 .
Deeply appreciative , Jacob prayed : “ I am unworthy of all the loving - kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have exercised toward your servant , for with but my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps . ” ​ — Gen .
32 : 10 .
Indeed , you would have good reason for requesting protection .
This scenario illustrates the situation of Jehovah’s servants , who boldly testify for Jehovah and fearlessly expose his vicious archenemy , Satan !
No !
God’s angels support and protect his servants What lesson can we learn from the patriarchs ?
Once again , let us learn a lesson from the patriarchs .
Although they lived in the land of Canaan , they remained separate from the people of the land , whose wicked , immoral ways they hated .
What they knew about Jehovah and his personality was sufficient for them .
It reflects his cold , self - serving spirit . ​ — 2 Cor .
4 : 4 ; Eph .

What important lesson can we draw from Hebrews 11 : 13 ?
But with God’s help and with support from your fellow Christians , you can succeed .
Does it influence your outlook on life , your view of the present world , and your priorities ? ​ — Read 2 Peter 3 : 11 , 12 .
Infrastructures will collapse , and people will fear for their very lives .
Out of sheer desperation , they will , as it were , seek refuge “ in the caves and in the rock - masses of the mountains . ”
We will have to wait and see .
In what way is Jehovah “ a real dwelling ” even for his loyal servants who have died ?
Long after the faithful patriarchs had died , Jehovah said to Moses : “ I am the God of . . .
What does it mean to know God’s name ?
What does it mean to walk in Jehovah’s name ?
Furthermore , we count it a privilege to understand the meaning of that name and the universal issue involving its sanctification .
That , though , is a privilege that we must never take for granted .
How has Jehovah lived up to his great name , thus adding to its glory ?
What does it mean to know God’s name ?
It includes knowing Jehovah’s reputation , as well as his qualities , purpose , and activities as revealed in the Bible , such as his dealings with his servants .
Jehovah revealed his name to the first human pair ; thus , Eve used it after giving birth to Cain .
Moreover , their appreciation for it grew as Jehovah blessed them , cared for them , and revealed aspects of his purpose to them .
Moses was granted special insight into God’s name .
Moses ’ concern was warranted , for the Israelites had been slaves for some time . They would likely wonder whether the God of their forefathers could deliver them .
Indeed , some Israelites had even taken up the worship of Egyptian gods ! ​ — Ezek .
How did Jehovah reply to Moses ’ question ?
In part , he said : “ This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel , ‘ I SHALL PROVE TO BE has sent me to you . ’ ”
Hence , in verse 15 we read that Jehovah himself said : “ This is my name to time indefinite , and this is the memorial of me to generation after generation . ”
6 , 7 .
Shortly after commissioning Moses , Jehovah fully lived up to his name by ‘ proving to be ’ Israel’s Deliverer .
He humiliated Egypt with ten devastating plagues , at the same time exposing the Egyptian gods ​ — including Pharaoh — ​ as impotent .
He later stated to Isaiah : “ I ​ — I am Jehovah , and besides me there is no savior . ” ​ — Isa .
Hence , near the end of his life , Joshua could with heartfelt conviction say to his fellow Israelites : “ You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed .
Let your kingdom come .
By his dealings with Israel , how did Jehovah continue to add meaning to his name , and with what results ?
He would bless them , keep them , and assign peace to them .
Indeed , throughout Israel’s history , many foreigners were drawn to true worship .
Jehovah’s patience , nevertheless , did have a limit , and that limit was reached when the Jewish nation rejected and killed his Son .
However , God , “ whose name is Jealous , ” clearly would not forever attach it to a people who had disowned him and whom he had disowned .
How did Jehovah produce the foretold name people ?
21 : 43 .
14 , 15 .
Despite the spread of apostasy , what has Jehovah done about his memorial name ?
Why should we view it as an honor to walk in Jehovah’s name ?
Are you making every effort to “ walk in the name of Jehovah ” ?
Do you appreciate what that involves ?
What is involved in walking in God’s name ?
Second , we need to reflect Jehovah’s qualities , especially his love .
Thus , “ Jehovah ” means “ He Causes to Become . ” ​ — Gen . 2 : 4 , ftn .
Evidence points to the conclusion that the same was true of early copies of the Septuagint , a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures .
Many scholars consider this declaration to be authentic .
However , some doubt the genuineness of another statement in the same work concerning Jesus .
Since the end of the 16th century , a heated debate has raged between those who believe that this text is authentic and those who doubt that Josephus wrote it .
He published his research in a book entitled Le Testimonium Flavianum ​ — Examen historique considérations historiographiques ( The Testimonium Flavianum — ​ A Historical Study With Historical Considerations ) .
On analysis , Bardet asserted that this title corresponds “ in every respect to the Greek usage of employing the [ definite ] article for the names of people . ”

So why all the fuss ?
It has convinced one eminent specialist of Hellenistic Judaism and primitive Christianity , Pierre Geoltrain .
He had long considered the Testimonium to be an interpolation , even poking fun at those who believed in its authenticity .
He has concluded that Bardet’s work is the reason for that change .
Geoltrain has now declared that “ nobody should henceforth dare to speak of the ‘ implausible testimony ’ of Josephus . ”
A few experiences from Britain will help you to see why you should never give up hope .
Almost 40 years after first meeting the Witnesses , Georgina saw her husband get baptized
What helped Kyriacos ?
The apostle Peter admonished Christian wives : “ Be in subjection to your own husbands , in order that , if any are not obedient to the word , they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives . ”
One day , a brother with whom John was chatting asked him , “ What about a study ? ”
After she had prayed for 20 years that John might accept the truth , he was baptized .
John notes : “ Two things particularly won me over ​ — the kindness and the friendliness of the Witnesses .
Sometimes the seeds of truth take many years to germinate .
Eventually , Alice stopped her study .
It read : “ I’m sure you will be thrilled to know that your Bible student from 1974 was baptized at the recent district convention .
You planted the seed of truth in me , and although I wasn’t then ready to dedicate myself to God , I kept that seed of truth in my mind and heart . ”
The letter that Stella received from Alice reads : “ I’m sure you will be thrilled to know that your Bible student from 1974 was baptized at the recent district convention ”
Alice explains that she became very depressed after her husband’s death in 1997 .
It may take longer than you expect , but if a person is spiritually hungry , honest , and humble , Jehovah will allow the truth to grow in his or her heart .
Recall the comment in Jesus ’ illustration : “ The seed sprouts and grows tall , just how [ the sower ] does not know .
In principle , each individual Kingdom proclaimer does not know how this may take place .
If you “ persevere in prayer ” and never give up hope , “ in the course of many days , ” you may well find again “ bread ” that you have sent out upon the surface of the waters . ​ — Rom .
When we face such difficulties , how do we cope ?
A friend’s kind , loving words can be like a soothing balm that heals and refreshes us .
They reach out “ to comfort those in any sort of tribulation through the comfort with which [ they themselves ] are being comforted by God . ”
Praying out loud as well as reading the Bible also proved to be of great comfort .
Antonio now recognizes , however , that one of his biggest helps came from his fellow believers .
“ It was not that he did not love Jehovah or the brothers , ” explains Antonio , “ but the illness had affected his emotions to such an extent that he felt useless . ”
One thing that Antonio did to encourage the sick brother was ask him to offer the prayer at a recent gathering .
Though the brother felt inadequate , he accepted the invitation .
Therefore , let us be sensitive to the suffering of fellow Christians and imitate our God , Jehovah , by being a source of comfort to others .

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES ​ — What Is a Bible Study ?
How can she possibly feel that such a life is meaningful ?
So can we if we follow his example .
* Jesus found great joy in doing God’s will .
Our future life prospects as imperfect humans are admittedly grim .
“ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . ” ​ — Matthew 3 : 17 .
Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible .
To learn more about the ransoming value of Jesus ’ death , see chapter 5 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
AS WE discussed in the preceding article , Jesus led a meaningful life .
Walking as Jesus walked involves patterning our entire way of life after his example and teachings .
They have had many sleepless nights , even rushing him to the hospital when he has a diabetic crisis .
For one thing , we enjoy better relationships with those around us .
Can being peaceable toward “ all men ” really add meaning to our life ?
Nair Consider the experience of a woman named Nair .
Over the years , she has faced many pressures that have tested her ability to maintain peace , especially within her own family .
The tent of God is with mankind , and he will reside with them , and they will be his peoples .
The former things have passed away . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
What about you ?
You can read Esa’s story in its entirety in the article , “ The Bible Changes Lives — My Behavior Was Brutal ” .
In addition to giving us the Bible , Jehovah provides us with help to understand it .
If you would like to understand the Bible , Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to help you . ​ — Read Acts 8 : 30 , 31 .
The pungent smell of hot tar was in the air ; the sounds of woodworking tools reverberated .
However , Noah’s God , Jehovah , saw the man in a very different light .
What did that mean ?
Noah grew up in a world that was rapidly going from bad to worse .
Those proud , selfish rebel angels were a poisonous influence among humans . ​ — Genesis 3 : 1 - 5 ; 6 : 1 , 2 ; Jude 6 , 7 .
Jehovah determined that he would wipe out that wicked society within 120 years . ​ — Genesis 6 : 3 - 5 .
Yet , Noah did so .
Little boys tend to be filled with awe and admiration for “ mighty ones ” and “ men of fame ” ​ — and the Nephilim were just that .
They had to help their boys see that Jehovah felt hurt by the violence and rebellion of the world . ​ — Genesis 6 : 6 .
Success is possible !
Noah and his wife succeeded .
Jehovah spoke to this beloved servant and told him of His purpose to bring the world of that time to an end .
Everything that is in the earth will expire . ”
Noah faced a gigantic task .
Evidently , there were windows along the top , as well as a roof that likely peaked in the middle with a slight pitch so that water would run off . ​ — Genesis 6 : 14 - 16 .
The Bible tells us that Noah was “ a preacher of righteousness . ”
Jesus Christ later recalled that time , saying that those people “ took no note . ”
No doubt many ridiculed him and his family ; some may have threatened him and violently opposed him . Despite evidence of God’s blessing on Noah , people ridiculed him and ignored his message
After all , we live in what the Bible calls “ the last days ” of this world system .
In that same year , the patriarch Noah received a new message from Jehovah God : “ Go , you and all your household , into the ark . ”
The account says that “ they went in . . . to Noah inside the ark . ” ​ — Genesis 7 : 9 .
Could he not carry out every event described in Noah’s account ?
Granted , God could have chosen to save his animal creations in some other way .
Noah’s wife and the wives of Shem , Ham , and Japheth may have been especially concerned about making a livable home aboard that ark .
People today take no note of the overwhelming evidence that we are now living in the final days of this world system of things .
When did the ridicule end ?
If any ridiculers were nearby , that divine action no doubt silenced them .
And it kept coming and coming and coming ​ — flooding the world , just as Jehovah had said it would . ​ — Genesis 7 : 16 - 21 .
On the contrary , he had given them every opportunity to change their ways and do right .
Could they have done so ?
And the friendship can last forever !
Lamech did not live to see this prophecy fulfilled .
Wall relief of warriors carrying heads of enemy captives and throwing them in a heap
That request was put to Jesus by one of his disciples .
As part of his response , Jesus related two illustrations that teach us how to pray and be heard by God .
Is Jesus suggesting that when we pray we are , in effect , pounding at the door of a reluctant God ?
By repeatedly asking , we reveal that we really need what we are asking for and that we truly believe that God can grant it ​ — if that is his will . ​ — Mark 11 : 24 ; 1 John 5 : 14 .
Or if he also asks for an egg , will hand him a scorpion ? ”
* ​ — Luke 11 : 11 - 13 ; Matthew 7 : 11 .

One such challenge is how to support yourself financially .
“ The cultural differences were huge , ” says Phillip .
If you would like to serve in isolated regions where help is needed , what can you do now to prepare yourself ?
Brothers and sisters who have experience in this type of service say : Before you move , begin to simplify your lifestyle and learn to be content .
Leticia relates : “ I avoided types of secular work that required me to make a long - term commitment to stay in one place .
Within months , they were able to save the sum they had mentioned in their prayer , and they moved without delay .

What benefits are gained from reading the Bible and applying its teachings ?
As a result , she has drawn closer to her heavenly Father .
What does it mean to read the Bible “ in an undertone ” ?
Jehovah does not want his servants to rush through a reading of his Word .
Because getting the sense of God’s counsel gives you strong motivation to put it into practice .
First , think of a young Christian brother whose personal reading program has taken him to the prophecy of Hosea .
( Read Hosea 4 : 11 - 13 . )
Those verses catch his attention because he has been struggling to resist immoral pressures in school .
She decides to try to eliminate the sarcasm and angry words that she sometimes uses when she speaks to her husband and others .
Third , imagine a Christian father who has lost his job and worries about the well - being of his wife and children .
He senses Jehovah’s loving care and stops worrying overmuch .
Then he reads verse 15 in an undertone .
Work that mine well !
How can we increase our understanding of God’s will ?
Or if you wonder how a certain Bible teaching might affect your life , you could ask a congregation elder or another mature Christian for help .
Apollos was a Jewish Christian who was “ well versed in the Scriptures ” and “ aglow with the spirit . ”
How did this benefit Apollos ?
Like Apollos , we strive to understand what we read in the Bible .
Illustrate how a tactful use of the Scriptures may help Bible students to make progress .
When your encouragement helps an interested person overcome an obstacle to his spiritual progress , how do you feel ?
Or as an elder , how do you feel when a fellow worshipper thanks you for Scriptural counsel that helped him or her through a difficult time ?
( Read 1 Kings 18 : 21 . )
Clearly , the Bible contains many words that can encourage , correct , or strengthen its readers .
By your doing so , you will be in an excellent position to help others spiritually .
( a ) How did “ carefully examining the Scriptures daily ” benefit the Beroeans ?
Jews in the Macedonian city of Beroea had the custom of “ carefully examining the Scriptures daily . ”
Many were convinced that he was teaching the truth , and they “ became believers . ”
Similarly , a Christian’s figurative heart requires shielding from the power of sin .
Such a servant puts on a spiritual breastplate of the highest quality .
( See the box “ Jehovah Gives Me Just What I Need . ” )
Recall that God’s will is that “ all sorts of men should be saved . ”
So are those whom we might help through our preaching and teaching work .
But all who wish to attain to salvation must gain “ an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
Yes , our daily Bible reading shows how highly we esteem Jehovah’s precious Word of truth . ​ — John 17 : 17 .
When does the separating of “ the sheep from the goats ” described at Matthew 25 : 32 take place ? ​ — The Watchtower , October 15 , 1995 , pages 21 - 23 .
A young Christian sister wrote : “ Of all the loving reminders Jehovah gives us , those urging us to read the Bible daily have had the greatest influence on my life .
119 : 128 .
These truths have had the same effect on us today , and they continue to help us to remain “ wise for salvation . ”
He said : “ I should have known .
If you have the privilege of teaching the congregation from the platform , use specific Bible references .
We should encourage the student to read cited texts and help him to grasp their meaning .
Instead of telling him what to believe or how to act , we can ask well - thought - out questions that will help him arrive at proper conclusions .
For example , the Jewish religious leaders complained that Jesus was kind to “ tax collectors and sinners . ”
Jesus responded : “ Persons in health do not need a physician , but the ailing do .
Jesus ’ example teaches us how we should help others .
First , you should find out the facts .
In the days following , you can spend extra time with her .
What principles should parents apply when disciplining their children ?
“ Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful , ” and those who have the responsibility for disciplining young ones should strive to show the same loving qualities . ​ — Jas .
( Read Psalm 119 : 97 - 104 . )
By studying it , he gained wisdom , insight , and understanding .
For him , studying the Scriptures was pleasant and satisfying .
In his teaching , Jesus often asked others : “ What do you think ? ”
Then he waited for a response . ​ — Matt .
“ Make sure of the more important things . ” ​ — PHIL .
Millions have joined together to fill the earth with the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom .
( Read Luke 21 : 34 . )
Others are tiring out because of the pressures and anxieties of everyday life .
In the article that follows , we will consider what can help us to endure and to remain in step with Jehovah’s organization .
5 , 6 . ( a ) Why did Jehovah provide visions of the heavenly part of his organization ?
( b ) What did Ezekiel see in vision ?
Rather , Jehovah provided information that we need in order to understand his purposes and to live our lives in harmony with them .
There is much more going on in support of Jehovah’s purposes than what we can see .
He saw Jehovah in full control of his organization , directing its movement through his holy spirit .
Daniel too saw much to give us confidence .
He was allowed to see Jehovah depicted as “ the Ancient of Days ” sitting on a throne with flames of fire .
Jehovah wanted Daniel to see that His organization is in motion , accomplishing His purpose .
He gave “ rulership and dignity and kingdom ” to his tried and proven Son , Jesus .
Jehovah puts trust in his Son .
When the opportunity arose for him to tell others about what Jehovah is doing , he seized it without hesitation .
Isaiah was confident that with Jehovah’s backing , he could successfully face any challenge .
How do we demonstrate our support for the arrangements made by Jehovah’s organization ?
One important way is by always putting our confidence in the ones whom Jehovah and Jesus are trusting to lead us in our preaching work .
There are many activities or causes in the world today that could vie for the attention of those taking the lead among us .
They rejoice greatly at the progress that is being made in the preaching of the good news locally and throughout the world .
( Read Acts 15 : 28 . )
Thousands of volunteers work tirelessly to translate this spiritual food into some 600 languages so that as many as possible can learn about “ the magnificent things of God ” in their own language .
To facilitate the preaching of the good news , to enhance the spiritual welfare of those carrying out this work , and to advance true worship .
What would be a good Bible study project for you or your family ?
6 : 9 .
IT IS awe - inspiring to contemplate that we are part of a vast universal organization .
Jesus is taking the lead in directing the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization to focus on preaching the good news , to care spiritually for those carrying out this work , and to promote the true worship of Jehovah .
What is needed in order for us not to tire out , and what will we consider in this article ?
Thus , action is needed on our part .
We need to keep on “ encouraging one another , and all the more so as [ we ] behold [ Jehovah’s ] day drawing near . ” ​ — Heb .
How can we encourage one another at our meetings ?
Congregations
We are strengthened and made firm in the faith by the Scriptural discussions .
The Teaching Committee of the Governing Body oversees the preparation of all spiritual programs for the instruction of Jehovah’s people earth wide .
7 , 8 . ( a ) What is the primary purpose of our congregation meetings ?
There is something even more important , however , than the personal benefits we receive from our meetings .
It is no wonder , then , that we are exhorted ‘ not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together , as some have the custom ’ ! ​ — Heb .
10 : 25 .
It would have to be something extremely significant to cause us to miss an opportunity to be united with our brothers in worship of Jehovah .

No doubt , you can think of a time when after reading a publication , you thought : ‘ That is exactly what I needed !
He has said : “ I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go . ”
What can help us not to take our spiritual provisions for granted ?
Do we encourage our children to respect these faithful men and to look to them for Scriptural advice ?
Additionally , do we discuss as a family how we can use our finances to support the worldwide work through our donations ?
40 : 29 - 31 .
Because of our imperfect flesh and the efforts of Satan and this wicked world , we are constantly battling negative influences in our lives .
Do not give up !
Living our lives in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose will give us great satisfaction and ensure that our worship is not futile . ​ — 1 Cor .
9 : 24 - 27 .
Keeping the matter hidden will only make matters worse .

Anne realized that she needed help and went to the elders for assistance .
Our sister Saimi was baptized that same year .
We also studied the Bible with our sister Linnea , who was already married .
That helped us to see that serving Jehovah full - time is not dependent solely on our own resources or the support of our family .
After 50 years of pioneer service , we still have our savings left !
She learned the truth in an interesting way .
Later , a man who had studied the Bible with the Witnesses came to work at the sawmill . He and his family started to associate with our group .
Still , our boots were often full of snow .
We had walked over seven miles ( 11 km ) to that house .
Lapland is a barren but beautiful country , and its beauty varies according to the season .

We got further help when a new Kingdom Hall was built and we moved into an apartment attached to it .
The growth we have witnessed brings us great joy .
In some cases , we had been conducting a Bible study in his home when he was a child .
How unnecessary our initial hesitation proved to be !
JESUS stated that not a stone of Jehovah’s temple would be left standing upon a stone ​ — a prophecy that was fulfilled when the Roman army under Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70 C.E .
Julian loathed Christianity .
Julian , according to church historians , encouraged the Jews to rebuild their temple , in the belief that this would prove that Jesus was a false prophet .

A young nun made sexual advances toward me .
I decided to study music at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City .
I provided for the family by singing Mass in the Catholic Church .
Finally , after 13 years , we decided to separate and later to divorce .
I thought that I knew a lot about religion , so I set out to prove them wrong .
However , my wife was very rude to the Witnesses , and I was very busy , so the visits ended .
Five years later , I was living with another woman , Elvira , when I once again came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Elvira didn’t oppose the Witnesses , so I found it easier to study the Bible on a regular basis .
Even so , it took me several years to break free from my past .
I realized that if I wanted to worship Jehovah wholeheartedly , I needed to make some big changes .
First I had to quit my job singing Mass in the Catholic Church , which meant that I had to find another means of making a living .
The Bible taught me that if I want Jehovah to hear my prayers , I must treat my wife with honor
I now enjoy a happy family life .
I support my family by teaching music .
MARGARET , * A STEPMOTHER IN AUSTRALIA : “ My husband’s ex - wife told the children not to listen to anything I said ​ — even something as simple as ‘ Remember to brush your teeth . ’ ”
Stepfamilies face unique and often challenging relationships with those outside their household .
Consider how advice from the Bible can help your stepfamily to meet those challenges .
If you try to shut out the other parent altogether , your child might suffer emotionally .
If you do not have custody of your children , perhaps you can use phone calls , letters , text messages , or e - mail to maintain regular contact .
Ask for her advice , and thank her when she offers it .
If this is not possible , explain the differences without demeaning the other parent .
Consider the following scenario :
Would this response be better ?
Make eye contact and smile .
For example , say , “ Hello , Jane . ”
Include the person in the conversation if you are in a group .
How can you keep relationships with the adult children from damaging your marriage ?
So try to set reasonable , realistic expectations when it comes to closeness with your stepchildren .
If you decide to live in the house that the children were raised in , you may be surprised at the attachment they still feel toward it .
Instead , simply try to build mutual understanding between the two of you .
While you cannot expect instant love for new family members from all relatives and friends , you can ask them to be polite and fair .
A mother in England named Susan relates : “ I remarried 18 months after my first husband died , and his parents struggled to accept my new husband .
Things got better when we included them more , had the kids call them , and thanked them for their support . ”
TRY THIS : Identify the friend or relative with whom you have the most difficult relationship , and then discuss with your mate how you can improve that relationship .
Apply Scriptural counsel , though , and your family can receive the blessing the Bible promises : “ By wisdom a household will be built up , and by discernment it will prove firmly established . ” ​ — Proverbs 24 : 3 .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
If so , you may wonder , ‘ Does Jehovah really care about his worshippers as individuals ? ’
Jesus explained : “ No man can come to me unless the Father , who sent me , draws him . ”
If we understand what Jesus meant , then we will see in his words powerful evidence of God’s personal care .
Jehovah gently attracts , or tugs at , the heart of an individual who is “ rightly disposed . ”
Jehovah does so in two ways ​ — through the Bible’s message of good news , which reaches us as individuals , and through his holy spirit .
Does knowing that Jehovah cares about his worshippers as individuals move you to want to open the door of your heart ?

▪ Are You “ Zealous for Fine Works ” ?
▪ Parents , Children ​ — Communicate With Love
▪ Safeguard Your Inheritance by Making Wise Choices
Taking what measures will help us to make wise choices regarding our inheritance ?
These questions are answered in this article .
“ Do the work of an evangelizer , fully accomplish your ministry . ” ​ — 2 TIM .
Throughout the centuries , Jehovah inspired faithful men to write down details about how his name will be cleared of reproach , how the damage caused by Satan will be undone , and how humans can regain the opportunities forfeited by Adam and Eve .
Angels too are evangelizers .
What about the archangel Michael ?

Since we are evangelizers , let us consider the answers to two important questions : Why is it vital that people hear the good news today ?
Effective questions help people to discover their own reasons for their beliefs
They are taught that God is a mystery , that he is unknowable , or that he is cruel .
How have the theory of evolution and false doctrines affected people ?
In this regard , consider the theory of evolution .
Some have even said that a human is just another animal , so it should come as no surprise when a person acts in an animalistic fashion .
Therefore , those who put faith in evolution are robbed of true hope .
Instead , as the apostle Paul notes , they have left people “ in darkness mentally , and alienated from the life that belongs to God . ”
To become reconciled to God , people must first be convinced that Jehovah exists and that there are good reasons for drawing close to him .
When people study creation with an open mind , they learn of God’s wisdom and power .
You might believe him .
Jesus knew that well - chosen questions not only help a teacher learn about a student but also get the listener involved in the discussion .
By using questions and making statements , Jesus did more than impart facts . He touched hearts , motivating people to act in harmony with the good news .
Consider three scenarios showing how we can use questions to good effect .
Give an example .
How could you do so ?
After reading with your child portions from the brochure The Origin of Life ​ — Five Questions Worth Asking , you could ask what arguments he finds most thought provoking .
The classmate will likely answer yes .
We could then offer him either the brochure Was Life Created ?
Scenario 3 : When conducting a Bible study , we might simply have the student repeat answers printed in a Bible study aid .
To help avoid that outcome , we need to ask our student how he feels about what he is learning .
If we use questions effectively , individuals we teach are more likely to be solidly rooted in the faith and to be able to resist the efforts of those who would oppose or mislead them .
Later , the apostle Paul mentioned “ fellow workers ” who had “ striven side by side with [ him ] in the good news . ”
What do we do well to remember , and why ?
Jehovah has shown us extraordinary kindness by entrusting us with the treasure of the ministry of the good news .
( Read 2 Corinthians 4 : 1 , 7 . )
So let all of us show appreciation for that treasure by doing our best to fulfill our role as evangelizers .
Why do you consider it an honor to be zealous for fine works ?
For instance , some have received the Nobel Prize for acting zealously to establish peace between hostile or alienated parties .
3 : 9 .
Upon being told to cut the tree down , the vinedresser requested time to fertilize it .
But as indicated in that illustration of the vinedresser , Jesus used the short time remaining ​ — about six months — ​ to intensify his preaching activity in Judea and Perea .
In view of how deep we are in the time of the end , is it not vital to intensify our preaching efforts ?
We are the only people on earth who offer hope of real solutions to mankind’s problems .
It is our Christian duty and privilege to share the Bible’s answers to such questions with all those willing to listen .
With God’s blessing , our zealous evangelizing can help others come to know and love Jehovah .
What about our hardworking elders who miss meals or lose sleep to care for Jehovah’s sheep ?
Our hearts swell with appreciation when we think of all these self - sacrificing servants of God .
What do these church ministers do all day ? They certainly do not go out like Christ did and meet the people . . .
12 : 1 .
( Read Romans 10 : 13 - 15 . )
The second element of zealous works that attracts people to God is fine Christian conduct .
In fact , we often hear of positive results when sincere people observe our Christlike conduct .
To illustrate : Some years ago , there was an attempt to eliminate Jehovah’s Witnesses in an area of Angola .
We may wonder how many were reconciled to God because of the courageous stand taken by Peter and the other apostles .
In our case , fellow students , workmates , or members of our family may respond favorably when they see the stand we take for what is right .
In Eritrea , 55 servants of Jehovah are imprisoned , some over 60 years of age .
After that , her friend got off the bus .
“ What made you ask ? ”
Indeed , many who claim to be followers of Christ have no inclination to “ give free . ”
For instance , while preaching from door to door on one occasion , a pioneer was quickly dismissed by an elderly widow .
She said that when he rang the doorbell , she was on a stepladder in the kitchen , trying to replace a lightbulb .
When the woman’s son learned about what had happened , he was so impressed that he tried to find the brother in order to express his appreciation .
If we are zealous for fine works , we will be richly rewarded with joy and satisfaction now .
“ I WOULD rather spend time with my wife than with anyone else , ” said a brother in Canada .
A husband in Australia wrote : “ In our 11 years together , not one day has passed when I have not spoken with my wife .
Frequent and meaningful communication is a prime reason for this . ”
What has helped couples to strengthen their marriage ?
The same can be said of many couples today .
“ He that is showing insight in a matter will find good , ” says Proverbs 16 : 20 .
On the other hand , many men are less inclined to discuss their feelings and are more likely to talk about activities , problems , and solutions .
An insightful husband takes note of his wife’s feelings and tries to adapt his approach accordingly .
At the same time , he reassures her that her thoughts and feelings are important to him .
When a husband and wife understand , appreciate , and fulfill their Scriptural roles , their union is a thing of beauty .
6 , 7 . ( a ) In what way can the principle found at Ecclesiastes 3 : 7 help marriage mates to show insight ?
( b ) How can a wife show discernment , and what effort should a husband make ?
An insightful couple also know that there is “ a time to keep quiet and a time to speak . ”
Yet , I have come to realize that it is not a sign of weakness to show my feelings .
Important for both husband and wife are prayer and a strong desire to improve their communication skills .
But when a couple love Jehovah , ask for his spirit , and view their union as sacred , they have the kind of motivation that many lack .
Such loyalty and godly devotion please God and result in his rich blessing . ​ — Ps .
127 : 1 .
Love also impels a couple to continue learning about each other .
Why is respect vital to a successful marriage ?
Illustrate .
Abraham and Sarah did not always agree with each other .
For instance , Abraham said “ please ” to Sarah .
Why should newlyweds work especially hard to cultivate respectful speech ?
Newlyweds should work especially hard to speak kindly and respectfully to each other , thus creating an atmosphere of free and honest communication .
How can pride affect a marriage ?
It is good to remember that “ God opposes the haughty ones , but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones . ” ​ — Jas .
4 : 6 .
“ The result has been some of the worst nights ’ sleep I’ve ever had ! ”
To illustrate : A wife might have special talents that she uses for the benefit of the family .
After all , the two of them are “ one flesh , ” and what hurts one hurts the other . ​ — Matt .
19 : 4 , 5 .
What can help present - day marriages to be happy and a cause for praise to God ?
Look to his Word for insight and wisdom .
Treat your mate with respect .
This is because of our love for Jehovah and our regular communication with each other . ”
“ Every man must be swift about hearing , slow about speaking , slow about wrath . ” ​ — JAS .
1 : 19 .
How do parents and children generally feel about one another , but what difficulty do they sometimes face ?
In some countries , children begin preschool at an early age , sometimes when they are only two years old .
Meaningful conversation may be almost nonexistent .
My giving up the job has meant that we have to manage with less money , but I feel that I am now in touch with my children’s thoughts and problems .
What is a common complaint of both children and parents ?
How might parents truly listen to their children ?
Insight and discernment are especially needed when you are drawing your children out on sensitive topics .
Children , do you obey your parents ?
Of course , you should also try to understand them .
When it comes to listening to advice from young people your own age , you need to be careful .
They may tell you what you want to hear , but their advice may not help you at all .
Remember the example of King Solomon’s son Rehoboam .
Rather than imitating Rehoboam’s unwise course , work hard to keep the lines of communication with your parents open .
If you are willing to listen compassionately to your children on every sort of topic , you will likely find that they will open up to you and welcome your guidance .
A barrier to communication also arises when parents react emotionally and negatively to what their children tell them .
These “ last days ” are fraught with dangers ​ — spiritual and otherwise .
However , what parents see as protective may seem excessive to their children .
Why should parents be careful about expressing their opinion too quickly ?
Parents are wise not to express their opinion too quickly .
As loving parents , use your ears to gain understanding and your tongue to heal .
Why should children be slow about speaking ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 5 . )
What will help us not to lose patience and become upset with our loved ones ?
Consider the example of Jesus .
Imagine the immense stress that he was feeling at the last evening meal he had with his apostles .
The sanctification of his Father’s name and the salvation of the human family depended on his faithfulness .
Instead , he calmly reasoned with them .
What will help children to stay calm ?
By calmly listening to them and being cooperative , you will earn their respect and will establish a reputation as a responsible person .
29 : 11 .
So dear parents and children , do not be discouraged if the communication in your family is not as open as you would like it to be .
Keep working at it , and keep on walking in the truth .
In the new world , perfect people will be able to interact perfectly , without misunderstandings and contention .
Presently , though , all of us do things we later regret .
“ Abhor what is wicked , cling to what is good . ” ​ — ROM .
1 , 2 . ( a ) How did you make your decision to serve God ?
( b ) What questions can we ask about our spiritual inheritance ?
MILLIONS of us have made the wise choice to serve Jehovah God and closely follow the steps of Jesus Christ .
Our choice was based , not on a superficial knowledge of a few scriptures , but on a thorough study of God’s Word .
How should we view it ?
What will help us to make wise choices ?
The other sheep will receive the inheritance that sinful Adam and Eve never received ​ — everlasting life on a paradise earth with no more suffering , death , or mourning .
Even now , we enjoy certain aspects of our inheritance .
No wonder we cherish our inheritance !
To hold fast to our wonderful inheritance , though , we must remain alert to Satan’s ploys .
If we are to keep on ‘ standing firm against the machinations of the Devil , ’ we must continue to value our inheritance highly .
Nearly 4,000 years ago , Esau and his twin brother , Jacob , were born to Isaac and Rebekah .
When Esau and Jacob were 15 years old , their grandfather Abraham died , but Jehovah’s promise to Abraham did not die .
Did he appreciate it ? Do not put your spiritual inheritance in jeopardy
8 , 9 . ( a ) What choice did Esau make concerning his inheritance ?
To make the birthright transaction legal , Jacob insisted : “ Swear to me first of all ! ”
Without hesitation , Esau gave up his birthright .
After that , “ Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew , and he went to eating and drinking .
Have you not reserved a blessing for me ? ”
27 : 30 - 38 .
What aspects of Esau’s disposition stand out in the Scriptures ?
How did God view Esau and Jacob ?
By means of the prophet Malachi , Jehovah said : “ I loved Jacob , and Esau I have hated . ” ​ — Mal .
Indeed it is .
The apostle Paul cautioned fellow believers to be careful that “ there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things , like Esau , who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn . ”
As servants of Jehovah , we certainly do not search for tempting situations that could lead to immoral sexual behavior .
For instance , imagine being in a situation that offered an opportunity to satisfy a particular desire in an immoral way .
How crucial it is to prepare our heart now ​ — well before we find ourselves in situations that test our integrity !
We reinforce our defenses by seeking Jehovah’s wisdom Reflecting on what questions can help us to “ abhor what is wicked ” and “ cling to what is good ” ?
The first step involves reflecting on the consequences of our actions .
After all , if we love someone , we do not want to hurt that person .
Instead , we strive to merit his approval .
Do I really want to end up like Esau , weeping bitterly when I realize what I have done ? ’
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 12 , 19 . )
How can we succeed in acquiring the ability to make wise choices ?
Underscoring that fundamental truth , the Bible states : “ My son , if you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself , so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear , that you may incline your heart to discernment ; if , moreover , you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself , if you keep seeking for it as for silver , and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it , in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah , and you will find the very knowledge of God .
May the enjoyment of friendship with Jehovah and the application of godly wisdom move all of us to keep on making the kind of choices that will gladden Jehovah’s heart and safeguard our inheritance .
Evidently , during the time of the Hebrew Scriptures , a person who deserved to die was first put to death and then hung on a stake or a tree
As told by Patricia Smith
Nevertheless , I continued to read the Bible and to pray to Jehovah .
However , his sight was deteriorating , and he was registered as blind in 1975 .
What a blessing this has been !
My son was very happy when , some time later , our circuit overseer asked him , “ Why don’t you become a regular pioneer , Gary ? ”
Gary has had two hip replacements , the first in 1999 and the second in 2008 , but Louise’s health problems were much more serious .
She was born totally blind , and when I saw an extra toe on one of her feet , I realized that she too had LMBB syndrome .
Alert to the difficulties that can arise when surgery is needed , Louise talks to the surgeons , the anesthesiologists , and the management team beforehand to explain her decisions regarding nonblood medical procedures .
Gary has also encouraged a Christian who was inactive for 25 years .
Both individuals now attend Christian meetings .
The cards are treasured by those who receive them .
In her early teens , Louise learned touch - typing .
Louise was baptized when she was 17 years old .
Like Gary , Louise memorizes scriptures to express faith in God’s promises of a world in which “ the eyes of the blind ones will be opened ” and “ no resident will say : ‘ I am sick . ’ ” ​ — Isa .
Today , it is commonly referred to as Bardet - Biedl syndrome . There is no cure .
Henry Hudson
Within a short time , some 40 Bible Students were held in military prisons , and 8 had been sent to the front in France .
News then came that the eight sent to France had been sentenced to be shot for their refusal to accept military discipline .
In a test case in Manchester , England , the defendant was Henry Hudson , a medical doctor and Bible Student .
The public reacted to the cruel treatment these men received , so the government transferred them from military prison to civilian work camps .
Pryce Hughes Edgar Clay and Pryce Hughes , who later served as branch overseer in Britain , worked on a dam in Wales .
On the other hand , Herbert Senior , one of the eight who had been returned from France , was sent to Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire .
Others served their sentences of hard labor in the harsh conditions of Dartmoor Prison , where they formed the largest single group of conscientious objectors .

Should We Pray to Saints ?
12 Teach Your Children ​ — What Can We Learn From a Criminal ?
Any such hope was shattered when he provided medical assistance to a 25 - year - old woman .
Prejudice is found in every corner of the earth .
Some say it is “ a negative attitude or feeling toward an individual based solely on that individual’s membership in a certain group . ” Others say that this attitude is based on “ insufficient information , ” which leads to the “ prejudgment of members of [ a ] group . ”
They look strong , and one of them appears to have something in his hand .
Do you conclude that the young men pose a threat to you ?
Since all of us are plagued with this human tendency ​ — often with disastrous consequences — ​ is there any hope that we can overcome or eliminate prejudice in our life ?
Using that captivating refrain , King expressed his dream , or hope , that one day people would enjoy life free from racial prejudice .
Even in lands where some progress has been made in combating racial and other forms of prejudice , the question remains : Have the improvements really rooted out the deep - seated feelings of people or have they merely curbed the outward manifestation of those feelings ?
Linda : I was born in South Africa .
I learned that “ God is not partial ” and that the heart is more important than the color of our skin or the language we speak .
“ I came to see how God views people . ” ​ — Michael
Now I find great pleasure in associating with people from all countries and backgrounds .
Sandra : My mother was from Umunede in Delta State , Nigeria .
I adjusted my thinking and made peace with my father’s family .
Applying Bible principles has made me happy and has given me peace of mind .
Furthermore , the Bible shows what else is needed in order to end all prejudice .
The Bible shows that God’s Kingdom will accomplish just that .
* ​ — 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
If so , you are far from alone .
Peter , born a Jew , lived at a time when Jews viewed Gentiles as unclean and thus unacceptable for any kind of fellowship .
Peter had received a divine vision in which he was told : “ You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed . ”
“ For a certainty , ” said Peter , “ I perceive that God is not partial . ”
When Jehovah looks down from heaven , he sees just one race ​ — the human race
If you have ever experienced discrimination or prejudice , there is good reason for you to take heart from Peter’s words about God .
Are you moved to learn more about this impartial God ?
First , although humans have accomplished marvelous things , they are not created with the ability to direct their own steps .
Only a world government that can teach people to love what is right and care for one another will bring world peace . ​ — Read Isaiah 32 : 17 ; 48 : 18 , 22 .
He will eliminate evil from all the earth and will teach people the way of peace . ​ — Read Isaiah 9 : 6 , 7 ; 11 : 4 , 9 .

LIFE STORY
THAT is one of the earliest memories I have of my father , a modest , hardworking man .
I was the eldest child , so I helped to teach my sister and two brothers .
That included something that Father often mentioned ​ — Noah’s love for his family , shown by his obedience to God .
My pioneer partner and I were thrilled to distribute a lot of Bible literature , but being rather young , how I missed home !
Our wedding day I was later assigned to Milan to help with preparations for the 1963 “ Everlasting Good News ” International Assembly .
I was a regular pioneer in Florence for ten years .
Paolo and I enjoyed spending time with them in spiritual conversations as well as in recreation , which for Paolo usually meant playing soccer .
It still brings me joy to think back on the many Bible studies we were able to conduct .
They arranged a meeting with a priest to discuss such church doctrines as the Trinity and the immortal soul .
Three prelates turned up at the meeting .
It became clear that opposers had arranged ahead of time for some in the audience to ask what were considered awkward questions .
However , the conversation took a turn .
After Paolo and I had been married for ten years , we were invited to serve in the circuit work .
We enjoyed spending time with the families who hosted us .
During that time , Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy obtained important legal recognition .
We certainly were happy in this type of service .
Paolo loved his work at Bethel
In the early 1980 ’ s , there was a legal case on this issue that caused quite a stir .
I did my best to support him in his important efforts .
Judging from the result , Jehovah must have answered his prayer ​ — and mine .
But we supported each other , remembering the value of mutual encouragement .
She has never felt neglected ; she grew up in a totally normal family .
We explained from the Bible why she should not behave that way .
Ilaria readily says that she appreciates the love for the ministry that her parents displayed .
At first it seemed that Paolo would be able to survive the illness , and he encouraged me greatly .
I know that our work will have lasting value .
“ Deep down , I’m still that little girl so in love with the story of Noah .
My determination has not changed .
I want to obey Jehovah , no matter what is asked .
( a ) What qualities of Jehovah might a Christian consider ?
In turn , the deeper our appreciation for Jehovah , the stronger our desire to draw close to him and to imitate him . ​ — Josh .
In the case of each , we will consider : What is its meaning ?
Let us first take up the quality of approachableness .
You might say , ‘ Someone who is kind , readily available , and easy to talk to . ’
How does Jehovah demonstrate that he is approachable ?
Although he is the almighty Creator of our vast universe , Jehovah assures us that he is willing and eager to listen to our prayers and to respond to them .
Just imagine !
Jehovah wants us to be as close to him as a little lamb nestled in the bosom of a caring shepherd .
Of course , it is not enough for an elder to say that he is approachable ; he should manifest that quality .
he said to the brother , “ Yes , let it come ​ — we have to talk some more about this . ”
Similarly , Christian elders want to give visible signs that tell their fellow believers : “ Feel free to approach me . ”
Who should take the initiative in this ?
Likewise , elders today take the initiative to approach their fellow believers and speak to them .
How can that affect the congregation ?
Impartiality is another of Jehovah’s endearing qualities .
Hence , one who is impartial will pay due regard , not to an individual’s outward appearance or circumstances , but to his or her character as a person .
A situation that arose in Moses ’ day demonstrates that .
13 , 14 . ( a ) The five daughters of Zelophehad faced what situation ?

What was it ?
However , their father , Zelophehad of the tribe of Manasseh , had died .
By all means you should give them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of their father’s brothers , and you must cause their father’s inheritance to pass to them . ”
( b ) What other Bible accounts illustrate that Jehovah is impartial ?
What a kind and impartial decision that was !
16 : 1 - 13 ; Acts 10 : 30 - 35 , 44 - 48 .
True , all of us like to think of ourselves as being open - minded and impartial .

You could ask some friend whom you can count on for candor whether you have a reputation for being impartial . If he or she concedes that there seem to be some lingering traces of racial , social , or economic partiality , what should you do ?
7 : 7 ; Col .
For instance , when it comes to showing hospitality , we want to invite all sorts of fellow believers , including those whose background differs from ours as well as those who are poor , orphaned , or widowed .
( Read Galatians 2 : 10 ; James 1 : 27 . )
Further , in the Kingdom - preaching work , we share the good news impartially with people of all backgrounds , including those from foreign countries .
“ Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him . ” ​ — Ps .
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity ?
1 , 2 .
“ My husband and I know each other very well .
145 : 9 .
What is the essence of true generosity ?
What does it mean to be generous ?
Really , generosity is measured , not by the size of the gift , but by the motive of the giver .
No one is more generous than our “ happy God , ” Jehovah . ​ — 1 Tim . 1 : 11 .
That is why the apostle Paul , when speaking to unbelievers , could say that Jehovah “ did good , giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , filling your hearts to the full with food and good cheer . ”
Jehovah especially delights in providing for the needs of his faithful worshippers .
Consider an example .
Some years ago , a full - time minister named Nancy found herself in a predicament .
“ I needed $ 66 to pay my rent , which was due the next day , ” Nancy recalls . “ I didn’t know how I was going to come up with the money .
6 : 33 .
What is Jehovah’s most generous gift ?
What is it ?
The Israelites were encouraged to imitate Jehovah’s generosity ( See paragraph 9 )
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity ?
By using our time and energy to help and encourage others .
19 : 17 .
13 , 14 . ( a ) How does Jehovah demonstrate reasonableness ?
After all , Jehovah surely could have kept Lot alive anywhere , so Lot’s fears really had no basis .
He allowed Lot to flee to a city that He had intended to destroy .
In that case , Jehovah allowed the needy Israelite to offer a little flour .
Why is that significant ? ​ — Read Leviticus 5 : 7 , 11 .
Then you remember that in Jehovah’s eyes , your offering is significant .
Why ?
In effect , Jehovah was saying to poorer Israelites : ‘ I realize that you cannot offer as much as others can , but I also know that what you are giving me is your best . ’
103 : 14 .
We can draw comfort from knowing that in his reasonableness , Jehovah accepts our whole - souled service .
If you are a parent , can you imitate Jehovah’s example ?
Along this line , the September 1 , 2007 , issue of The Watchtower mentioned that some parents may bring their children into the discussion of house rules .

Of course , we would never want to confuse being reasonable with holding back from rendering service to God just to be kind to ourselves .
We do not want to take it easy and then defend our attitude by saying that we are being reasonable .
When we give him our best , we can be sure that he is pleased .
86 : 5 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why do we appreciate friends who are loyal and forgiving ?
“ To me , a true friend is someone who is always there for you and who forgives you when you fall short , ” says a Christian sister named Ashley .
All of us appreciate friends who are loyal and forgiving .
They help us to feel secure and loved . ​ — Prov .
It is as the psalmist put it : “ You , O Jehovah , are good and ready to forgive ; and the loving - kindness [ or , “ loyal love ” ] to all those calling upon you is abundant . ”
What does it mean to be loyal ?
( Read 2 Samuel 22 : 26 . )
We can gain strength from reflecting on Jehovah’s acts of loyalty .
I find that very encouraging !
One way is by taking action in behalf of those who are facing difficult circumstances .
In addition , we show loyalty to our fellow believers by shunning hurtful gossip or slander , refusing to spread such negative talk or even to listen to it . ​ — Prov .
12 : 18 .
119 : 104 .
What does it mean to be forgiving ?
Rather , he chooses to let go of resentment .
How does Jehovah demonstrate forgiveness ?
When a sinner genuinely repents , he deeply regrets his wrong course .
That expression comes from a Greek word that means to “ wipe out , erase . ”
He forgives completely . ​ — Heb .
10 : 22 ; 1 John 1 : 7 .
Consider Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning the new covenant , made with anointed Christians , which makes true forgiveness possible for those who exercise faith in the ransom .
Jehovah says : “ I shall forgive their error , and their sin I shall remember no more . ”
Give an example .
However , Elaine drew comfort from reading and meditating on some of the word pictures that the Bible uses to describe Jehovah’s forgiveness .
* Elaine says : “ I realized that I had not believed that Jehovah could fully forgive me , and I thought that I would carry this burden for the rest of my life .
I know that it will take time , but I am starting to feel that I really can draw closer to Jehovah , and I feel that a weight has been lifted off me . ”
What a loving and forgiving God we serve ! ​ — Ps .
We can imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness by choosing to be forgiving toward one another whenever there is a basis for doing so .
It basically means that we choose to let go of resentment .
Significantly , though , in order to be forgiven by God , we must imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness in our dealings with others .
4 : 32 ; Col .
May our prayers for forgiveness be from the heart ( See paragraph 17 )
What was it ?
Job did as Jehovah asked , and Jehovah blessed him for his forgiving spirit .
18 , 19 .
It has certainly been refreshing for us to consider various aspects of Jehovah’s loving personality .
We have seen that he is approachable , impartial , generous , reasonable , loyal , and forgiving .
We agree with the apostle Paul , who wrote : “ O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge ” ​ — not to mention love and the six qualities we have considered . ​ — Rom .
73 : 28 .
in the April 1 , 1995 , issue .
See paragraph 10 in chapter 26 of the book Draw Close to Jehovah .
“ With your counsel you will lead me , and afterward you will take me even to glory . ” ​ — PS .
What circumstances led him to this profound conclusion ?
He lamented : “ It is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself . ”
This experience taught that God - fearing man a vital lesson : Being among God’s people , accepting counsel , and applying it are essential to a close relationship with Jehovah . ​ — Ps .
( See opening image . )
With ancient Israel , Jehovah demonstrated his ability to do what the potter does to clay .
Does Jehovah arbitrarily mold people or nations , making some good and others bad ?
How , then , does he exercise his divine authority ?
We can see how he exercises authority over those whom he molds by considering Israel’s first two kings ​ — Saul and David .
When counseled , Saul should have let his heart be softened , allowing himself to be shaped by the Great Potter .
Instead , Saul refused to be molded .
He refused to be molded !
Jehovah also gave the people of the Assyrian capital of Nineveh an opportunity to respond to his warning .
His word occurred to Jonah , saying : “ Get up , go to Nineveh the great city , and proclaim against her that their badness has come up before me . ”
Nineveh was deemed fit for destruction . ​ — Jonah 1 : 1 , 2 ; 3 : 1 - 4 .
12 , 13 . ( a ) Why does God alter his course when individuals respond to his molding ?
That is evident in situations where Jehovah determines to take action based on his just judgment of people but then changes his mind because of their response .
The Hebrew term translated “ felt regret ” actually pertains to a change of attitude or intention .
The true God felt regret in the case of the Ninevites ; that is , he changed his intention regarding them .
Consider the example of Dennis * who was serving as an elder .
“ Over the past 30 years , I had had many privileges .
Suddenly , it was all gone .
He explains : “ I was determined to maintain a good spiritual routine .
The article ‘ Did You Once Serve ?
The counsel I cherished most was , ‘ While you do not have additional responsibilities in the congregation , concentrate on strengthening your spirituality . ’ ”
How has Dennis benefited from the discipline ?
What role can disfellowshipping play in a sinner’s recovery ?
Illustrate .

Robert has been reinstated for some years now and is progressing well spiritually .
What type of clay should we prove to be in the hands of the Great Potter ?
The Great Potter is our Father .
Therefore , ‘ do not reject the discipline of Jehovah , and do not abhor his reproof . ’ ​ — Prov .
The evidence is that this expression refers to spirit sons of God .
The first of those verses reads : “ The sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men , that they were good - looking ; and they went taking wives for themselves , namely , all whom they chose . ” ​ — Gen . 6 : 2 .
What do those texts indicate about these “ sons of God ” ?
“ The sons of the true God ” that we read about at Job 1 : 6 were clearly spirit creatures assembled in God’s presence .
Similarly , at Job 38 : 4 - 7 , we read of “ the sons of God ” who ‘ shouted in applause ’ when God ‘ laid the cornerstone ’ of the earth .
They must have been angelic sons , for humans had not yet been created .
Some find it hard to accept that angels might be interested in having sexual relations .
A similar passage in 1 Peter 3 : 19 , 20 links disobedient angels with “ Noah’s days . ”
Before the Deluge , these wicked spirits materialized in human form ​ — something that God had not purposed for them .
It seems , then , that sometime after his resurrection , Jesus made a proclamation to the wicked spirits regarding the fully justified punishment they are due to receive .
It was not a preaching that held out any hope for them .
It was a preaching of judgment .
In the future , Jesus will bind and throw into the abyss both Satan and those angels .
Angela , * a single sister in her 30 ’ s , is a bit nervous .
She is waiting for the elders .
What are they going to say to her ?
First , though , how would you prepare to make a refreshing shepherding call ?
At times , we all get tired because of our secular work or theocratic responsibilities .
He was helped when the angel Gabriel appeared to him .
10 : 19 .
Similarly , before visiting a fellow believer who may be tired or discouraged , take time to think about his circumstances . What problems does he face ?
Your sincere smile and a few reassuring words may have a good effect .
Michael , an elder for over 40 years , often starts his visits with such comments as : “ You know , one of the nicest privileges of an elder is to visit the brothers in their homes and get to know them better .
So I have really been looking forward to our visit today . ”
“ So when someone reminds us of it , it is refreshing to our soul . ”
You can show your genuine concern for your brothers and sisters by your ongoing interest following the visit .
When concluding the call , you may find it practical to make an appointment to share in the ministry together .
More than ever , our brothers and sisters need to feel cared for , understood , and loved .
Hence , before making a shepherding visit , take time to reflect on your brother’s situation .
Names have been changed .
Some areas are these : our employment or career , the recreation and entertainment we choose , attachment to a disfellowshipped relative , involvement in modern technology , concerns about our health , a wrong view of money , and placing too high a value on our views or position . ​ — 1 / 15 , pages 12 - 21 .
Most who will be resurrected , though , will be brought back to life on earth , with the prospect of living forever here . ​ — 3 / 1 , page 6 .
Satan controls the world , so humans will not be able to bring peace . ​ — 6 / 1 , page 16 .
DRAW CLOSE TO GOD
Every day he allows humans ​ — even the most thankless among them — ​ to benefit from his abundant goodness .
Paul’s words to the people of Lystra teach us several important lessons about Jehovah God .
Note that Jehovah permitted all the Gentile nations “ to go on in their ways . ”
He has not left “ himself without witness , ” explained Paul .
Is it not clear that he wants us to know him ?
As told by Jukka Sylgren
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN : FINLAND
I have loved nature ever since I was a child .
We actively campaigned for animal rights . We distributed information and arranged protest marches and demonstrations against fur shops and animal - testing laboratories .
Even though those organizations managed to get a few small problems corrected , the big problems only seemed to get worse .
For example , Proverbs 12 : 10 says that “ good people take care of their animals . ”
Rather , our problems have grown worse because most people don’t follow his direction .
Thanks to the Bible , I was able to make a lot of changes .
And I adjusted my attitude toward secular authority .
However , I came to appreciate that God’s Kingdom is the only real hope for our world .
I’ve gained peace of mind by leaving matters in Jehovah’s hands .
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
Sophia : Is this about religion ?
Michelle : Yes .
My name is Michelle .
Sophia : Yes , she’s been paralyzed ever since .
Would it be all right if I showed you an example from the Bible ?
Michelle : Notice what the faithful prophet Habakkuk asked God , as recorded at Habakkuk , chapter 1 , verses 2 and 3 : “ How long , O Jehovah , must I cry for help , and you do not hear ?
How long shall I call to you for aid from violence , and you do not save ?
Michelle : Let me show you an example here at Exodus 3 : 7 .
Sophia : True .
Michelle : Consider what the Bible teaches us about God’s power .
Sophia : Sure .
Michelle : Thank you .
Sophia : Yes .
Why does it bother you to see her suffer ?
Michelle : Think of what that means .
Sophia : I never thought of it that way before .

▪ “ Tell Us , When Will These Things Be ? ”
These articles consider parts of Matthew chapters 24 and 25 .
The first article discusses the few through whom he fed his first - century anointed followers .
26 A New Member of the Governing Body
Never before had I preached on my own .
During the first month of my pioneer service , I placed only one booklet ! ​ — Markus .
My father , Hendrik , worked as a shoemaker and gardener in Donderen , a small village in north Drenthe , in the Netherlands .
I remember that I didn’t like Theunis when I first met him , but shortly after World War II , he became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and I noticed that he was much friendlier than he had been before .
Little did I know then that over the years , I would give more than 5,000 talks !
I could hardly sleep for three days .
Shortly after that , I was given a month’s training and started to serve as a circuit servant ( overseer ) .
But before I continue my story , Janny will explain how she became a pioneer and how we served together after we got married .
One week later , I attended my first meeting at the local Kingdom Hall in Assen ( Drenthe ) .

However , I was a minor , so my father got in trouble with the civil authorities for making me leave his house .
In 1952 , after Mother recovered from her illness , I served together with three pioneer sisters for two months as a vacation ( auxiliary ) pioneer .
I became a regular pioneer in 1953 . One year later , a young circuit overseer visited our congregation .
In Flanders , in the north of Belgium , people speak the same language as in the Netherlands .
Because we did not have a place of our own to go to between congregations , we stayed through Monday , traveling to the next congregation on Tuesday morning .
But we always viewed our service as a blessing from Jehovah .
Markus : From the day we got married , it was our desire to attend the Gilead School .
The course would focus mainly on training brothers and giving them organizational instruction .
Janny : In the letter I received that day , I was asked to consider prayerfully whether I would be willing to stay in Belgium while Markus attended Gilead .
Serving at world headquarters and helping prepare literature shipments to Asia , Europe , and South America made me more aware of our international brotherhood .
10 : 24 , 25 .
We missed each other so much !
From 1968 to 1980 , our assignment changed several times from serving at Bethel to serving in the traveling work .
We really enjoyed every assignment that we received , confident that the purpose of any changes in our service was to advance Kingdom interests .
Three years later , the congregation in Louvain kindly offered us an apartment above their Kingdom Hall .
For the first time in 30 years , we had a little place of our own .
After I turned 78 years of age , we were assigned as special pioneers in the town of Lokeren .
We are very happy that we can serve in this way and that we can still go in service every day .
“ We firmly believe that it is not important where we serve nor in what capacity but , rather , whom we serve ”
We have experienced firsthand the truthfulness of Jehovah’s promise that ‘ he will by no means leave us ’ and that if we serve him faithfully , we will ‘ not lack a thing . ’ ​ — Heb .
They are teaching aids that make us think and feel .
They can be especially helpful when we prepare for and participate in the Watchtower Study .
What does it portray ?
With every other illustration , think of how it relates to the subject under discussion and to your own life .
24 : 3 .
JESUS ’ ministry on earth was coming to an end , and his disciples were eager to find out what the future held for them .
( b ) Which three questions will we consider ?
We also discerned that the first part of the great tribulation did not begin in 1914 .
What will signal the beginning of the great tribulation ?
That event will be the beginning of the great tribulation .
( a ) How was ‘ flesh saved ’ in the first century ?
( b ) What can we expect will happen in the future ?
Jesus also foretold : “ Those days will be cut short . ”
In the initial fulfillment , this happened in 66 C.E . when the Roman army “ cut short ” its attack .
The answer is recorded at Ezekiel 38 : 14 - 16 and Matthew 24 : 29 - 31 .
( Read . )
Previously , we thought that the judging of people as sheep or goats would take place during the entire period of the last days from 1914 onward .
Why could the judgment of people as sheep or goats not have started in 1914 ?
( Read Matthew 25 : 31 - 34 , 41 , 46 . )
Since Jesus was not yet active as Judge of all nations in 1914 , his judgment of people as sheep or goats could not have started in that year .
* When , then , will Jesus ’ judgment begin ?
( b ) What events are described at Matthew 24 : 30 , 31 and Matthew 25 : 31 - 33 , 46 ?
Jesus ’ prophecy about the last days reveals that he will for the very first time act as Judge of all nations after the destruction of false religion .
( a ) When will Jesus judge the people as sheep or goats ?
It helps us to see how important our preaching work is .
Until the great tribulation begins , people still have time to change their thinking and start walking on the cramped road “ leading off into life . ”
Nevertheless , we should remember that the final judgment of who are sheep and who are goats is during the great tribulation .
There , Jesus makes eight references to his “ coming , ” or arrival .
Each of these four references applies to Christ’s future coming as Judge .
Where in Jesus ’ prophecy do we find the remaining four references ?
In the parable of the talents , Jesus relates : “ After a long time the master of those slaves came . ”
A consideration of Jesus ’ prophecy in its entirety leads us to what conclusion about Jesus ’ coming ?
So it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus ’ arrival to appoint the faithful slave over all his belongings , mentioned at Matthew 24 : 46 , 47 , also applies to his future coming , during the great tribulation .
We first considered that the great tribulation did not begin in 1914 but will start when the United Nations attacks Babylon the Great .
Paragraph 18 : As noted , the Greek word rendered “ on arriving ” at Matthew 24 : 46 is a form of the same Greek verb that is rendered “ coming ” at Matthew 24 : 30 , 42 , 44 .
“ Look !
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ​ — MATT .
( a ) Summarize the illustration of the wheat and the weeds . ( b ) How did Jesus explain its meaning ?
ONE of Jesus ’ Kingdom illustrations describes a farmer who sows fine seed of wheat and an enemy who sows weeds among the fine seed .
( See the chart “ The Wheat and the Weeds . ” )
Just as a lookout point on a mountain provides a person with a sweeping view of his surroundings , so this parable gives us a panoramic view of developments that would occur during a period of some 2,000 years .
( See also endnote . )
Speaking about the wheat and the weeds , Jesus said : “ Let both grow together until the harvest . ”
( See also endnote . )
What is the larger fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy ?
The Bible Students taught the true meaning of Christ’s ransom sacrifice , exposed the hellfire lie , and proclaimed the coming end of the Gentile Times .
When Jesus began his inspection , what did he find ?
They tried to cause division among the brothers , but in August 1917 , they left Bethel ​ — a cleansing indeed !
Before long , preaching from house to house became a hallmark of those faithful Christians ​ — as it is till this day .
Today , Christendom , as part of the harlot , still says about herself : “ I sit a queen , and I am no widow , and I shall never see mourning . ”
But that is about to change .
( See endnote . )
Then , realizing that there is no escape from destruction , they will weep in desperation and ‘ gnash their teeth ’ in anger .
What will happen to the bundles of weeds ?
4 : 1 .
Fifth , shining brightly .
Jesus ends his prophecy by saying : “ At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . ”
When and where will that be ?
The fulfillment of these words still lies ahead .
Jesus said : “ At that time the righteous ones will shine . ”
Then , as indicated in Jesus ’ prophecy about the great tribulation , they will be gathered to heaven .
Consider three ways .
First , it deepens our insight .
He asked : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”
Later in the illustration , those reaping the weeds are identified as angels . ​ — Matt .
Paragraph 16 : Daniel 12 : 3 states that “ the ones having insight [ anointed Christians ] will shine like the brightness of the expanse . ”
Paragraph 18 : See the book Draw Close to Jehovah , pages 288 - 289 .
14 : 19 .
How did Jesus use the apostles and older men in Jerusalem ?
Upon seeing the crowd , Jesus is moved with pity for the people , so he heals the sick among them and teaches them many things about God’s Kingdom .
Jesus has his disciples tell the crowd to recline on the green grass in groups of 50 and of 100 .
Then , rather than giving the food to the people directly , Jesus distributes it “ to the disciples , the disciples in turn to the crowds . ”
( a ) Jesus was even more concerned about providing what kind of food , and why ?
He knew that taking in spiritual food , the truths found in God’s Word , leads to everlasting life .
Then , in the next article , we will discuss this question of vital importance to each one of us : How can we identify the few through whom Christ feeds us today ?
He knew that they had much to learn ; in fact , they continued to be called “ disciples . ”
He was evidently preparing them for a key role after his death and return to heaven .
Following his resurrection , Jesus provided a clue in a conversation he had with the apostle Peter .
( Read John 21 : 1 , 2 , 15 - 17 . )
Starting at Pentecost 33 C.E . , the resurrected Christ used his apostles as the channel through which he fed the rest of his anointed disciples .
Unhesitatingly , they “ continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles . ”
How did the apostles show that they kept their responsibility to feed Jesus ’ sheep clearly in focus ?
Ironically , the matter involved food ​ — material food . Greek - speaking widows were being overlooked in the daily food distribution , but Hebrew - speaking widows were not being overlooked .
How did the apostles resolve this delicate issue ?
How did Christ use the apostles and older men in Jerusalem ?
( Read Acts 15 : 1 , 2 . )
1 : 18 .
Most definitely !
Is that not proof of Jehovah’s blessing on the arrangement by means of which his Son fed the congregations ?
10 : 22 ; 1 Cor .
“ Through the hands of the apostles many signs and portents continued to occur among the people , ” states Acts 5 : 12 .
But by the end of the first century , the situation changed .
The apostasy made some inroads in the first century , but Jesus ’ faithful apostles acted “ as a restraint , ” holding back the contamination and influence of false teachings .
Additionally , during that time , the weeds became many and the blades of wheat were few .
11 : 25 .
What important developments began to unfold in 1914 ?
In that year , a number of important developments began to unfold .
* Then , starting in 1919 , it was time to begin gathering the wheat .
Which channel would he use ?
Who is the faithful and discreet slave ?
It is vital that we recognize the faithful slave .
4 : 4 ; John 17 : 3 .
How , then , are we to understand Jesus ’ illustration about the faithful slave ?
In the past , our publications have said the following : At Pentecost 33 C.E . , Jesus appointed the faithful slave over his domestics .
The first portion of the prophecy , recorded at Matthew 24 : 4 - 22 , has two fulfillments ​ — first , in the years from 33 C.E . through 70 C.E . , and second , in a more far - reaching way in our day .
* In this context ​ — when speaking about events that would take place in the last days — ​ Jesus related the illustration of the faithful slave .
In 1914 , however , the situation was much different .

Such ones are called “ a royal priesthood ” and have been commissioned to “ ‘ declare abroad the excellencies ’ of the one that called [ them ] out of darkness into his wonderful light . ”
12 : 17 .
Explain .
Among the wheat are anointed brothers who may serve as ministerial servants or elders in their local congregation .
But they do not have a part in dispensing spiritual food to the worldwide brotherhood .
11 : 3 ; 14 : 34 .
Who , then , is the faithful and discreet slave ?
From which group would Jesus select and appoint the faithful slave ?
( b ) What warning did Jesus give to the faithful and discreet slave ?
( See the box “ If Ever That Evil Slave . . . ” )
When does Jesus make the second appointment ​ — “ over all his belongings ” ?
Jesus said : “ Happy is that slave if his master on arriving [ literally , “ having come , ” ftn . ] finds him doing so .
In view of the foregoing , what can we conclude ?
Does the faithful slave receive a greater reward in heaven than the rest of the anointed ?
No .
A reward promised to a small group in one setting may ultimately be shared by others .
All of the 144,000 will share Jesus ’ vast heavenly authority ( See paragraph 19 )
Why did Jesus appoint the faithful slave , and what is your determination ?
By means of the faithful and discreet slave , Jesus is following the pattern he set in the first century ​ — feeding many through the hands of a few .
Let us be determined to show our appreciation by giving our loyal support to the anointed brothers who make up that faithful and discreet slave . ​ — Heb .
13 : 7 , 17 .
Paragraph 2 : On an earlier occasion , Jesus related a similar illustration in which he referred to the “ slave ” as a “ steward ” and to the “ domestics ” as “ his body of attendants . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 42 - 44 .
“ Appointed over his domestics ” : In 1919 , Jesus selected capable anointed brothers to be his faithful and discreet slave
Jesus warned about an evil slave who concludes in his heart that the master is delaying and who starts to beat his fellow slaves .
However , the composite faithful and discreet slave has continued to keep on the watch and to provide nourishing spiritual food .
The anointed brothers who together serve as the faithful slave recognize that they are accountable to the Master for the way they care for his domestics .
On Wednesday morning , September 5 , 2012 , it was announced to the United States and Canada Bethel families that a new member had been added to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Effective September 1 , 2012 , Mark Sanderson began to serve in that capacity .
Brother Sanderson was raised in San Diego , California , U.S.A . , by his Christian parents and was baptized on February 9 , 1975 .
In December 1990 , he graduated from the seventh class of the Ministerial Training School ( now called the Bible School for Single Brothers ) in the United States .

More people in more places are consuming more pornography than at any other time in history . ​ — See the box “ Facts About Pornography . ”
The nature of pornography is also changing .
Jesus said : “ Every good tree produces fine fruit , but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit . ”
I would literally shake and develop pains in my head . I struggled to stop , but years later I was still addicted . ”
People who indulge in pornography often cover up their habit .
Senate committee , Dr . Judith Reisman , a leading researcher on pornography , said : “ Pornographic visual images imprint and alter the brain , triggering an instant , involuntary , but lasting , biochemical memory trail [ that is ] difficult or impossible to delete . ”
Susan , 19 , who was exposed to pornographic Web sites , relates : “ The images are engraved on my mind .
WHAT EXPERTS SAY : “ Couples and families break up over porn . ” ​ — The Porn Trap , by Wendy and Larry Maltz .
Pornography damages marriages and families by
Promoting selfishness , emotional aloofness , and dissatisfaction with one’s mate . ​ — Ephesians 5 : 28 , 29 .
Infidelity is the kind of treachery that can devastate a marriage and lead to separation and divorce .
Studies show that pornography can influence adolescents to become sexually active at younger ages and also to become promiscuous , sexually violent , and emotionally and psychologically unstable .
THE BOTTOM LINE : Pornography poisons loving relationships and ultimately brings heartache and pain . ​ — Proverbs 6 : 27 .
Consider just a few reasons .
Jehovah knows that pornography reflects a warped , selfish , satanic view of sex . ​ — Genesis 6 : 2 ; Jude 6 , 7 .
He invites humble ones to turn to him to “ obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time . ” ​ — Hebrews 4 : 16 ; see the box “ Breaking Free From Pornography . ”
Notice what the Bible says about some who overcame bad habits : “ You have been washed clean , . . . you have been sanctified , . . . you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God . ”
“ When I’m tempted to gaze lustfully at a woman , I immediately pray to Jehovah and force my eyes to look away , ” says Franz .
Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible .
Being the eldest of ten children , at the age of 13 , I started working to help provide for the family .
On the other hand , I was exposed to some harmful influences on the farms .
I often heard swearing , and I had easy access to cigarettes .
I found an old issue of The Watchtower , which contained the address of the Australia branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Soon he was studying the Bible with me .
That verse encourages us to “ cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh . ”
I decided that I would quit smoking and stop abusing alcohol .
It was not easy to make those changes , as these habits had been a part of my life for a long time .
Even so , I didn’t succeed immediately in cleaning up my language .
I reasoned that if God had the power to create the vast universe ​ — which I so loved to look at — ​ surely he could give me the strength to make changes in order to please him .
I agree completely with the words of Proverbs 10 : 22 , which reads : “ The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich . ”
Paul said : “ His [ God’s ] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward , because they are perceived by the things made , even his eternal power and Godship , so that they are inexcusable . ”
Let us take a closer look at Paul’s words .
Do not the starry heavens and the pounding surf reveal his power ?
One scholar illustrates it this way : Imagine a driver who ignores a sign that says “ Detour ​ — Turn Left . ”
A police officer stops him and starts writing him a ticket .
There is no excuse for ignoring it .

8 Questions From Readers
28 Elisha Saw Fiery Chariots ​ — Do You ?
“ You have been washed clean , . . . you have been sanctified . ” ​ — 1 COR .
( See opening image . )
RESIDENTS of Jerusalem are talking .
These are just some of the disturbing developments that Nehemiah discovers when he returns to Jerusalem sometime after 443 B.C.E . ​ — Neh .
Israel was a nation dedicated to God . In 1513 B.C.E . , the Israelites were eager to comply with Jehovah’s will .
What a privilege that was !
By the time that Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem a second time , about a hundred years had passed since a faithful remnant had returned from Babylon to restore true worship .
Once again , the nation’s zeal for spiritual things was flagging .
Both anointed Christians and those of the “ great crowd ” are holy , set apart for sacred service .
Tobiah had become a close associate of Eliashib .
How do elders and others avoid defiling their sanctified position before Jehovah ?
Unless we adhere to his righteous standards , we will not remain sanctified before him .
Why were the temple arrangements being disrupted , and whom did Nehemiah blame for this ?
So Nehemiah took steps to have the tithes collected .
He appointed trustworthy men to oversee the temple stores and future distributions .
Is there a lesson here for us ?
We may not think that we have much to give , but if the desire is there , all of us can have a share . ​ — 2 Cor .
How were some of the Jews not respecting the Sabbath ?
For some of Nehemiah’s contemporaries , though , the Sabbath had become just another day ​ — business as usual . Worship was being pushed into the background .
One lesson is that we should limit our commercial interests .
( Read Matthew 6 : 24 . )
Likewise today , Christian elders and ministerial servants focus on doing things for the benefit of the congregation , and their fellow believers love them for this spirit .
Although Christians are not required to observe a weekly Sabbath , Paul tells us that “ there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God . ”
6 : 33 .
When they got older , would they identify themselves as Israelites ?
Help your children to develop a close relationship with Jehovah ( See paragraphs 17 , 18 )
Today , we need to take positive action in order to help our children acquire a Christian identity .
It takes time to learn a language , especially when we are surrounded by distractions .
Why are Christian parents in the best position to prepare their children for making a dedication to Jehovah ?
Parents , no one is in a better position than you are to prepare your children for making a dedication to Jehovah .
How can we be remembered by Jehovah “ for good ” ?
One of Nehemiah’s contemporaries was the prophet Malachi , who revealed that “ a book of remembrance began to be written up . . . for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name . ”
6 : 10 .
Like Nehemiah , our names will be in God’s book of remembrance if we continue to avoid bad associations , support theocratic arrangements , give spiritual matters priority , and safeguard our Christian identity .
But one day when you return home , you find that everything in your house has been turned upside down .
Our study of the Scriptures has helped us to identify the real cause of many of the world’s difficulties .
It is none other than Satan the Devil , “ the ruler of the world . ” ​ — John 14 : 30 ; 2 Cor .
Because some of our problems are the result of our own mistakes .
In what way ?
How could a Christian become “ enraged against Jehovah ” ?
Surely to do so would be futile .
This attitude could manifest itself in subtle ways .
As a result , that person might withdraw from the congregation or not fully support arrangements for Jehovah’s worship .
How can we avoid that trap ?
It is vital that we know the answers to these questions . Why , our very relationship with Jehovah God is involved !
6 , 7 .
10 : 11 , 12 .
What resulted ?

What caused God’s people in Isaiah’s day to start to blame Jehovah for their situation ?
But more important , there was a spiritual famine .

We do not know all the facts .
Because of not having all the facts , the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day felt that Jehovah’s way was “ not adjusted right . ”
Since that time , others have followed Adam’s example of blaming God for their own mistakes .
What lesson can we learn from Jonah ?
The prophet Jonah had a problem with Jehovah’s merciful decision regarding Nineveh .
Could we likewise become so self - centered that we become “ enraged against Jehovah ” for not bringing the end sooner ?
3 : 3 , 4 , 9 .
Do not allow negative speech to affect you .
If we meditate on Jehovah’s activities , remembering all the good things he has done for us , we will strengthen our relationship with him .
What if we have a negative attitude toward our fellow worshippers ? Under such circumstances , our relationship with Jehovah can be affected .
13 : 7 , 17 .
16 , 17 .
10 : 13 .
Jehovah hates injustice ; he loves righteousness .
No doubt , you have experienced the truthfulness of this proverb : “ The first to present his case seems right , till another comes forward and questions him . ” ​ — Prov .
Well , we may be responsible for some of our problems .
Why would such a course be unreasonable ?
Consider this example : A car may be capable of traveling at a high speed .
Imagine that a driver greatly exceeds the recommended speed limit when traveling around a sharp curve and he crashes .
No , of course not !
Of course , not all our problems are a result of our personal mistakes and wrong actions .
5 : 8 .
Joshua and Caleb were blessed for their trust in Jehovah ( See paragraph 22 )
When you are undergoing hardship and difficulties , remember the example of Joshua and Caleb .
They trusted in Jehovah . Were they blessed ?
“ Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works . ” ​ — HEB .
10 : 24 .
How can we ‘ encourage one another ’ ?
4 : 7 .
After the establishment of God’s Kingdom in 1914 , Satan was ousted from heaven and confined to the vicinity of the earth , having “ great anger , knowing he has a short period of time . ”
Sometimes the cumulative effect of our difficulties can wear us down so much that whatever emotional and spiritual strength we muster up may not be enough for us to cope with the discouragement .
What does it mean to “ consider one another , ” and what effort does doing so require ?
Can we closely consider the needs of others if we limit our conversations with them to a quick greeting at the Kingdom Hall or a discussion of only trivial matters ?
How can they carry out the shepherding work effectively unless they really know the sheep in their care ?
If elders make themselves available to fellow believers and enjoy being with them , the sheep will be more likely to ask for assistance when needed .
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 14 . )
When ‘ considering ’ such ones , we need to keep in mind that what they say may not be a true reflection of what they really are at heart .
Most of these times , I tried to remind myself of the kind of person Mom really is ​ — loving , kind , and generous .
I learned that depressed people say many things they do not mean .
Therefore I exhort you to confirm your love for him . ”
“ Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works , ” wrote Paul .
“ My father never once said I did anything well , ” one elder wrote .
Although I am now 50 years old , I still appreciate being reassured by my friends that I am doing a good job as an elder . . . .
When ‘ those who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust a man who has taken a false step , ’ loving counsel and appropriate commendation may motivate the wrongdoer to return to the course of fine works .
This made her feel unworthy of Jehovah’s love , and she contemplated leaving the truth .
When an elder reminded her of her past faithful service , her emotions were stirred .
She allowed the elders an opportunity to reassure her of Jehovah’s love .
On the other hand , giving a fellow believer commendation and appealing to his love for God can have a lasting , positive effect . ​ — Read Philippians 2 : 1 - 4 .
( See opening image . )
Consider how one compassionate elder was able to help a brother who had been inactive for several years .
As the elder listened to him , it became clear that the brother still had a deep love for Jehovah .
He diligently studied every issue of The Watchtower and was making an effort to attend meetings regularly .
The elder invited the brother to join him in the preaching work .
With the elder’s help , the brother resumed his ministry and eventually qualified to serve again as an elder . Listen patiently to a person who needs encouragement ( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )
In the past , Jehovah dealt patiently with those of his servants who at times were discouraged .
Satan does not hesitate to use lies and deceit to seduce us and draw us away from the God we worship .
In an attempt to destroy our relationship with God , what does Satan target , and why ?
By what means does Satan make our heart his target ?
Before considering measures we can take to protect ourselves in this regard , let us see how the Devil successfully used certain enticements with Eve but unsuccessfully with the Son of God .
The Creator designed the earth to produce food bountifully .
Satan may try to appeal to the natural desire for food in an effort to turn us away from doing God’s will .
Consider how he did that with Eve .
Satan used the same tactic when he tried to tempt Jesus in the wilderness .
Jesus had two options : He could choose not to use his miraculous power to satisfy the need for food , or he could choose to use it .
In the case of Eve , Satan appealed to this desire , saying : “ Your eyes are bound to be opened . ”
In no way did Jesus want to be the kind of person Satan wanted him to be .
Pride was apparently a factor that caused her to accept the lie .
How wrong she was !
13 , 14 .
And what temptation materialism , power , and fame hold for the proud and for those inclined to make ‘ a showy display of their means of life ’ !
They are attractive , but attached to each lure is a hook .
If we are diligent students of the Bible , we will be well - acquainted with the Scriptures and be able to bring to mind the verses that can help us to keep our thinking straight in the face of temptation .
Remembering Scriptural examples of faithful individuals who were loyal to God will help us to imitate them .
Another factor that helps us to resist “ the things in the world ” is that we keep in mind John’s inspired words : “ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but he that does the will of God remains forever . ”
Maretha du Raan
Because the neural tube in my spine failed to close completely , nerve damage has made it difficult for me to walk and has caused other serious health problems .
Hence , we considered the material for congregation meetings as a family .
I became a Kingdom publisher and got baptized at age 19 .
Some time later , I heard a circuit overseer speak on the subject of pioneering .
As a pioneer , I have constantly experienced Jehovah’s support .
I have derived immense joy from helping a number of individuals to dedication and baptism .
Along with joy , the birth of a child brings serious responsibilities .
So Manoah prayed : “ Excuse me , Jehovah . The man of the true God that you just sent , let him , please , come again to us and instruct us as to what we ought to do to the child that will be born . ”
By the time she was two years old , she was confidently offering tracts to those we met in the field service . ”
After all , they are curious and are trying to explore the world around them .
Since repetition helps adults to remember important matters , it will surely help young children !
Striking a balance between training a child , caring for theocratic responsibilities , and doing secular work posed a challenge for one Christian overseer whose wife has a busy schedule as a regular pioneer .
Children are thus likened to arrows that should be accurately aimed at the target .
Christian parents can express similar gratitude when they see their children “ go on walking in the truth . ”
The account goes on to say : “ Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant’s eyes , so that he saw ; and , look !
the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all around Elisha . ”
What can we learn from this and other events in Elisha’s life ?
Let us consider how we can benefit from other incidents in Elisha’s life .
On one occasion , when Elisha was plowing a field , the prophet Elijah approached him and threw his own official garment upon him .
Elisha knew what that meant .
He held a feast , said good - bye to his father and mother , and left home to minister to Elijah .
Because Elisha readily made himself available to serve God as fully as possible , he became an instrument in Jehovah’s hand and eventually served as prophet in place of Elijah .
During that time , Elisha was the one ‘ who poured out water upon Elijah’s hands . ’
No Christian should consider such service insignificant or demeaning , for Jehovah values it highly . ​ — Heb .
Elijah suggested that his companion not accompany him , but Elisha replied : “ I will not leave you . ”
As the two men were traveling , Elijah said to Elisha : “ Ask what I should do for you before I am taken from you . ”
Just as Solomon’s request made years earlier was of a spiritual nature , so was Elisha’s .
In effect , then , Elisha asked to be recognized as Elijah’s spiritual heir .
“ You have asked a difficult thing , ” said the prophet . “ If you see me when taken from you , it will happen to you that way ; but if you do not , it will not happen . ”
Elijah’s answer apparently had a twofold significance .
Second , if Elisha was to receive it , he had to maintain his resolve to stay with Elijah , come what may .
Though surrounded by enemies at Dothan , Elisha remained calm .
Because he had developed strong faith in Jehovah .
“ Oh , he’s a great King , ” Sobhuza acknowledged with deep respect .
Robert wrote : ‘ I was very much struck with the nature of the Paramount Chief , King Sobhuza .
‘ Later that day , ’ continued Robert , ‘ we called at The Swazi National School where we had the most interesting experience of all .
When we mentioned the machine and offered to let the whole school hear the recordings , he was delighted and summoned almost a hundred students to sit on the grass to listen .
Therefore , the Witnesses had good reason for being grateful to him , and they sincerely mourned his death .
With just over one million inhabitants , this country had a ratio of 1 publisher to every 384 of the population .
A solid foundation certainly was laid during those early visits to Swaziland in the 1930 ’ s . ​ — From our archives in South Africa . The Golden Age , June 30 , 1937 , page 629 .
There is no reason to be unduly concerned about the seating location of a disfellowshipped person in the Kingdom Hall .
Since it is not required that a disfellowshipped person sit at the back of the hall , there should be no objection if a disfellowshipped child sits next to his parents , wherever they are sitting .
Having the child sit with them rather than leaving the young person unattended elsewhere may be helpful in this regard .
If all present , including faithful relatives , are endeavoring to respect Bible principles relating to disfellowshipping , and it is not becoming a cause for stumbling to the brothers , there is no need to make an issue of the seating arrangements of those attending Christian meetings . *
Although this article refers to the disfellowshipped minor as a male , the points presented also apply to a female .
See The Watchtower , September 15 , 1981 , pages 29 and 30 .
There I was born in December 1939 .
In the early 1930 ’ s , they had become Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Mother also became a Witness after acknowledging that grandfather knew the Bible better than the village priest .
In 1947 , after World War II , he returned home with a broken back .
Although a physical wreck , he stood firm in his faith .
We were exhausted and heavyhearted .
They took them to the north and the east .
This continued for an hour or so . We sang more songs , and then more Bible questions were entertained .
At Dzhankoy railway station , about 1974 By 1960 , greater freedom was granted to the exiled Witnesses .
But our work was not tightly restricted , nor were we actively persecuted .
So a spirit of complacency developed among some Witnesses .
Teams of Witness women cleaned the park surrounding the stadium .
Those working in the rooming department scoured the city to find accommodations for the 15,000 delegates expected .
Each morning , members of the Convention Committee left their office to meet with city officials .

What kind of gift would make you feel truly appreciative ?
A genuine Christian gives because he has decided “ in his heart ” to do so , notes Paul .
At the same time , a Christian devotes more than passing attention to the needs of his fellow worshippers .
So a Christian ponders the needs of fellow believers and asks himself what he can do to fill those needs . ​ — 1 John 3 : 17 .
The Greek expression rendered “ grudgingly ” literally means “ out of sadness ( or , grief ) . ”
“ God loves a cheerful giver . ”
Indeed , happiness is a by - product of giving that is properly motivated .
A cheerful giver touches our heart . He also warms God’s heart .
Another translation says : “ God loves people who love to give . ” ​ — Contemporary English Version .

That can hurt , can’t it ? — God too can feel hurt when lies are told about him .
Who were these two ? — Yes , Adam and then , sometime later , Eve .
Let’s see how this happened .
Before God created Eve , he had told Adam : “ From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction . But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will positively die . ”
Just as a person can make a puppet appear to speak , someone made that snake appear to speak .
Whose voice was coming from the serpent ? — It was the voice of “ the original serpent , the one called Devil and Satan . ”
We will consider eight ways that a Christian’s relationship with Jehovah can be strengthened by pioneering .

You might say something like , “ They said that all the fruit was ripe ; however , these are still very hard . ”
“ I came , not to destroy [ the Law ] , but to fulfill . ”
You may find it both enjoyable and meaningful to consider the accompanying chart that sets out some contrasts that you find in Ephesians chapters 4 and 5 .
Ask yourself : ‘ Honestly , what is my attitude ?
How do I react in this or a similar situation ?
Which side of the contrast would others think represents me ? ’
If you discern that a particular contrast brings to the fore an area you need to work on , try to do that . Let that contrast help you .
As you become more aware of the value of contrasts , you may become more adept at recognizing them in the Bible , and you may find that they are very helpful in your Christian ministry .
Yes , the Scriptures present us with many instructive contrasts , which can help us to walk in God’s way .
“ You should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct . ” ​ — 4 : 22 .
“ Let a rotten saying not proceed out of your mouth . ” ​ — 4 : 29 .
“ You were once darkness . ” ​ — 5 : 8 .
“ Quit sharing with them in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness . ” ​ — 5 : 11 .
“ But go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is . ” ​ — 5 : 17 .
“ But he feeds and cherishes it , as the Christ also does the congregation . ” ​ — 5 : 29 .
Studying about God’s Kingdom , the ransom , the disciple - making work , and such qualities as love and faith is a regular part of our spiritual diet .
Why did Jehovah fight for King Hezekiah ?
He did not turn aside to the right or to the left . ”
In so doing , Josiah brought blessings not only to himself but also to the entire nation . ​ — Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 31 - 33 .
26 : 23 - 25 ; Jer .
How can we learn from Israel’s example ?
God’s inspired Word can serve as a reminder to us every time we read it .
As free moral agents , we can choose to obey Jehovah’s directions or we can pursue what seems right in our own eyes .
Using a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night , Jehovah reminded the Israelites that he was backing them as he led them across that inhospitable terrain .
“ Their very garments did not wear out , and their feet themselves did not become swollen . ”
9 : 19 - 21 .
God’s servants today are on the threshold of a righteous new world .
Have we made adjustments in order to follow these instructions ?
Jesus ’ example should move all of us to be humble in our dealings with one another . ​ — Phil .
Jesus said that the second greatest commandment is to “ love your neighbor as yourself . ”
Jesus showed personal interest in people .
We see his loving concern when he healed the sick and infirm and when he resurrected the dead .
No , for it was an expression of God’s love , which helped them to “ go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 18 .
( Read Joshua 23 : 14 . )
Within its pages , we find God’s dealings with imperfect humankind over thousands of years .
119 : 111 .
Reactions may range from sorrow , sadness , or shame to feeling motivated , challenged , and involved .
One factor is pride .
King David had many ups and downs in his life , but one thing remained constant ​ — his implicit trust in his Creator .
Many people pray to God only when they are in sore straits .
What if the only time you heard from a friend or a relative was when he needed money or a personal favor ?
His relationship with Jehovah reflected his faith in and love for his God throughout his life ​ — in good times and bad . ​ — Ps .
40 : 8 .
Like David , we need to communicate with Jehovah regularly in order to build trust in him .
Drawing close to God in prayer is also an important way that we obtain holy spirit . ​ — Read 1 John 3 : 22 .
Why should we avoid offering repetitious prayers ?
The more we pour out our heart to Jehovah , the closer we will be to him and the more we will trust in him .
Analyzing such expressions made by loyal ones can help us to offer up meaningful prayers to Jehovah .
Getting God’s mind on such matters will help us to anticipate problems .
For example , do we truly believe that Babylon the Great will soon be destroyed ?
Some things mentioned in the Bible may not be fully understood now because it is not yet Jehovah’s due time for making them clear .
They got the sense after his death and resurrection when he materialized a human body , appeared to a number of disciples , and “ opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures . ”
We can be sure that doing so will help us to build trust in his promises .
In imitation of our Creator , we keep busy in theocratic activities .
Why can we say that acts of faith help us to build trust in Jehovah’s counsel ?
Give an example .
However , as the people made their approach , they could see that the spring rains had caused the river to swell to flood stage .
Set up camp on the river bank and wait weeks or longer for the floodwaters to recede ?
( See paragraphs 17 , 18 ) True , Jehovah does not perform such miracles in behalf of his people today , but he does bless their acts of faith .
Many Witnesses who may have had a tendency to be shy or timid can personally attest that God’s holy spirit has given them the courage to speak to strangers in the field ministry . ​ — Read Psalm 119 : 46 ; 2 Corinthians 4 : 7 .
Our worship involves expending our time , energy , and material resources to the fullest extent possible .
And it helps us to build an unbreakable bond of trust with our Creator . ​ — Rom .
And continue to build trust in Jehovah through acts of worship .
We dress a certain way ; we like certain foods ; we behave in a certain manner .
Our choices may even reflect the proddings of our conscience .
For what two reasons do Christians not simply go along with commonly accepted ways and standards ?
First , the Bible reminds us : “ There exists a way that is upright before a man , but the ways of death are the end of it afterward . ”
What will we consider in this article ?
( 2 ) What does the transformation involve ?
The apostle Paul’s words recorded in the letter to the Romans were addressed , not to unbelievers or the general populace , but to his fellow anointed Christians .
What kind of influences did it exert on our brothers and sisters back then ?
Such vestiges of the past offer insight into the social and religious life in ancient Rome .
Rome was also a prosperous center of commerce , so opportunities for material gains abounded . ​ — Rom .
6 : 21 ; 1 Pet .
4 : 3 , 4 .
Despite their many temples with their pantheon of gods , the Romans were not known to cultivate a real , personal relationship with the gods they worshipped .
Because the spirit of the world is manifest in many ways .
Reflecting this progress , he makes changes in his life according to what he has learned .
He puts away false religious practices and undesirable traits of his former way of life and cultivates the Christlike personality .
How is transformation different from improvement ?
As to the expression “ be transformed , ” a note in Vine’s Expository Dictionary explains : “ In Rom [ ans ] 12 : 2 being outwardly conformed to the things of this age [ or system of things ] is contrasted with being transformed ( or transfigured ) inwardly by the renewal of the thoughts through the Holy Spirit’s power . ”
“ Be transformed by making your mind over , ” Paul wrote .
The “ mind ” relates to our thinking faculties .
Why should we make an honest appraisal of ourselves ?
Such things may be hidden from public view .
The transformation involves what we are inside , so to bring it about , we need something that can penetrate the surface , reaching deep inside us .
What can help us in that way ?
4 : 12 .
First , the clay needs to be washed to remove any foreign material or mineral contamination .
1 : 2 ; Acts 17 : 11 ; Heb .
Being transformed will help you handle problems in a better way than in the past ( See paragraph 18 )
( b ) What questions can be helpful ?
For God’s Word to produce in us needed transformation , regularly reading and learning from the Bible is but a beginning .
What is missing ?
Have I not seen that it is the truth ?
Moreover , do I see ways to apply in my own life what I am learning and not view it only as something I might teach to others ?
Do I feel that Jehovah is talking to me personally ? ’
Doing all we can to put away the thinking and attitudes we formerly had and letting ourselves be transformed will result in blessings , as we will see in the following article .
See the example given in The Watchtower of February 1 , 1994 , page 9 , paragraph 7 .
1 , 2 .
Every day we are faced with many of them .
How do you feel about the typical decisions that you face ?
As servants of Jehovah , we can be happy that he has provided clear directions regarding many of the important matters in our life .
For example , we know that we should not steal .
Though we are far from being sound in body and mind , Jehovah , our heavenly Father , is perfect in every respect .
Relate an experience of how a sound decision can be made in spite of pressures or hardship .
* A woman living in a foreign country gave birth to a lovely baby boy .
Her husband saw how the members of the congregation rallied to help and how happy and healthy the baby was turning out to be .
He accepted a Bible study and commenced attending meetings with his wife .
Our imperfect mind and heart can be like a watch that is going either too fast or too slow .
However , genuine progress is possible for such spiritual babes , as the Bible refers to them .
The key to success usually lies in his taking small steps and doing so repeatedly .
When we make the right choices in daily matters , we train our perceptive powers ( See paragraph 11 )
What is needed to make sure that we follow through on the decisions we have made ?
For example , some who want to quit smoking fail because they lack sufficient motivation .
Paul knew this from personal experience .
He confessed : “ I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within , but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members . ”
By no means .
In sharp contrast , years earlier , Joshua set a fine example when he told the Israelites : “ If it is bad in your eyes to serve Jehovah , choose for yourselves today whom you will serve . . .
Joshua and those who stuck with him were blessed with settling in the Promised Land , “ a land flowing with milk and honey . ” ​ — Josh .
The Greater Moses , Jesus Christ , has been leading true worshippers of Jehovah through the wilderness of Satan’s world for many decades .
As the Greater Joshua , Jesus is now poised to bring that corrupt system to its end and lead his followers to the promised new world of righteousness .
147 : 1 .
If you are a pioneer , what can help you to continue in this rewarding avenue of service ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What can result from thinking and speaking about a loved one ?
People in the world have no reliable guidance to help them achieve success and happiness .
Helping others spiritually makes it easier for us to avoid becoming overwhelmed by personal problems .
Those children were a gift from Jehovah , especially that day . ”
To do so effectively requires that they prepare for each study and perhaps do research to answer questions .
A pioneer named Janeen explains : “ Each time I have an opportunity to teach the truth to others , I feel that a deeper impression of these truths is engraved on my mind and heart .
As a result , my faith is not stagnant but continues to grow . ”
Adrianna , another pioneer , comments : “ People’s lives can be a mess when they rely on their own wisdom .


Pioneering with our marriage mate can do what for the threefold marital cord ?
Madeline , who pioneers along with her husband , explains : “ My husband and I are able to spend time talking about our day in the ministry or something in our Bible reading that can be applied in our ministry .
When we put the Kingdom first and experience God’s support , how is our trust in Jehovah affected ?
He might ask : ‘ How much time am I actually expending on recreation or leisure pursuits ?
Any Christian will admit that it is easy to add things to one’s schedule ; thus , those in the full - time service may need to assess matters regularly and make adjustments if needed .
First , though , he reads his mail .
4 : 16 .
If you do not at this point see how that is possible , do all you can to increase your closeness to Jehovah by having a full share in the ministry .
Furthermore , you will have more opportunities to think and talk about Jehovah , deepening your love for him and bringing him pleasure .
When a loved one dies , we naturally shed tears because we will miss him .
Though he had affection for Lazarus , Jesus did not give way to tears because Lazarus died .
He shed tears out of compassion for the bereaved , as indicated by the context of John’s account . ​ — John 11 : 36 .
He said : “ This sickness is not with death as its object , but is for the glory of God , in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it . ”
Death was not the “ object , ” or end result , of Lazarus ’ sickness .
Jesus intended to use Lazarus ’ death “ for the glory of God . ”
To Jesus , raising Lazarus from death would be like a parent waking his child from a nap .
When Jesus met Lazarus ’ sister Mary and saw her and others weeping , he “ groaned in the spirit and became troubled . ”
Likewise , our empathy may move us to “ weep with people who weep . ”

The Bible also relates the historic struggle of good versus evil : a fascinating , universal drama with a happy ending .
Simply , in few words , Genesis , the first book of the Bible , explains the origin of the universe : “ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . ”
After God created plants and animals , he created the first humans , Adam and Eve .
Speaking through a serpent , Satan deceived Eve , telling her that she would be better off without God’s guidance .
Adam and Eve followed Satan , breaking their tie with their Maker .
Immediately , God declared his intention to rectify this sad situation and give Adam’s descendants a way to gain endless life .
God determined to destroy the wicked in a flood .
Abraham’s grandson Jacob later moved to Egypt , where his family grew to become the ancient nation of Israel .
Later , in Egypt , a tyrannical Pharaoh enslaved the Israelites until God raised up the prophet Moses , who led the nation out of the country through the miraculously parted waters of the Red Sea .
They foretold that he would be humble and kind and that under his rule hunger , injustice , and war would end .
All mankind would be at peace with one another and even with the animals .
Some four centuries after the last book of the Hebrew portion of the Bible was written , Micah’s prophecy about the Messiah was fulfilled : Jesus was born in Bethlehem .
Jesus was baptized , and God anointed him with holy spirit .
Paul himself was put in prison .

But what if others sin against us ?
As I was growing up , I reacted to the negative influences by becoming extremely violent .
On one occasion , a rival gang hired an infamous hit man to kill me , but I managed to escape with only a stab wound .
After our first son was born , I became terrified that because of my violent temper , I would turn out like my stepfather and abuse my family .
Meanwhile , my wife was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
I was surprised to realize that in my religion I had learned about a god , but not about Jehovah .
Those verses say that the fruitage of God’s spirit is “ love , joy , peace , long - suffering , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self - control . ”
I feel that he has lifted me up out of the mire that had me trapped .
However , the Creator of life can bring the dead back by means of a resurrection .
These will be given a fresh start , with the prospect of living forever . ​ — Read Psalm 37 : 29 ; Acts 24 : 15 .

ABOUT ten years ago , Gregorio and Marilou , a married couple in their 30 ’ s , were serving as pioneers in Manila while at the same time holding full - time jobs .
“ Our good jobs allowed us to enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle , ” she says .
They entered a contract with a developer and arranged to pay for the project in monthly installments within ten years .
“ We felt that these talks were Jehovah’s answer to our prayers , ” says Gregorio .
They had already made three years ’ worth of payments .
What were they to do ?
Says Marilou : “ If we ended the contract , we would lose all we had paid so far ​ — a significant amount .

How does creation reveal God’s power and wisdom ?
After all , the Bible says that “ no man has seen God at any time . ”
Then we must skillfully use the Bible to overturn any reasonings that are “ raised up against the knowledge of God . ” ​ — 2 Cor .
In its basic form , the teaching of evolution asserts that all life came into existence spontaneously ; it thus implies that human life has no purpose .
Individuals who promote such views might remind us of some in the first century who had a zeal for God “ but not according to accurate knowledge . ”
The Bible teaches us to treasure knowledge .
You could consider some of the following evidence from creation that reveals our Creator’s power and wisdom .
The atmosphere , for example , does more than provide us with air to breathe .
This field safeguards us from the radiation emanating from solar flares and explosions in the outer regions of the sun .
Instead , they are absorbed and deflected .
It contains a finite amount of fresh water , and we can hardly export waste products into outer space .
Billions of creatures take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide .
Why not ?
What remarkable wisdom !
God’s wisdom is seen in the design of the dragonfly’s eye ; inset shows a magnified view ( See paragraph 11 )
Jehovah designed its minute brain with the ability to compensate for the sun’s movement .
This creature sees by means of two compound eyes .
How much information does DNA contain ?

Perhaps you have teenage children who are attending high school .
Scientists , schoolteachers , nature documentaries , and even the entertainment world , with its TV shows and movies , promote the idea that evolution is a fact .
You can help your teens to combat such propaganda by using another brochure , The Origin of Life ​ — Five Questions Worth Asking , which was also released in 2010 .
Parents , if you use these brochures , you can do much to boost your children’s confidence in their ability to give an answer to those who demand a reason for their belief in a Creator . ​ — Read 1 Peter 3 : 15 .

Contrast the common view of slavery with that encouraged at Romans 12 : 11 . CHRISTIAN slavery differs greatly from what many people think about the subject of slavery .
In fact , when the apostle Paul admonished first - century Christians to “ slave for Jehovah , ” he was encouraging sacred service prompted by love of God .
How can we avoid becoming enslaved to Satan and his world ?
Our dedication sprang from our desire to obey Jehovah and to do his will .
The basis for Christian dedication is love of our heavenly Master , Jehovah .
How thankful we are to Jehovah for making it possible for us to be his slaves !
Then he warned : “ Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him , you are slaves of him because you obey him , either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view ?
Yes , since you were set free from sin , you became slaves to righteousness . ”
Notice that the apostle refers to ‘ obedience from the heart . ’

He seeks to enslave us by tempting us to give in to his corrupting influence .

Referring to those in the first - century Christian congregation who had adopted a worldly viewpoint , Peter warned : “ They consider luxurious living in the daytime a pleasure .
For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one . ” ​ — 2 Pet .
2 : 13 , 18 , 19 .
This slave must have felt temporary pain ; but it soon passed , leaving a permanent sign of his servitude .
Their delight is in the law of Jehovah , and they meditate on it day and night .
( Read Psalm 1 : 1 - 3 . )
In his first letter to the Corinthians , Paul asked : “ Were you called when a slave ? ”
He then advised them : “ Do not let it worry you ; but if you can also become free , rather seize the opportunity . ”
Continuing one’s education to promote a career in this world could curtail one’s freedom to pursue full - time service . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 23 . Which master will you slave for ?
“ The philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men ” surfaces today in the worldly thinking promoted by many intellectuals .
Higher education , with its emphasis on academic study , often produces graduates who have few or no practical skills , leaving them unprepared to deal with the realities of life .
By contrast , Jehovah’s servants choose education that helps them to develop the necessary skills so that they can maintain a simple life of service to God .
Then he added : “ On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse , that I may gain Christ . ”
Then there are specialized courses for single pioneer brothers ( Bible School for Single Brothers ) and married pioneer couples ( Bible School for Christian Couples ) .

Her parents , Roy and Ruth Howell , were raised as Bible Students , and her grandparents were also Bible Students and friends of Brother Charles Taze Russell .
On October 1 , 1950 , we began our pioneer service together . Then in 1952 , we were invited to do circuit work .
Both of us felt that we needed much help to carry out this new assignment .
While I learned from experienced brothers , I also sought help for Grace .
I approached Marvin Holien , a longtime family friend who had experience in serving as a traveling overseer , and I asked him : “ Grace is young and lacks experience .
Can you recommend someone she can work with for a while to get some training ? ”
We will never forget how inexperienced we felt in that assignment .
Keep up the good work . ”
Later , we went upstairs to our Bethel room .
Worn out from anxiety , we wept .
Keep up the good work ”
We were informed before going to school that our training was not necessarily to prepare us to become missionaries .
When we finished the course , we were assigned to serve in the district work .
Eventually , I worked as a secretary for Brother Knorr in the office that organized the worldwide preaching work .
Then he said kindly , “ Be of good courage ​ — you are doing well , and in time , you will be fine . ”
Up to this day , when we at times meet some of the brothers who were young men at Bethel during those years , they tell Grace with a smile , “ You really taught me how to make a bed , and I can tell you my mother liked what you did . ”
Caring for those different assignments helped her to appreciate that whatever we do or wherever we serve in Jehovah’s organization is a privilege and a blessing .
I’ll make some evening calls , but on Tuesday and Thursday evenings , I need to attend very important meetings . ”
The head nurse came to Grace and said : “ Mrs . Allen , go home and get some rest .
After surgery and a successful recovery , she was pronounced cancer free .

A month prior to the above assembly , the Jews had completed the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls .
The Israelites obediently followed what direction ?
On the very next day , the family heads gathered together to see how the nation could conform more closely to God’s Law .
In their study of the Scriptures , they found that the seventh month was to include the Festival of Booths with its concluding solemn assembly from the 15th through the 22nd day of Tishri , so they began to make preparations .
8 : 13 - 18 .
This was not a festival day of feasting .

What did the Levites ask of God , and what do we learn from this ?
( b ) To what two heavenly armies do the Levites evidently refer ?

This is beautifully demonstrated in God’s dealings with the descendants of Abraham when they were slaves to the Egyptians .
However , by a series of progressive actions , God caused his promise to come true , thereby proving himself worthy of the unique and illustrious name Jehovah .
“ Upon Mount Sinai , ” recall the Levites in their prayer to God , he “ came down and spoke with them out of heaven and went on to give them upright judicial decisions and laws of truth , good regulations and commandments . ”
The Levites ’ prayer refers to two specific sins committed by Israel soon after they had promised to keep God’s Law at Mount Sinai .
10 : 1 - 11 .
Sadly , after inheriting the Promised Land , the Israelites adopted the sensuous , murderous worship of Canaanite gods .
“ Time and again ” this happened .
( Read Nehemiah 9 : 26 - 28 , 31 . )
16 , 17 . ( a ) After the exile , how did the situation of the Israelites differ from when their forefathers first inherited the Promised Land ?
Were the Levites suggesting that God was unjust in allowing this distress ?
Certainly not !
With such wonderful prospects ahead of us , may we not stop praying for the sanctification of God’s glorious name .
“ Father , . . . glorify your son , that your son may glorify you . ” ​ — JOHN 17 : 1 .
To make sure that we do not forget this loving provision , Jesus instituted a new annual observance that replaced the Passover .
He did this by breaking a loaf of unleavened bread , and passing it to each of his 11 faithful apostles , he said : “ This means my body which is to be given in your behalf . Keep doing this in remembrance of me . ”
( a ) What big change followed Jesus ’ death ?
So , what does Jesus do ?
We are in a position to look back and ask , “ Has God answered Jesus ’ prayer ? ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) What do we learn from the introduction to Jesus ’ prayer ?
Thus , knowing God includes being obedient to him .
24 : 13 .
After reading Jesus ’ prayer recorded in John chapter 17 , who can doubt Jesus ’ deep love not only for his apostles there present but also for his future disciples ?
We can be sure that Jesus firmly rejected such an unscriptural tradition .
He said to his opposers : “ I have come in the name of my Father , but you do not receive me ; if someone else arrived in his own name , you would receive that one . ”
Then , a few days before his death , Jesus expressed his main concern in life by praying : “ Father , glorify your name . ”
Also , I am no longer in the world , but they are in the world and I am coming to you .
Holy Father , watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me , in order that they may be one just as we are . ” ​ — John 17 : 6 , 11 .
36 : 23 .
“ Just as you sent me forth into the world , ” prays Jesus , “ I also sent them forth into the world . ”
All credit for this must go to Jehovah , who made it possible by the operation of his powerful holy spirit . ​ — 1 Cor .
Sadly , this miraculous unity did not survive the death of the apostles .
( b ) What should we be determined to do ?
Who can deny that Jesus has acted in harmony with his prayer ?

A charming silent film entitled A Trip Down Market Street enthralls viewers with its revealing display of life as it was in San Francisco , U.S.A . , at the turn of the 20th century .
They go about their daily activities completely oblivious to the calamity that lies immediately ahead ​ — the destruction of this system of things and their way of life .
It is likely that you reserve some time each week to engage in the door - to - door ministry , but can you do more to warn others ?
Jesus ’ example is noteworthy in that he never considered himself to be off duty .
How is Jesus ’ sense of urgency being imitated today ?

Does Jehovah value what his worshippers do in trying to please him ? Some might say no , claiming that God is not interested in us .
But such a claim promotes a gross misrepresentation of God .
What kind of faith pleases Jehovah ?
A person with true faith is fully convinced that his efforts to live in a way that pleases God will not be in vain .
How could we please Jehovah if we doubted his ability or desire to reward us ?
Titus 1 - 3 ; Philemon 1 - 25 ; Hebrews 1 - 13 – James 1 - 5

Seven Shepherds , Eight Dukes ​ — What They Mean for Us Today
▪ “ Be Vigilant With a View to Prayers ”
As the end of Satan’s wicked system of things nears , it is imperative that we not fall asleep spiritually .
▪ Seven Shepherds , Eight Dukes ​ — What They Mean for Us Today
▪ Obey Jehovah’s Shepherds
Over 2.8 million commuters travel to Tokyo every day .
Efforts are being made to reach people missed in our house - to - house preaching work
4 : 7 .
Who benefit when you pray for others ?

Present - day Christians face a similar challenge because the long night of Satan’s wicked system of things is now at the darkest point in its history .
4 : 7 .
Because of where we are in the stream of time , it is wise to ask ourselves : ‘ How vigilant am I when it comes to prayer ?
In our prayers , we may often petition Jehovah for his help in satisfying our needs and in overcoming obstacles .
These include those of praise , thanksgiving , and supplication .
Why should we often praise Jehovah in our prayers ?
Why , the six verses of the 150th Psalm exhort us 13 different times to praise Jehovah !
How is a thankful spirit in prayer a protection ?
The world is indeed dominated by a spirit of ingratitude .
( Read Matthew 6 : 9 , 10 . )
This world is drenched in wickedness , and human governments are failing to care for even the basic needs of their citizens .
Surely , then , we should pray for our heavenly Father’s name to be sanctified and for his Kingdom to rid the earth of Satan’s rule .
This is also a time to supplicate Jehovah to have his will done on earth as it is in heaven .
Let us therefore remain vigilant , readily making use of all forms of prayer .
Although the apostle Peter exhorted Christians to “ be vigilant with a view to prayers , ” he himself failed to be that way on at least one occasion .
If we had been in the garden of Gethsemane that night , we too might have fallen asleep .
Rather than criticize the weary apostles , Jesus lovingly acknowledged that “ the spirit . . . is eager , but the flesh is weak . ”
( b ) How does Peter’s experience affect you ?
The experience in the garden of Gethsemane was not wasted on Peter . He learned a painful lesson from his lack of vigilance .
Earlier , Jesus had said : “ All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night . ”
Jesus responded by saying that Peter would disown him three times .
Overwhelmed by his final denial of Jesus , Peter “ wept bitterly . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 60 - 62 .
10 : 12 .
Jehovah answered his prayers and directed matters in a way that benefited His people .
13 , 14 .
Satan is merciless and often strikes us when we are weak .
Satan would have us believe that we are worthless .
We do well to ask ourselves : ‘ Do I pray hard for my brothers around the world ?
So we ought to take seriously our privilege and responsibility to pray in behalf of others .
Like Epaphras , we should display our heartfelt love and concern for our Christian brothers and sisters by exerting ourselves in prayer in their behalf .
We must not fall asleep spiritually , and we should never allow the world’s distractions to crowd out our time to be alone with Jehovah in prayer .
Instead , let us “ be vigilant with a view to prayers . ”
Doing so will help us to engage in “ holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion ” as we await the day of Jehovah .
Our way of life will thus reveal that we are staying awake spiritually and that we really believe that the end of this wicked system of things is imminent .
And what a blessing that will prove to be !
As a result , Jehovah saved his beloved Son out of death and rewarded him with immortal life in heaven .
Banks closed , and cash machines emptied or went off - line . ”

CHARITABLE PLANNING OFFICE
“ I will show a waiting attitude . ” ​ — MIC .
Satan knows that he has only “ a short period of time . ”
However , that “ period of time ” has gone on for decades , and some may feel that the last days have lasted a long time .
As we wait for Jehovah to act , have we personally become impatient ?
( 2 ) What events will signal the end of our waiting period ?
( 3 ) How can we express our appreciation for Jehovah’s patience ?
In Micah’s day , what were conditions like in Israel ?
What challenges do we face ?
Instead , may we remain loyal and wait patiently for Jehovah to resolve matters .
And Jehovah’s judgment message against Samaria through Micah was fulfilled when the Assyrians invaded the northern kingdom of Israel . ​ — Mic .
( b ) What will make time pass more quickly ?
During “ the final part of the days , ” millions from all nations and tribes and tongues have streamed to “ the mountain of the house of Jehovah . ”
Explain .
After the first world war , the League of Nations was formed in the hope of bringing peace .
What do we know about the declaration of “ Peace and security ” ?
Read Revelation 7 : 1 - 4 .
What will happen then ?
“ Peoples and crowds and nations and tongues ” will be unable to give her effective support .
In fact , a lack of support is now reflected in the news media , where religion and religious leaders are increasingly coming under attack .
18 : 8 , 10 .
( b ) Why is it urgent that inactive ones return to Jehovah ?
Obviously , Jehovah cares deeply about all those who have expressed love for his name , even if they are not actively serving him at present .
When we help such ones return to the congregation , we contribute to making Jehovah and the angels rejoice .
Now is the time to return to our heavenly Father’s loving arms and to the congregation ​ — the only safe haven in these last days . ​ — Deut .
Let us patiently wait for the proclamation of “ Peace and security ! ” and for the final sealing of the chosen ones .
Close ranks against the Devil and the demons !
When two pioneers were invited into a certain house in Kenya , they were surprised to see the slight figure of a man lying on a bed .
As they shared with him God’s promise that “ the lame one will climb up just as a stag does , ” the man responded with a wide smile . ​ — Isa .
The pioneers learned that Onesmus , now in his late 30 ’ s , was born with osteogenesis imperfecta , or brittle bone disease .
“ My constant pain seemed to diminish during the meetings , ” Onesmus recalls .
In time , he was baptized and now serves as a ministerial servant .
When he expressed his concern to his fellow Christians , they promised to support him .
Onesmus ’ desire to be a regular pioneer met with the same concern .

After meditating on that scripture , Onesmus decided to become a regular pioneer .
The king of Israel should have known better .
7 : 16 .
Explain how Isaiah 7 : 14 , 16 was fulfilled ( a ) in the eighth century B.C.E . ( b ) in the first century C.E .
At first , the Syro - Israelite alliance seemed to have the upper hand . In one battle alone , Ahaz lost 120,000 valiant fighting men !
There is no evidence that Jesus was ever addressed by the name Immanuel . ​ — Read Isaiah 7 : 14 ; 8 : 3 , 4 .
It was the rising world power of Assyria .
Therefore , Hezekiah met with them to assure them of his support .
Picture the faithful Levites who were present at that meeting , tears of joy streaming down their faces as they heard their king declare : “ You are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him . ”
What further steps did Hezekiah take to shore up the spirituality of the nation , and with what result ?
This spiritual cleansing would be of the utmost importance in view of what was to come .
True to Isaiah’s word , the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and deported its inhabitants , thus frustrating Israel’s plans to place a usurper on David’s throne .
One after another , Judah’s cities fell before the advancing Assyrian armies ! ​ — 2 Ki .
Of course , Hezekiah was aware of the approaching danger , but rather than desperately enlist the help of a pagan nation , as his apostate father , Ahaz , had done , Hezekiah placed his trust in Jehovah .

Explain .
What Hezekiah did next was of even greater value than stopping up the waters or fortifying the city walls .
Upon hearing this , the Jews “ began to brace themselves upon the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah . ”
Then Rabshakeh asserted that just as the gods of the nations had been unable to protect their worshippers , so Jehovah would be unable to deliver the Jews out of the Assyrians ’ clutches .
Hezekiah was understandably upset , but instead of turning to a foreign power for help , he sent for Isaiah the prophet .
Who today are represented by ( a ) Jerusalem’s citizens ( b ) “ the Assyrian ” ( c ) the seven shepherds and eight dukes ?
In the near future , Jehovah’s apparently vulnerable people will come under attack from the modern - day “ Assyrian , ” whose intent will be to wipe them out .
The Scriptures refer to that attack as well as the attack of ‘ Gog of Magog , ’ the attack of “ the king of the north , ” and the attack of “ the kings of the earth . ”
What ‘ secret weapon ’ does Micah’s prophecy indicate Jehovah would raise up against that implacable foe ​ — “ the Assyrian ” ?
A very unlikely one ​ — “ seven shepherds , yes , eight dukes ” !
Today , Jehovah certainly has provided an abundance of spiritual men to shepherd his precious sheep , to strengthen his people for the future attack of the modern - day “ Assyrian . ”
* Micah’s prophecy states that they will “ shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword . ”
How might reflecting on this account benefit us in the future ?
The time will come when God’s modern - day servants will appear to be just as vulnerable as the Jews trapped inside Jerusalem in Hezekiah’s day .
32 : 8 .
The Hebrew word translated “ maiden ” at Isaiah 7 : 14 can mean either a married woman or a virgin .
Why should the sheep listen to the undershepherds ?
We will also consider how the sheep should respond to Jehovah’s loving interest in them .
Jesus even ‘ surrendered his soul in behalf of the sheep . ’
What a blessing Christ’s ransom sacrifice is for mankind !
How do the sheep respond to the Fine Shepherd , Jesus Christ ?
“ My sheep listen to my voice , ” said Jesus , “ and I know them , and they follow me . ”
This includes cooperating with the spiritual undershepherds whom he has appointed .
The elders are ‘ watching over souls ’ in the sense that they desire to help each member of the congregation maintain a good relationship with Jehovah .
The apostle Peter warned of “ false prophets ” and “ false teachers ” who would try to “ entice unsteady souls ” into wrongdoing .
Through his organization , Jehovah provides an abundance of spiritual food to the whole association of brothers worldwide .
Much Scriptural counsel is provided by means of our publications .
In a spiritual sense , overseers have the responsibility of protecting , nursing , and caring for the health of members of the congregation , especially those who have hurt themselves or who have fallen sick spiritually .
Some of these individuals may have strayed from the flock and have stopped engaging in Christian activities .
18 : 12 - 14 .
True , the elders are imperfect . However , we need to have a proper view of their shortcomings and weaknesses .
The Scriptures candidly acknowledge the failings of those whom Jehovah used to lead his people in the past .
14 , 15 .
Obedience to those who today are taking the lead among us is vital .
To survive the tenth plague , the Israelites had to obey the instructions to have a special meal and to splash some of the blood of a slaughtered sheep on the doorposts and lintels of their houses .
In those circumstances , Moses and the older men acted as bearers of Jehovah’s instructions to his people .
Naturally , any elders today who are delegated the responsibility of representing Jehovah or his organization must be exceptionally careful never to abuse the authority entrusted to them .
In order to remain united and safe within the flock of God , we need to listen to ‘ a word behind us , ’ telling us which way to go .
Like a wild and ravenous predator , he is stalking the flock , waiting for an opportunity to pounce on the unwary or on those who stray .
The answer will be discussed in the following article .
How can elders imitate Jesus Christ ?
What is the objective of the elders ’ shepherding activity ?
SHEEP thrive when a shepherd takes a keen interest in the welfare of his flock .
23 : 4 .
The sheep in the flock they tend belong to Jehovah and to Jesus , who identified himself as “ the fine shepherd . ”
He loves the sheep so much that he willingly sacrificed his life for them .

Members of the congregation are urged to “ be obedient to those who are taking the lead ” among them .
As a shepherd is conscious of the particular needs of each sheep in his flock and stands ready to attend to them , Jehovah is aware of the needs of those in the congregation and is happy to provide the required care .
1 : 3 , 4 .
( a ) How were God’s sheep being treated in the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah ?

Consider the attitude of shepherds whom God condemned .
In the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah , Jehovah denounced those who should have been caring for his sheep but were not doing so properly .
Rather than feeding the sheep , those shepherds were exploiting them and “ feeding themselves . ”
By washing their feet , Jesus provided an object lesson in humility , a quality that Christian overseers need to display . ​ — Read John 13 : 12 - 15 ; 1 Pet .
The apostle Paul had that humble attitude , for he told the older men of the congregation in Ephesus : “ You well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia I was with you the whole time , slaving for the Lord with the greatest lowliness of mind . ”
He said : “ I have exhibited to you in all things that by thus laboring you must assist those who are weak . ”
Paul set a fine example of humility and hard work for elders today .
But he does so “ in a spirit of mildness . ”
13 , 14 .
Preaching the good news of the Kingdom was an important part of Jesus ’ earthly activity .
In our day , how encouraging it is for publishers to preach side by side with elders , to witness the elders ’ zeal for this lifesaving work , and to learn from their teaching methods !
Also , if he has committed sins , it will be forgiven him . ” Even if the spiritually ailing one does not “ call the older men , ” they should quickly come to his aid as soon as they become aware of his situation .
In all they do in Jehovah’s organization , Christian shepherds strive to imitate “ the great shepherd , ” Jesus Christ .
With the spiritual assistance of such responsible men , the flock benefits greatly and continues to flourish .
Among those Kingdom proclaimers were some one thousand colporteurs .
“ Noah had no boat - building experience , ” recalled Victor Blackwell , “ and I had no experience in or knowledge of building a house trailer . ”
The list read “ like an inventory from a country store . ”
There was much work to be done , and we intended to do it . ”
In those times , most pioneers did no secular work .

Bible Questions Answered 16
“ Are you good without God ?
Others see little practical value in religious teachings or , at any rate , fail to practice what their church preaches .
Clergymen of many denominations lament that their congregants behave like “ practical atheists . ”
It was first brought up in the opening pages of the Bible .
We see this in the fact that people want to belong to something or serve someone or some cause greater than themselves .
God did not design humans to live independently of him ; they have a need to communicate with their Maker .
Jesus , for example , stated : “ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . ”
From those words , we may conclude that an essential ingredient of a happy and contented life is satisfying our innate spiritual appetite .
Like a user’s manual , the Bible is a guide for life
To illustrate : When you buy a new piece of equipment , such as a camera or a computer , you expect it to come with an owner’s manual , or a handbook , that explains how to get the best use and satisfaction out of your acquisition .
The Bible can be likened to such a handbook .
Then your peace would become just like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea . ” ​ — Isaiah 48 : 17 , 18
O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments !

‘ Why are some innocent babies born deformed ? ’
By those words , Satan not only asserted that God is a liar but also implied that God’s way of governing is unjust .
How could those issues be resolved ?
God was in effect giving Satan and those who have taken his side the opportunity to demonstrate whether humans can live well without God .
Can humans live well and govern themselves successfully without God ?
Rather than showing God to be responsible for mankind’s woes , the Bible points to a major cause of them : “ Man has dominated man to his injury . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 8 : 9 .
What will God do ?
People have long yearned for freedom from sickness , aging , and death .
They have spent an enormous amount of time , effort , and resources in its pursuit , but to little or no avail .

The Bible tells us about God’s promise to restore the Paradise conditions lost by the first human couple .
It goes this way : “ Our Father in the heavens , let your name be sanctified .
* What must we do to benefit from God’s promise ?
For by him we have life and move and exist , even as certain ones of the poets among you have said , ‘ For we are also his progeny . ’ ” ​ — Acts 17 : 25 , 28 .
But why has God continued to make such provisions for all people , whether they give thought to him or not ?
Paul said that it is “ for them to seek God , if they might grope for him and really find him , although , in fact , he is not far off from each one of us . ” ​ — Acts 17 : 27 .
“ [ God ] will wipe out every tear from their eyes . ”
God’s promise refers to tears caused by suffering and sorrow .
Jehovah will release obedient humans from the grip of death .
Jehovah will lift obedient humans to perfection on the basis of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
* Then the last enemy , death , will be “ brought to nothing . ”
A life without tears , death , and pain will soon be a reality .
‘ Is God’s promise perhaps about life in heaven ? ’
First , the promise is introduced with the words “ the tent of God is with mankind , ” and mankind lives on earth .
Second , the promise describes a world where “ death will be no more ” ​ — a world where death once existed but will cease to exist .
Then he adds : “ These words are faithful and true . ”

Early in 1942 , shortly after the United States entered World War II , I was in my fifth year of college and was just months away from receiving my bachelor’s degree in architectural engineering .
I was living in a home with two roommates .
Impressed , I began to study the Bible with Johnny regularly and eventually to accompany him in his preaching work whenever I could .

Upon graduation I received an assignment to the Gold Coast , now known as Ghana .
In addition , I served as a traveling overseer in the nearby Ivory Coast , now known as Côte d’Ivoire .
So when opposers made trouble for us and secured an order to revoke our visas , wives of the officials put pressure on their husbands and the decision was reversed !
As did many missionaries in Africa , I eventually came down with malaria .

There they find “ Mary as well as Joseph , and the infant lying in the manger . ”
Are you happy to know these wonderful things ? — All of us who love God are .
To do that , we need to go back to the time before Mary was married .
So Jesus by then was no longer a baby in a manger ; he was a child living with Joseph and Mary in a house !
The Bible says that Herod wanted to find Jesus to kill him .
Today , Satan tries to make people think of Jesus only as a helpless baby .
That is what we should remember about Jesus , and we need to tell it to others .

3 Jehovah Shielded Them in the Shadows of the Mountains
People in Zimbabwe enjoy reading our literature .
She partially opens the package and quickly steps back and closes the door .
To transport precious Bible literature from where it was more readily available .
Ernst Wiesner , who was a circuit overseer in Germany at that time , described some of the security measures : “ Two brothers went ahead and whenever they met anyone , they at once signaled with their flashlights .
This was a sign for the brothers with their heavy knapsacks following about 100 meters [ 328 feet ] behind to hide in the bushes along the way until the two brothers ahead of them came back and gave a certain password , which was changed from week to week . ”
It was dark and foggy , and I was shivering as I walked in the freezing rain .
I got lost in the dwarf pines , and I could not find my way out for several hours .
In winter , they transported their precious loads using either skis or toboggans .
Some of them walked in front and threw their hats into the air when they suspected any danger .
There were arrangements for making sure that the literature was immediately distributed .
The packages were sent to different parts of Germany , where brothers and sisters discreetly delivered them to fellow believers as described at the outset .
The police used handwriting analysis to identify a key member of the smuggling group and arrested him .
Soon afterward , two more suspects , including Richard Rudolph , were arrested .
The publications brought in backpacks over the Giant Mountains represented an important supply of Bible literature for the German Witnesses .
But the Giant Mountains were not the only route used .
Most of us today can have Bible literature in needed quantity and various formats .
Whether you obtain a new publication at the Kingdom Hall or download it from the Web site jw.org , why not give thought to what was involved in making it available to you ?
The city of Hirschberg is now Jelenia Góra in southwestern Poland .
2 : 1 , 2 .
What timely warnings did Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians contain ?
HOAXES , scams , and deception are all too common in the present system of things .
As we approach the end of this wicked system , Satan’s anger grows because he has only “ a short period of time ” left .
Misleading statements and outright lies about Jehovah’s servants and their beliefs are sometimes featured in the media .
It is significant that we learn from the apostle Paul’s writings that some Christians in first - century Thessalonica had been misled , accepting what was untrue .
Thankfully , we have an increased understanding of the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose .
In this he called attention to the coming tribulation when the Lord Jesus will carry out divine judgment on “ those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news . ”
To set matters straight , Paul under inspiration explained that a great apostasy and “ the man of lawlessness ” were to appear before Jehovah’s day .
Those Ephesians ‘ put to the test ’ individuals who were in actuality false apostles , in fact , liars .
Why should we be on guard if someone begins to speculate or to speak critically ?
When writing to the Hebrews , Paul drew attention to two ways that a Christian might lose faith and fail to stand firm .
A boat that drifts away from the riverbank may do so imperceptibly at first . Gradually , the gap increases .
And what of today ?
What can we do to avoid thus being quickly shaken from our reason ?
One thing that we definitely need to do is remain aware of the time we are living in and the potential effect of association with those who refuse to acknowledge that these are “ the last days . ”
The foretold apostasy manifested itself long ago and persists to this day .
“ The man of lawlessness ” continues to exist and to oppose God’s servants .
Accordingly , we need to remain ever vigilant to the nearness of Jehovah’s day . ​ — Zeph .

Do not treat prophesyings with contempt . ”
What topics will most likely stimulate continued interest in those visited ?
Your participation will strengthen your faith and thus help you to avoid being shaken from your reason .
Yes , sharing in family worship will provide a safeguard against speculation and doubts .
What an incentive for them to maintain their power of reason !
How does each of these scriptures help you to evaluate the sacrifices you make for the Kingdom ?
What sort of sacrifices do many individuals make , and why ?
( b ) What additional sacrifices are some able to make ?
Certain sacrifices are fundamental for all true Christians and are essential to our cultivating and maintaining a good relationship with Jehovah .
To support Kingdom activities , many make sacrifices to serve at Bethel , to assist with building Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls , to organize conventions , or to do relief work in the wake of natural disasters .
It is a joy to see that many are willingly making sacrifices for Jehovah .
Some of these were required ; others were voluntary .
An outstanding example of offerings was seen in connection with the inauguration of the temple in Solomon’s day . ​ — 2 Chron .
Jehovah’s law stipulated that the blood of the animal be shed , which was to be “ a shadow of the good things to come ” through his Son , Jesus .
Second , the person giving the sacrifice had to be clean and undefiled .
If a person was in an unclean state , he would have to make a sin offering or a guilt offering to restore his standing with Jehovah before making a voluntary offering .
This was a serious matter .
( b ) What resources do we have at our disposal ?
Jehovah’s modern - day organization has always looked for opportunities to support Jehovah’s work .
One Bible scholar states : “ Salutations among the Orientals did not consist , as among us , of a slight bow , or extension of the hand , but [ were ] performed by many embraces , and inclinations , and even prostrations of the body on the ground .
All this required much time . ”
Our money .
magazines are printed . This is all supported by your voluntary donations .
Under inspiration , he encouraged his brothers in Corinth not to wait until the end of the week to see what was left over but , rather , to set aside funds at the start of the week in harmony with what they could do .
As in the first century , brothers and sisters in our time plan ahead to respond generously according to their circumstances .
He promises to help us when we tire out .
Jehovah encourages us to give our best and not hold back .
Can we ‘ set our heart on our ways ’ so as to have a greater share in the Kingdom work in these last days ?
Yet , even brothers with limited resources value the privilege of giving .
As was true of the ancient Israelites , we must make sure that our voluntary sacrifices are acceptable to God .
Otherwise , we would , in effect , be giving from what we do not have .

See the article “ Making Whole - Souled Sacrifices for Jehovah ” in the January 15 , 2012 , issue of The Watchtower , pages 21 - 25 .
WHEN you think of anniversaries , which one readily comes to your mind ?
For others , it might be the date of a widely celebrated historic event , such as when their homeland became independent .

Finally , God sent a tenth plague , the death of Egypt’s firstborn , which did move Pharaoh to release them . ​ — Ex .
The Israelites were to do what in preparation for being set free ?
As a statute to time indefinite you should celebrate it . ”
As Jews under the Mosaic Law , Jesus and his apostles shared in the annual Passover .
The Pentateuch and Haftorahs points out that Exodus 12 : 6 says that the lamb was to be slaughtered “ between the two evenings . ”
Professor Jonathan Klawans , a specialist in ancient Judaism , noted : “ The new day begins with the setting of the sun , so the sacrifice is made on the 14th but the beginning of Passover and the meal are actually on the 15th , although this sequence of dates is not specified in Exodus . ”
That night he was arrested and tried .
He proved this at the time he protected the Israelite firstborn “ when he plagued the Egyptians . ”
In discussing the Passover , what lessons will you help your children learn ?
True Christians do not memorialize the Jewish Passover .
But there is a better sacrifice that can preserve life permanently .
What of “ the Lamb of God ” who came to provide the ransom ?
This would hasten their death so that they would not be left on the stakes into Nisan 15 , a double Sabbath .
That matched what was done with the Passover lamb , so this lamb was in that sense “ a shadow ” of what was to come on Nisan 14 , 33 C.E .
Back in Egypt , the Israelites partook of the lamb’s flesh but not of its blood .
He said that those who would reign “ in the kingdom of God ” should partake of both the bread and the wine as symbols of his flesh and his blood .
So while the Passover was ‘ to be a memorial for ’ Jews , not Christians , we as Christians should know about it and take to heart some of the vivid lessons that it provides as part of ‘ all Scripture that is inspired of God . ’ ​ — 2 Tim .
Jewish commentator Marcus Kalisch ( 1828 - 1885 ) wrote : “ The same opinion has been more distinctly expressed by Ebn Ezra [ noted Spanish rabbi , 1092 - 1167 ] : ‘ We have two evenings ; the first , the setting of the sun . . . and the second , the ceasing of the light which is reflected in the clouds ; and between both lies an interval of about one hour and twenty minutes ; ’ and this explanation , which appears to be the most rational interpretation is also that of the Karaites and the Samaritans , and has been adopted by many others . ”

11 : 24 .
Basically , how is the date set for the Memorial ?
No matter what our hope is , why is it important to be present at the Memorial ?
1 , 2 .
Once the first day of the Jewish month Nisan was determined , the Passover would be held 13 days later , after sunset on Nisan 14 .
What particular items will be used ?
( Read Mark 14 : 12 - 16 . )
After finishing the Passover meal , Jesus focused on those two emblems .
What type of wine did Jesus speak of , and what sort of wine may be used today at the Memorial ?
As there was no need for augmenting or fortifying the value of Jesus ’ blood , the wine used is not a type fortified with brandy or spices .
Some churchgoers point out that Jesus literally said : ‘ This is my body , ’ so they believe that the bread miraculously became his actual flesh .
* Jesus ’ body was there in front of the faithful apostles , and so was the unleavened bread they would partake of .
2 : 21 - 24 ; 4 : 1 ; John 19 : 33 - 36 ; Heb .
What did Jesus say that the wine meant or represented ?
His shed blood .
Yes , Jesus ’ blood would be “ poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins . ”
During the Memorial talk , what hopes are discussed ?
One is the hope of reigning with Christ in heaven , the hope entertained by a relatively small number of Christ’s followers , such as the faithful apostles .
They have the prospect of living forever on earth in a restored paradise .
And the Scriptures give delightful indications of the marvelous conditions that they will be able to experience endlessly . ​ — Isa .
For example , in Matthew’s account we read : “ Jesus took a loaf and , after saying a blessing , he broke it and , giving it to the disciples , he said : ‘ Take , eat .
This means my body . ’ ”
Few ( or perhaps no one ) will partake of the bread , as was the case in most congregations when the bread was passed on this occasion in 2013 .
4 : 18 ) All others present will be respectful observers .
Still , being at the Lord’s Evening Meal is important , for being there shows how highly they value Jesus ’ sacrifice .
They have the prospect of being among the “ great crowd ” who survive the coming “ great tribulation . ”
We will have arranged our personal affairs to be sure to be present .
11 : 24 .
Both are to carry out their roles as “ one flesh . ”
During her marriage of 58 years , Daniella knew many who lost their mates .
There is no way to comprehend it until you go through it . ”
After his dear wife Rachel died , Jacob did not soon forget her .
44 : 27 ; 48 : 7 .
What lesson should we learn from these Scriptural examples ?

Widows and widowers often feel the pain of loss for years .
However , I realize that this is normal and that the passing of time will eventually reduce some of the pain . ”
How was he able to do it ?
Charles was not overwhelmed by grief . His pain did not just disappear overnight , but neither did it consume him .
On the contrary , it is part of “ the works of the Devil . ”
Might the younger generations have to learn to view their ancestors in a way far different from the way they view them today ?
At this point , we must trust in God .
On the other hand , we cannot even conceive of the happiness that the resurrected ones will feel .
The Bible answers no .
That includes the complete removal of the distressing effect of death , for the prophecy goes on to say : “ The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces . ”
If you feel sadness now because your partner in life has died , the resurrection will certainly give you reason for happiness .
Jehovah says : “ As the heavens are higher than the earth , so my ways are higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts . ”
We cannot know exactly how Jehovah will satisfy all our needs and desires , yet we should not doubt that he will do so .
He will satisfy “ the desire of every living thing . ” ​ — Ps .
Trust in Jehovah’s promise of a future filled with joy Near the time of Jesus ’ death , his apostles became distraught .
Jesus consoled them with these words : “ Do not let your hearts be troubled . Exercise faith in God , exercise faith also in me . ”

For a while after a married Christian dies , many may come to the home of the surviving mate to offer comfort and to help in various ways .
For example , a widow will likely appreciate the attention of family and friends .
How should you greet a person in mourning ?
may not be the best . The grieving one may think , ‘ You have no idea how I feel ’ or , ‘ How can I be all right at this time ? ’
Thus , it may be more helpful to make a sincere , positive statement , such as “ I am so happy to see you , ” or “ Seeing you in the congregation encourages me . ”
What did they talk about ?
Do not judge .
Do not feel hurt if that one needs to be alone .
Keep showing love . ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
That faithful man was not disappointed . ​ — Gen .
15 : 2 - 5 ; Heb .
6 : 10 - 15 .
Yet , Jehovah reserved a blessing for faithful Jacob , something beyond what he could imagine .
What lessons can we learn from these accounts ?
Paul wrote : “ To the one who can , according to his power which is operating in us , do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive , to him be the glory by means of the congregation and by means of Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever .
3 : 20 , 21 .
What are three challenges to making a second marriage work ?
They are : not letting an earlier marriage overshadow your current marriage ; interacting with old friends who are unfamiliar with your new spouse ; trusting your new mate even though your first spouse may have been disloyal . ​ — 7 / 1 , pages 9 - 10 .

The Sting of Death 3

OTHER BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED ​ — What Is the Will of God for My Life ?
Death is an uncomfortable subject .
Whatever the case , the pain of death cannot be eluded , and its finality can be devastating .
Antonio , who lost his father in a road accident , explains : “ It is like somebody sealing up your house and taking away the keys .
When faced with a similar loss , Dorothy , who became a widow at the age of 47 , resolved to find some answers .
“ No one really knows , ” he replied .
EMPEROR QIN SHI HUANG
We fight it with all our might .
Or , in the exuberance of youth , we may imagine that the enemy will never come to claim us ​ — a delusion we cling to as long as we can .
They spent much of their own lives ​ — as well as the lives of thousands of workers ​ — in an attempt to conquer death .
But many of their concoctions contained toxic mercury , and one of their mixtures likely killed him .
He discovered Florida , U.S.A . , in the process but died a few years later after a skirmish with Native Americans .
Why do we rebel against death ?
Why did God put “ eternity ” in our hearts ?
On the contrary , God promises us that there will come a victory over death .
So the battle against death is not a hopeless one .
Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible .
“ The last enemy , death , is to be brought to nothing . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 .
But Jesus ’ disciples did not grasp his meaning , so Jesus told them plainly : “ Lazarus has died . ” ​ — John 11 : 14 .
Four days after the burial , Jesus arrived at Bethany and sought to comfort Martha , a sister of the deceased .
To demonstrate that those words were not an empty promise , Jesus then approached the tomb and cried out : “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
On one occasion he raised a young girl from the dead ​ — the daughter of Jairus .
Jesus ’ early disciples clearly understood the true condition of the dead .
Death thereby loses its mystery and no longer needs to cause us dread .
What hope do we have that the dead who lie asleep in the grave will return to life ​ — as Lazarus and Jairus ’ daughter did ?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ Christ has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 20 .
“ We do not want you to be ignorant about those who are sleeping in death , so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 13 .
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
Michelle : The last time I was here , we discussed how God feels about our suffering .
Michelle : I’m glad to hear that .
Sophia : It is .
Sophia : That was a new thought to me .
Sophia : That’s what I don’t understand .
Why does God let all these bad things happen when he has the power to stop them ?
Sophia : Yes , I learned that story in Sunday school .
God said not to eat from a certain tree , but they went ahead and ate from it anyway .
“ Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made .
At this the woman said to the serpent : ‘ We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden . But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden : “ You must not eat from it , no , you must not touch it ; otherwise you will die . ” ’
Let’s examine these verses for a moment .
Michelle : Yes , exactly .
Maybe we would choose a heavy object and then see which one of us was able to lift it .
That’s a different matter , isn’t it ?
Sophia : Yes , I suppose so .
Sophia : No .
Michelle : And that too was a major challenge .
So God has allowed Satan to rule this world for a time .
David experienced a lot of suffering during his lifetime , but notice what he was able to say in prayer to God .
Would you please read that verse ? Sophia : OK .
It says : “ I will rejoice greatly in your loyal love , for you have seen my affliction ; you are aware of my deep distress . ”
May I come back next week and show you why we can be sure that God will soon end all suffering ?

Luke wrote the Gospel that bears his name as well as the Acts of Apostles .
Luke’s correct use of titles is noteworthy because when the status of a Roman territory changed , so did the title of its administrator .
Scholar William Ramsay calls Luke “ a historian of the highest order . ”
Do you believe in the Bible’s promise of a resurrection ?
But is it realistic to nourish such a hope ?
Let us look further at what happened .
Imagine her surprise when after hearing Jesus say , “ I am the resurrection and the life , ” she saw Jesus raise her brother from the dead ! ​ — John 11 : 23 - 25 .
Lazarus said nothing to suggest that he had been alive somewhere else during those four days .
What a marvelous gift Jesus gave to that family !
* During his rule over the earth , the heavenly Jesus will bring back to life those humans who are asleep in mankind’s common grave .
“ The one who exercises faith in me , even though he dies , will come to life . ” ​ — John 11 : 25
After making those remarkable statements about the resurrection , Jesus asked Martha a soul - searching question : “ ‘ Do you believe this ? ’
Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to show you what the Bible teaches about this subject ?

“ Let Your Kingdom Come ” ​ — But When ?
▪ Serving Jehovah Before the Days of Distress Come
In these articles , we will discuss principles that can guide young Christians to serve God fully , as well as opportunities that older Christians have to expand their ministry .

Being an amateur boxer , he wondered , ‘ Where can I get a chance to become a sports star and become rich ? ’
But having no travel documents , he would have to enter Europe illegally .
Now the really risky part of the journey was about to begin .
* What motivated them to make such a big move , and how did it turn out for them ?
Initially , they greatly missed family and friends in France , and the couple feared that they would not be able to adapt to their new life .
How has the move affected their marriage ?
Eric and his wife , Katy , serve as pioneers in sparsely populated northern Benin .
Some ten years ago , while living in France , they began reading articles about serving where there is a greater need and talking to full - time servants .
Benjamin recalls : “ When I told the missionary that I wanted to pioneer , he said : ‘ You know , you could pioneer in Togo . ’ ”
That made it easier for me to go there . ”
Explains Benjamin : “ I didn’t know one word of French .
The first six months were tough because I couldn’t really communicate . ”
Eric and Katy , mentioned earlier , served in a foreign - language field in France before moving to Benin .
Adds Eric : “ Loud music blared in the neighborhood until late at night .
You have to be patient with things like that and be willing to adapt . ”
Says Michel : “ Some compared our move to a tightrope walker pushing a wheelbarrow ​ — and we were sitting in the wheelbarrow !
Those with experience as “ need greaters ” stress the importance of preparing oneself by taking these steps : Plan ahead .
Sébastien , mentioned earlier , relates : “ Before moving , Johanna and I saved for two years by cutting down on expenses for entertainment and not making unnecessary purchases . ”
Before long , she knew that this was the kind of life she really wanted to pursue .
Says Marie - Thérèse : “ After returning to France , I talked to my employer about my desire to adjust my work schedule , and he was willing to change it .
In 2011 she was back in France to earn enough money to be able to support herself for another year ( her sixth ) in Africa .
Saphira relates : “ It was a Friday , my last day on the job , but I still needed another ten days of work to earn enough for the coming year .
I had only two more weeks left in France .
I prayed to Jehovah , explaining my situation . Shortly thereafter , an employment agency phoned me and asked if I could replace someone for two weeks . ”
On Monday , Saphira went to the job location to be trained by the worker she was to replace .
Her boss had refused to give her a leave unless a replacement could be found .
Pascal , a pioneer and Christian elder from France , has served in Benin for over 12 years .
Many streets have no names , and the houses have no numbers .
Some publishers made no notes and thus failed to make all their return visits .
They made rapid progress and were soon appointed as ministerial servants . ”
1 : 17 .
KING SOBHUZA II of Swaziland ruled for nearly 61 years .
In fact , the Bible refers to him as “ the King of eternity . ”
Then he gave this couple the opportunity to fill the earth with their children .
Life apart from God’s rule brought pain , suffering , and death to them and their offspring .
He exercised his authority by driving the man and woman out of the garden of Eden , and to prevent their return , he assigned cherubs to stand guard at the entrance .
He promised an “ offspring ” who would bring an end to Satan and undo the effects of Adam’s sin . ​ — Read Genesis 3 : 15 .
7 , 8 . ( a ) How bad had conditions become by the time of Noah ?
However , the majority of humans rejected Jehovah as their Father and King .
Noah’s message no doubt included a call for repentance and warnings of impending destruction , but it fell on deaf ears .
By bringing a global Flood , Jehovah exercised dominion over the rebellious humans and wicked angels .
What action would the King of eternity take toward this rebel king and his efforts to thwart God’s purpose to “ fill the earth ” ?
God confused the people’s language , causing Nimrod’s frustrated subjects to be scattered “ over the entire face of the earth . ”
11 : 1 - 9 .
God repeated to Abraham’s son Isaac and grandson Jacob his promise to bless them , which would include producing kings from their descendants .
13 , 14 . ( a ) In song , what did the Israelites proclaim about Jehovah’s kingship ?
One might wonder , ‘ Since Jehovah is the King of eternity , how is it that he became King at that time ? ’
Before David died , Jehovah promised him that his kingship would continue indefinitely : “ I will raise up your offspring after you , your own son , and I will firmly establish his kingdom . ”
Whom did this prove to be , and when would he become King ?
He even taught his followers to pray for that Kingdom to come .
As King - Designate , Jesus could declare to his opposers : “ The Kingdom of God is in your midst . ”
On the third day , he resurrected his Son , and on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E . , Jesus established a spiritual kingdom over the Christian congregation of his anointed brothers .
110 : 1 .
What are we moved to do , and what will we learn in the next article ?
But now we may ask : How has Jehovah become King in our day ?
What does it mean when we pray for God’s Kingdom to come ?
These questions will be answered in the next article .
How did Jehovah become King in 1914 , and what were some of the Kingdom’s early accomplishments ?
1 , 2 .
Jehovah will use the Kingdom to unify his family in heaven and on earth .
In fact , Jehovah has already become King in our day !
And yet , Jehovah’s becoming King is not the same as the coming of God’s Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray .
As one writer states : “ The world of 1914 was full of hope and promise . ”
Next , the King turned his attention to his earthly subjects to refine , educate , and organize them to do God’s will .
Are you taking full advantage of these provisions ?
When Jesus began his ministry on earth , he announced : “ I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities , because for this I was sent . ”
For three and a half years , Jesus made this work the focal point of his life .
28 : 19 , 20 .
By 1919 , the “ good news of the Kingdom ” had taken on added meaning .
Two thousand delegates responded by sharing in a special “ Service Day , ” visiting homes up to 45 miles ( 72 km ) away from the convention site .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What arrangements have been made to train Kingdom proclaimers ?
( b ) How have you personally benefited from this training ?
Through the Christian congregation , Jesus is training his subjects for the ministry .
Jehovah has seated his Son “ far above every government and authority and power and lordship . ”
* The good news is being preached , and millions of honesthearted ones are being taught Jehovah’s ways .
He has cleansed a people for Jehovah’s name .
When we pray for God’s Kingdom to come , we are asking God that the Messianic King and his associate rulers come to put an end to human rulership and remove the earthly opposers of the Kingdom .
This action will fulfill the words of Daniel 2 : 44 that God’s Kingdom “ will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms . ”
Our yeartext for 2014 : “ Let your Kingdom come . ” ​ — Matthew 6 : 10
15 , 16 . ( a ) What thrilling events will take place during the Thousand Year Reign ?
After the Messianic King destroys God’s enemies , he will throw Satan and his demons into an abyss for a thousand years .
By the end of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign , the Messianic Kingdom will have achieved its purpose .
See the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ? pages 88 - 92 .
What is the most important choice you can make in life , and when can you make it ?
When is the best time to make that choice ?
Your decision to serve God with all your heart is the most important choice you will ever make .
( Compare Luke 14 : 16 - 20 . )
Illustrate how making the right choices can lead to fine experiences later .
Once you have chosen to serve God , you can contemplate what he wants you to do , and you can decide how you will serve him .
“ I decided to start making choices that would one day enable me to serve Jehovah overseas , ” continues Yuichiro .
I returned to Japan to make my plans .
Let us consider three basic Bible principles that can help you to make wise choices that will affect your future in a beneficial way .
( b ) ‘ Seeking first the Kingdom ’ creates what opportunities ?
He does not say how much of your youth you should devote to preaching about the Kingdom .
But Jesus did give us the helpful principle to seek the Kingdom first .
He was a very happy person because he did his Father’s will rather than his own .
27 : 11 .
Why did Baruch lose his joy , and what counsel did Jehovah give him ?
Jehovah told him : “ You are seeking great things for yourself .
What choice led Ramiro to enjoy a happy life ?
One brother who found happiness in serving others is Ramiro .
Youth is a fine time to start serving Jehovah fully .
Or perhaps you see ways to serve more fully in your present congregation .
How much training will you need ?
Information from secular sources can be helpful ​ — but beware . People who do not love Jehovah may try to plant love for the world in your heart .
What a blessing you have if your parents love Jehovah !
Also , the elders in your congregation are spiritually qualified men who can guide you .
How did they get started pioneering , and how do they provide for themselves ?
For example , suppose you want to drop out of high school and start pioneering mainly because you do not like the hard work that school requires .
A person who loves you may discern your motives and help you to realize that school can help you to learn not to give up easily , a vital quality if you want to serve Jehovah fully . ​ — Ps .
What decisions must we avoid ?
It would certainly be wise to avoid making decisions that endanger your relationship with God . ​ — Prov .
If anyone does not yet feel inclined to serve Jehovah , what should he do ?
At any rate , to the extent we have made progress , let us go on walking orderly in this same course . ”
Better than anyone , Jehovah can help you to make wise choices during your youth .
What Biblical examples of serving where the need is greater can benefit older Christians today ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What counsel was Solomon inspired to write to young people ?
Solomon used intriguing poetic language to describe the calamitous days of old age ​ — trembling hands , unsteady legs , loss of teeth , dim vision , poor hearing , white hair , and a bent frame .
What is involved in remembering our Grand Creator ?
Even though we may have been serving Jehovah for many years , it is good for us to stop occasionally and think appreciatively about how grand our Creator is .
Is not life awe - inspiring ?
12 : 13 .
You can pass on to younger ones what you have learned from Jehovah .
King David prayed for opportunities to do so .
He wrote : “ O God , you have taught me from my youth . . .
How can older Christians pass on to others what they have learned ?
Elihu of ancient times said : “ Let age speak , and let a multitude of years declare wisdom . ”
Consider what you understand now that you did not know 30 or 40 years ago .
If you are an elder , you know how to help brothers who take a false step .
Even if you have only recently learned the truth , you have valuable experience in life .
God’s Word says : “ The glory of young men is their strength , and the splendor of old men is their gray hair . ” ​ — Prov .
The brothers in that large city would no doubt have valued his continued support .
15 : 24 , 28 .
Relate an experience about someone who later in life moved to serve where the need is greater .
Everything was so different from what we were accustomed to in North America .
Can you imagine our joy at seeing the family’s progress and the eldest boy even taking up the pioneer service ? ”
Also , such territory can be very enjoyable to work .
“ About the time a fifth Chinese researcher asked for a Bible study , I thought , ‘ Just because I am 65 does not mean that I should retire from Jehovah’s service . ’
You may not be too old to expand your ministry ( See paragraphs 12 , 13 )
About what can older Christians be happy , and how is Paul’s example encouraging to them ?
So rather than be frustrated by what you cannot do , enjoy what you can do .
For years , he was under house arrest , unable to continue his missionary travels .
Although Solomon pointed out that the distressing days of frail health are not the best stage of life , Jehovah values what elderly Christians can accomplish in praising him .
She was an 84 - year - old widow when Jesus was born .
As the priest offered incense in the temple each morning and evening , Anna would be with the assembled crowd in the courtyard offering silent prayer for perhaps half an hour .
In some places , congregations lovingly arrange for such elderly ones to listen to the meetings by telephone .
Even so , Christians who cannot attend meetings can share in supporting true worship .
For example , although Anna was faithful all those years at the temple , she probably did not realize that centuries later her example would still encourage others .
No wonder God’s Word says : “ Gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness ” ! ​ — Prov .
But let those of us who still have some strength and vigor take to heart the inspired words : “ Remember . . . your Grand Creator . . . before the days of distress come . ” ​ — Eccl .
What is the significance of human society’s going from bad to worse ?
AS YOU may have noted , eyewitnesses of an event often remember the details quite differently .
Many people today experience a similar form of blindness when it comes to world events .
Clearly , that includes the end of the present wicked system .
Only when that occurs can God’s will be done on earth as it is being done in heaven .
Even if you have become a Witness more recently , on what is your attention focused ?

He immediately went forth to complete the conquest of Satan’s wicked system .
The descriptive prophecy in Revelation chapter 6 gave reason to expect that after God’s Kingdom was established , there would be a rapid deterioration of world conditions ​ — war , food shortage , pestilence , and other causes of death .
6 : 3 - 8 .
As foretold , peace was ‘ taken away from the earth , ’ despite human promises of international cooperation and diplomacy .
World War I can be viewed as just the beginning of significant wars , as is proved by recent world developments .
And despite many economic and scientific advances since 1914 , food shortages continue to threaten world security .
Furthermore , who can deny that all kinds of pestilences , natural disasters , and other ‘ deadly plagues ’ continue to cut down millions of victims each year ?
Many people were distracted by the outbreak of World War I and the Spanish influenza .
They were not completely sure about what would happen . Still , they knew that 1914 would mark a turning point regarding divine rulership .
That such occurred in many nations was itself a further fulfillment of prophecy .
With so much evidence that God’s Kingdom is already established in heaven , why do the majority of people not accept what this means ?
It takes faith and spiritual perception to see what is happening in the spirit realm .
Extreme violence and immorality are now commonplace .
A group of intoxicated teens brutally murder a nine - year - old girl and beat up her father and cousin .
4 : 7 - 10 .
Never before in history , though , has the overall morality of the entire world deteriorated to the extent that it has now .
For example , prior to the establishment of God’s Kingdom in heaven , a group of faithful anointed ones were actively serving God .
Over the years , most ​ — if not all — ​ of those anointed ones have faithfully completed their earthly course .
In his detailed prophecy about the conclusion of this system of things , Jesus said : “ This generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen . ”
The first group was on hand in 1914 , and they readily discerned the sign of Christ’s presence in that year .
Those who made up this group were not merely alive in 1914 , but they were spirit - anointed as sons of God in or before that year . ​ — Rom .
8 : 14 - 17 .
( Read Romans 13 : 11 . )
By our consciously focusing attention now on the unfolding fulfillment of Bible prophecy in these exciting times , we will not be distracted by the noise from Satan’s world ; nor will we be blind to the real meaning of world events .
As a young boy
I was only ten years old in 1985 when children from Cambodia arrived at my school in Columbus , Ohio , U.S.A .
Twice I decided to give up , but Jehovah encouraged me through my parents .
I also volunteered to tutor students who were learning English as a second language ​ — a choice that greatly benefited me later .
I visited there and learned to read Cambodian .
It was still a dangerous place , but I knew that few of the ten million people living in Cambodia had heard the good news of the Kingdom .
At that time , there was just one congregation of 13 publishers in the whole country .
I first visited Cambodia when I was 19 .
Two years later , I chose to go and live there . I found part - time work translating and teaching English to support me in my ministry .
Jehovah has granted me ‘ the desires of my heart . ’
As told by Ivars Vigulis
HISTORY : RISK - TAKING MOTORBIKE RACER
With so many things in the house that could be taken apart , she was always worried about leaving me home alone .
Later on , the Witnesses invited me to sit in on Evija’s Bible study and listen .
One thing that especially touched my heart was the Bible’s promise of a paradise earth .
As I continued to study the Bible , I learned how highly Jehovah values life and how precious it is to him .
That had an impact on my racing ​ — I no longer wanted to risk my life .
Instead , I wanted to use my life to give glory to Jehovah .
I now understood that the Witnesses really live by the high standards of the Bible .
It makes me really happy to put the skills that I learned as a child to good use !
OUR READERS ASK . . .
“ God . . . cannot lie . ” ​ — Titus 1 : 2
Well , in the very beginning , God warned mankind that rebellion against him would bring a grim result ​ — death .
Wicked kings , such as Ahab , were far more tyrannical .
“ Man has dominated man to his harm . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 8 : 9
And if God prevented all forms of oppression for everyone , would he not be responsible for an even greater falsehood ?
We need the Kingdom of God to come ; only then will injustice end .

26 Questions From Readers

“ In your splendor go on to victory . ” ​ — PS .
The 45th Psalm , though , is much more than an exciting story with a happy ending .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What is “ something good ” that concerns us , and how can it affect our heart ?
The Kingdom message became especially “ good ” in 1914 .
Since then , the message no longer concerns a future Kingdom but has to do with a real government now functioning in the heavens .
This is the “ good news of the Kingdom ” that we preach “ in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ”
Like the psalmist , our “ song is about a king ” ​ — our King Jesus Christ .
Moreover , we invite all ​ — the rulers and the ruled — ​ to submit to his kingship .
As a perfect man , doubtless he was “ handsome . ”
However , his outstanding handsomeness came from his faithfulness to Jehovah and his unbending integrity .
Because of Jesus ’ wholehearted devotion , Jehovah blessed him during his ministry on earth and rewarded him after his sacrificial death .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ When he [ Jesus ] came as a man , he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death , yes , death on a torture stake .
Jehovah installed his Son as his Messianic King in the heavens in 1914 .
( b ) How will Christ yet use his sword ?
Read Psalm 45 : 3 .
Because Christ is an invincible Warrior - King , he is addressed as “ O mighty one . ”
He strapped on his sword in 1914 and was victorious over Satan and his demons , whom he hurled out of heaven to the vicinity of the earth . ​ — Rev .
It is Jehovah’s purpose to use the political rulers to destroy this wicked “ prostitute . ”
Let us see how Psalm 45 prophesied these exciting events .
In what way does the King ride ‘ in the cause of humility ’ ?
All loyal subjects of the King must follow his example and humbly submit to Jehovah’s sovereignty in all things .
Only those who do so will be allowed to live in God’s promised new world . ​ — Zech .
11 : 1 - 5 .
As he rides forth , the King has a sword strapped on his side .
Announcing the King’s coming “ with power and great glory ” to execute judgment , the book of Revelation states : “ I saw heaven opened , and look ! a white horse .
And the one seated on it is called Faithful and True , and he judges and carries on war in righteousness .
Also , the armies in heaven were following him on white horses , and they were clothed in white , clean , fine linen .
Who will be Christ’s fellow warriors making up the heavenly “ armies ” that follow him into battle ?
So Christ’s heavenly armies will also include his anointed brothers , who by then will have received their heavenly reward .
The anointed corulers will be at his side when he accomplishes “ awe - inspiring things ” while shepherding the nations with an iron rod .
( b ) What do the sword and the bow stand for ?
Read Psalm 45 : 5 .
Both the sword and the bow represent the means that Christ will use to execute judgment on his enemies .
After destroying Satan’s wicked system of things on earth , Christ ‘ in his splendor ’ will “ go on to victory . ”
With the Devil and his angels then in a state of deathlike inactivity , earth’s inhabitants will be free of satanic influence and will be able to live in total subjection to their victorious and glorious King .
Before they see the earth gradually transformed into a global paradise , however , they will have another reason to rejoice with their King and his heavenly associates .
That joyful event will be examined in the following article .
19 : 7 .
This marriage will cause joy in heaven , but will those who hope to live forever on earth join in that rejoicing ?
These 144,000 spirit - anointed Christians “ keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes . ”
( b ) How does the bride view her future Bridegroom ?
His bride must also be fittingly attired for the occasion .
Indeed , “ her clothing is adorned with gold , ” and “ she will be brought to the king in richly woven garments . ”
19 : 8 .
We can therefore conclude that the order of events will be as follows : First , judgment will be executed upon “ the great prostitute , ” Babylon the Great , the world empire of false religion .
However , rejoicing over the marriage of the Lamb will not be limited to the Bridegroom and his bride .
These “ virgin companions ” of the bride have dedicated themselves to Jehovah and have proved themselves to be faithful subjects of the Bridegroom - King .
Appropriately , the book of Revelation represents the members of the “ great crowd ” as “ standing before the throne and before the Lamb . ”
The marriage of the Lamb brings joy to “ the virgin companions ” of the bride ( See paragraph 16 )
Doubtless , Christ will appoint others from among faithful elders of today to take the lead in the new world . ​ — Isa .
The remaining anointed on earth are enthralled by the prospect of soon being united in heaven with their brothers and with their Bridegroom .
A POOR widow hugs her boy , her only child .
She cannot believe her eyes .
Just a short time earlier , she had cradled his lifeless body in her arms in a tender embrace .
You can read about it in 1 Kings chapter 17 .
After Elijah announced the drought , God hid him from Ahab and miraculously fed the prophet with bread and meat brought to him by ravens .
“ Please , ” he said , “ bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink . ”
“ As surely as Jehovah your God is living , ” she replied , “ I have no bread , only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar . Now I am gathering a few pieces of wood , and I will go in and make something for me and my son .
Very likely , Zarephath was inhabited by Baal worshippers .
How many people who live in your territory are like the widow of Zarephath ?
Although they may be surrounded by adherents of false religion , they may yearn for something better .
Consider carefully what Elijah asked the widow to do .
But first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there , and bring it out to me .
What a momentous test of faith that was ​ — and what a wise decision she made !
In 1898 , Zion’s Watch Tower drew this lesson from the widow’s story : “ If the woman had the faith necessary to obey , then she would be esteemed worthy of the Lord’s assistance through the Prophet ; if she did not exercise the faith , another widow might have been found who would .
If we exercise the faith we will get the blessing ; if we do not , we will lose it . ”
We will indeed be blessed if we act in harmony with this wise proverb : “ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart , and do not rely on your own understanding . In all your ways take notice of him , and he will make your paths straight . ” ​ — Prov .
Searching for a reason for this tragedy , the grieving mother said to Elijah : “ What do you have against me , O man of the true God ?
What do those bitter words mean ?
The Bible does not tell us , but one point is clear : The widow did not accuse God of any unrighteousness .
Jehovah was listening .
The account in 1 Kings chapter 17 says no more about this woman .
“ Because he has affection for me , I will rescue him .
1 , 2 .
Still others do not even know who their parents are .
Or you may be one of the thousands who have come to learn the truth through the preaching activity of other servants of Jehovah . ​ — Rom .
What do all of us have in common ?
6 : 9 .
As we examine the depth of our appreciation for our Father , Jehovah , what will it be helpful to consider ?
But how is this possible in view of the tragic consequences of Adam’s disobedience ?
How did Jehovah prove to be the Grand Provider in the time of Abraham and Isaac ?
( See opening image . )
In the 19th century B.C.E . , a prophetic event unfolded that reveals the extent of Jehovah’s loving provision for obedient humans to enjoy everlasting life .
No wonder that place came to be called “ Jehovah - jireh , ” which means “ Jehovah Will Provide . ” ​ — Gen . 22 : 14 ; ftn .
As we meditate on how Jehovah proves to be the Grand Provider , we gratefully acknowledge the vital role played by Jesus Christ , even as Paul did when he wrote : “ This is what we have concluded , that one man died for all ; so , then , all had died .
5 : 14 , 15 .
Today , anointed servants of Jehovah perform the same ministry .
Illustrate how a loving father seeks to protect his child .
A loving father not only provides for his children but also seeks to protect them .
He and his father were returning home from the field service when their path took them across a stream .
Going ahead of his father , the boy lost his footing on one of the stones , tumbled into the flooding water , and went under twice .
What protection has God provided for his servants in our time ?
Like the Israelites at Rephidim , we look to God for safety when confronted by enemies .
91 : 2 .
Jehovah can use our fellow believers to help us stay faithful in difficult times ( See paragraphs 18 - 20 )
For instance , we receive fatherly counsel to avoid bad associations through the misuse of social networking .
What protection and guidance are available through the Christian congregation ?
By carefully heeding his commands .
( a ) We should be determined to do what ?
For his obedience even to the point of death , Jesus received a rich reward .
So may we always look to Jehovah as the Provider and Protector beyond compare .
What a joy and great privilege it is to serve him !
Our love for him will grow as we reflect on the third aspect of our Father’s care for us ​ — his friendship .
The next article focuses on how Jehovah is our best Friend .
“ [ Abraham ] came to be called Jehovah’s friend . ” ​ — JAS .
What will help us to open our hearts to our best Friend ?
Having been created in God’s image , we possess what ability ?
“ LIKE father , like son ” is an oft - repeated phrase .
Indeed , many children closely resemble their parents .
Being created in his image , we have the ability to reason and draw conclusions and develop and maintain friendships . ​ — Gen .
As regards friendship with Jehovah , contrast Abraham with his descendants .
What was the basis for that faithful man’s enduring friendship with his Creator ?
Why ?
Let us now consider his fine example and take it to heart .
But did that encounter erect a barrier between Gideon and his God ?
The opposite occurred .
( Read Judges 6 : 23 , 24 ; ftn . )
Let us focus on two of these requirements ​ — avoiding slander and acting honestly in all our dealings .
Why must we avoid slandering anyone ?
The term “ Devil ” is derived from a Greek word meaning “ slanderer . ”
For example , if they work for us secularly , we make sure that they are fairly treated and paid in line with the agreement we have made with them .
“ You always stick to what you have agreed to do , ” he said .
We help others to become Jehovah’s friends ( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )
Consider the instructions Jesus gave 70 of his disciples when he sent them out by twos in order to preach : “ Wherever you enter into a house , say first : ‘ May this house have peace . ’
We warmly welcome to our meetings those whose dissatisfaction with modern - day society awakens in them a desire to learn more about the God we worship .
In a letter of appreciation for a convention , one family wrote : “ The program really reached our hearts .
What might we ask ourselves regarding our communication with Jehovah ?
Yet , that is what Jehovah wants us to do when we pray .
Even if we find such heartfelt expressions difficult to put into words , we are not without help .
After Jesus was born , Jehovah’s angel appeared to shepherds who were tending their flocks in the fields near Bethlehem .
After that , the angel was joined by “ a multitude of the heavenly army , praising God and saying : * ‘ Glory in the heights above to God , and on earth peace among men of goodwill . ’ ” ​ — Luke 2 : 13 , 14 .
Those shepherds certainly were not keeping to themselves the good things they had heard about the Christ !
When Mary brought her firstborn son to Jerusalem in order to present him to Jehovah as the Mosaic Law required , the prophetess Anna “ began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance . ”
Thus , news of the Messiah’s appearance continued to spread .
So a great many people were being put on notice : The future Messiah had arrived !
John’s modest comment would not fail to heighten Messianic expectations .
While that possibility cannot be ruled out , it cannot be confirmed .
The fact is that there were many conflicting interpretations of the 70 weeks in Jesus ’ day , and none come close to our present understanding .
However , the Gospels provide other sound reasons why the people would have been “ in expectation ” of the Messiah .
Could it be that they heard news of Jesus ’ birth when traveling through Israel ?
For our present understanding of the prophecy of the 70 weeks , see Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy ! chapter 11 .
They can consume our thoughts , sap our strength , and affect our very outlook on life .
King David of ancient Israel was beset by many hardships .
In a touching psalm , David answers : “ With my voice I call to Jehovah for help ; with my voice I plead with Jehovah for favor .
David’s heart swells with such gratitude that he wants to spend the rest of his days there and thus “ gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah . ”
David always looked with appreciation upon God’s arrangement for worship .
In our day , Jehovah’s arrangement for approach to him is not centered on a physical structure .
Instead , it involves God’s great spiritual temple ​ — the sacred arrangement of true worship .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ When we were enemies we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son . ”
God’s Word is read and explained publicly at our meetings .
2 : 10 .
Perhaps we have endured in the ministry for many years despite apathy , ill health , emotional pain , or persecution .
“ That looks more like Brother Russell than Brother Russell himself ! ” ​ — Viewer of the “ Photo - Drama ” in 1914 .
In an age when belief in evolution , higher criticism , and skepticism had eroded the faith of many , the “ Photo - Drama ” championed Jehovah as the Creator .
Now a new possibility caught their attention ​ — motion pictures .
The motion - picture industry was thus in its infancy in 1912 when Russell boldly launched preparations for the “ Photo - Drama . ”
Classical music accompanied many scenes .
Skilled operators played the voice and music recordings on phonographs , synchronizing the sound with color slides and film reenactments of famous Bible stories .
“ It encompassed the total picture from the creation of the stars to the glorious climax of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign . ” ​ — F .
Stuart Barnes , age 14 in 1914
Professional artists in Philadelphia , New York , Paris , and London hand painted the glass slides and the films , frame by frame .
22 : 9 - 12 .
An associate of Brother Russell told the press that this medium would “ interest countless thousands in Scripture , more than anything that [ had ] been done for religious advancement in the past . ”
Usherettes from local congregations gave out millions of free copies of the Scenario containing “ Photo - Drama ” images
The “ Photo - Drama ” premiered on January 11 , 1914 , at this fine New York City theater then owned and staffed by the International Bible Students Association
Author and film historian Tim Dirks described the “ Photo - Drama ” as “ the first major screenplay which incorporated synchronized sound ( recorded speech ) , moving film , and magic lantern color slides . ”
And none had a greater audience ​ — totaling some nine million in North America , Europe , Australia , and New Zealand during the first year alone !
Seven months thereafter came the cataclysm later called World War I .
It has been said that no other verse “ so succinctly summarizes God’s relationship with humanity and the way of salvation . ”
Living organisms are so intricate and well made that there must surely be some great intelligence behind their existence .
Let us see how the Bible explains the reason for Jesus ’ death and its value .
Yet that is not what Jehovah God originally purposed .
Even though he could not ignore the deliberate act of transgression on the part of the first man , God has not condemned all humanity to suffering and death forever on account of one man’s disobedience .
On the contrary , by applying the legal principle of “ life for life , ” he has balanced the scales of justice and made everlasting life possible once again for obedient humans .
Jesus willingly came to earth and gave his life to save mankind from sin and death
Thus , by surrendering his life , Jesus ransomed mankind from slavery to sin .
By so doing , he offered descendants of the first human couple the opportunity to enjoy the same perfect life that Adam and Eve once did .
Going back to John 3 : 16 , we note the words “ whosoever believeth in [ Jesus ] should not perish , but have everlasting life . ”
If we are to “ have everlasting life , ” we need to believe in Jesus and obey him .
Such a change will necessarily affect our values , our choices , and everything we do .
As seen at John 10 : 16 , Jesus noted : “ I have other sheep , which are not of this fold ; those too I must bring in , and they will listen to my voice , and they will become one flock , one shepherd . ”
On numerous occasions , the Bible speaks of Paradise conditions to come on earth .
* Does such a prospect not appeal to you ?
We have good reason to believe that those promises will soon be realized .
If you pause to consider all that God has done for you and for mankind as a whole , it is clear that he has already done a great deal .

We face a subtle enemy that can undermine our self - sacrificing spirit .
This article will identify that enemy and show how we can use the Bible to help fight it .
A positive viewpoint can help us to endure in our worship of Jehovah .
17 Family Worship ​ — Can You Make It More Enjoyable ?
23,192,500
“ GO HOME to your relatives , and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he has shown you , ” said Jesus Christ .
Jesus ’ words show that he understood a basic human trait ​ — the desire to share matters of interest and importance with relatives . ​ — Mark 5 : 19 .
In the first century , Andrew was one of the first ones to identify Jesus as the Messiah .
And whom did he immediately tell of his discovery ?
Do you see a lesson in that ?
We do well to act similarly .
We may be able to share some thoughts with our relatives and create opportunities for them to come in contact with Bible truths and with fellow believers .
He too dedicated his life to Jehovah , and today he is an elder in the local congregation .
That may simply reinforce their reluctance .
It is also useful to put our relatives in contact with brothers who are of the same age group and who have similar interests .
Doing this can bridge the gap . ”
He did not take offense when some claimed that he had lost his mind .
In time , James and Jude , another of Jesus ’ half brothers , went on to enjoy wonderful privileges . ​ — Acts 1 : 12 - 14 ; 2 : 1 - 4 ; 1 Cor .
15 : 7 .
As in the first century , some relatives today need considerable time before they get onto the way to life .
In 2003 she herself got baptized .
What advice does she give ?
And they never gave up hope that he would eventually accept their faith .
How can we apply this counsel ? ​ — Prov .
Her well - thought - out speech can be refreshing and promote peace .
When is her husband relaxed and easily approachable ?
What sort of topics does he enjoy talking or reading about ?
Is he interested in science , politics , or sports ?
The apostle Peter gave valuable counsel to wives whose husbands do not share their beliefs : “ Be in subjection to your husbands , so that if any are not obedient to the word , they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives , because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect .
How does Christa try to reach his heart ?
And in all things we should behave “ with a mild temper and deep respect . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
3 : 15 .
How did Peter show that selfish tendencies can be overcome ?
WHEN Jesus was on earth , he set a perfect example of self - sacrifice .
By remaining faithful to death on the torture stake , he proved that his spirit of self - sacrifice had no limit . ​ — Phil .
2 : 8 .
( Read Matthew 16 : 24 . )
In fact , Jesus taught that an unselfish spirit is at the heart of our worship .
And think of the blessings we enjoy because we are part of a worldwide brotherhood that displays the spirit of self - sacrifice !
That enemy is our tendency to be selfish .
Eve acted out of a selfish desire to be like God .
Her husband manifested a selfish desire to please her .
How can we recognize signs of selfishness in ourselves ?
For example , if we just glance at a mirror , we might fail to notice a small but significant blemish .
Similarly , to use the Bible to see a defect , such as selfishness , we should do more than read it casually or use it to see someone else’s faults .
Here , James used a Greek word that denotes scrutiny or careful consideration .
James continued : “ He goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is . ”
In contrast , the successful man not only “ peers into the perfect law ” but also “ continues in it . ”
Most important , after you meditate on what you have read , strive to apply it .
How did Saul come to develop selfish thinking ?
Saul greedily took the spoil instead of destroying it as God had commanded .
And Saul arrogantly built a monument to himself .
Second , we should beware of focusing only on areas in our life in which we are doing well , ignoring aspects that we need to work on .
He relates : “ It was very hard to admit to my wife and to the elders what I’d been doing .
In what amounted to an effort to protect himself , Peter disowned Jesus three times . ​ — Matt .
He endured trials that could be viewed as more severe than the ones he stumbled over earlier .
Peter’s example can help us to cultivate a spirit of self - sacrifice .
How can we display the spirit of self - sacrifice in difficult circumstances ?
When Peter and the apostles were imprisoned and then flogged because of their preaching , they rejoiced “ because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [ Jesus ’ ] name . ”
You too can view persecution as an opportunity to imitate Peter and follow in Jesus ’ footsteps by displaying the spirit of self - sacrifice .
Or if you prepare diligently for your meeting parts but have little interest in sharing in cleaning the Kingdom Hall , you could set a goal to apply the advice found at Romans 12 : 16 . ​ — Read .
When we look carefully at ourselves in the mirror of God’s Word and see flaws , even evidences of selfishness , we might become discouraged .
He remembered what he saw in the mirror and kept working to improve .
Jehovah is willing to help you , as he has helped so many of your brothers who , although imperfect , can and do have God’s favor and blessing .
What may make maintaining a positive viewpoint a challenge ?
How can the experiences of the needy widow , Elijah , and the writer of Psalm 102 help us to cultivate a positive viewpoint ?
Jehovah assures us of his love and helps us to endure in our service to him .
Despite having these reasons for happiness , some faithful servants of God struggle with negative thoughts about themselves .
One way he is with us is by means of his Word .
Let us , then , consider how we can use the Bible to help us cultivate and maintain a positive viewpoint .
The apostle Paul described some things that may help us to cultivate a positive viewpoint .
You might hesitate to take that test , especially if you feel that you might fail .
He examines his worshippers , not to condemn them , but to find their good qualities and to help them .
An effective way to conduct this self - examination is to meditate on the example of faithful people referred to in the Bible .
Let us look at three examples that illustrate how you can use the Bible to verify that you are “ in the faith ” and thus to cultivate a positive view of yourself .
( b ) What negative feelings might the widow have had ?
At the temple in Jerusalem , Jesus watched a needy widow .
Her example can help us to maintain a positive viewpoint despite our limitations .
Would she be embarrassed at seeing the large donations made by those ahead of her , perhaps wondering whether her offering was really worthwhile ?
Even if she had such feelings , she still did what she could in behalf of true worship .
Jesus showed that both the widow and her contribution were valuable to Jehovah .
Her donation would be mixed in with what others gave , yet Jesus singled her out for praise .
Because of age or infirmity , the amount of time that some are able to preach the good news is very limited .
Think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year .
When , like the needy widow , you are doing all you can in Jehovah’s service , you have solid reason for believing that you are “ in the faith . ”
12 - 14 . ( a ) How did negative feelings affect Elijah ?
The prophet Elijah was loyal to Jehovah and had strong faith .
Yet , at one point he felt so low that he asked Jehovah to put him to death , saying : “ It is enough !
Now , O Jehovah , take my life away . ”
Wicked Queen Jezebel sent a message to Elijah that she was arranging for him to be killed .
Alone with his thoughts , Elijah reflected on the seeming futility of his work as a prophet .
He told Jehovah : “ I am no better than my forefathers . ”
He had , in effect , tested himself by his own standards and had decided that he was a failure , of no value to Jehovah or anyone else .
But the Almighty saw Elijah differently .
Jehovah also provided food and drink that would sustain Elijah during his 40 - day trip south to Mount Horeb .
The next time you benefit in one of these ways , consider the true Source of your help and offer a prayer of thanks to Him . ​ — Ps .
Jehovah values our devotion and faithfulness to him ; he does not measure us by our accomplishments .
Then , in a sense , the words in one of Jesus ’ parables can be said to you : “ Enter into the joy of your master . ” ​ — Matt .
102 : 10 .
How can prayer help someone who battles negative thoughts ?
( Read Psalm 102 : 19 - 21 . )
Psalm 102 also shows how you might gain a more positive viewpoint .
Yes , we can use the Bible to prove to ourselves that we are in the faith and are valuable to Jehovah .
If it is , could it be a reflection of how the family worship is being conducted ?
Can you meet that challenge ?
“ We have to be flexible , ” says a father of two in Germany .
For the sake of variety , different family members read the parts of various individuals mentioned in a Bible portion .
Another way to create variety is to work together on a project , such as building a model of Noah’s ark or of Solomon’s temple .
For example , in the living room of a family in Asia was a five - year - old girl with her parents and grandmother .
Sometimes young ones get tired , so fathers need to put forethought into the material chosen and take time to prepare well .
A father in Germany informs his family in advance what they will consider in the weeks to come .
When scheduling a Bible - based DVD as part of their family worship , a father of six preteen children in Benin provides questions ahead of time .
Many fathers have to work long hours just to make ends meet .
What responsibilities do adult children have toward their aging parents ?
JEHOVAH never intended for humans to suffer the debilitating effects of aging .
3 : 3 .
( b ) What can senior members of the congregation ask of God ?
So David likely made the request we read at Psalm 71 : 9 .
Such faithful older ones can be sure that God will answer their prayers .
After all , those prayers echo the same legitimate concerns that David expressed under divine inspiration .
I am Jehovah , ” says Leviticus 19 : 32 . Yes , honoring the older ones in the congregation was a serious responsibility when those words were written , and it is down to this day .
What , though , about actually providing care for them ?
God’s Word tells us : “ Honor your father and your mother . ”
( a ) The apostle Paul set out what principle about providing for parents ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 4 , 8 , 16 . )
Consider the context of what Paul wrote to Timothy .
He made it plain that believing children , grandchildren , and other relatives of elderly widows were to be the primary providers .
Thus , no unnecessary financial burden would be on the congregation .
Exactly how children provide care varies . No two situations are alike .
11 : 23 .
Could the health issue be temporary , one with which some in the parents ’ congregation would be happy to help ? ​ — Prov .
One was a missionary in South America , the other worked at world headquarters , in Brooklyn , New York .
All in the family appreciated the loving concern .
The Bible says about the Jerusalem congregation that “ no one was in need among them . ”
Evidently , some had little materially , but “ distribution would be made to each one according to his need . ”
Later , a situation developed locally .
Even so , the apostles ’ response illustrates that the congregation can help to care for needy members .
As noted , Paul gave Timothy instructions outlining the circumstances under which Christian widows would qualify for material assistance from the congregation .
If an accident occurs , how can the congregation help ?
For instance , the elders may be able to help out by assisting the parents to learn about and benefit from governmental or social programs locally .
How do some Christians help older members of the congregation ?
They make it a point to show extra interest in older members of the congregation .
While realizing that their own circumstances do not allow them to engage in the full - time ministry , they are happy to assist the children to remain in their chosen careers as long as possible .
What an excellent spirit such brothers show !
17 , 18 .
In some cases , aging causes despondency , even depression .
In the meantime , God’s servants must keep their hope fixed on what is everlasting .
In addition to maintaining strong faith in God’s promises , though , what can help you meet the responsibilities of caregiving ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What challenges do many families face , raising what questions ?
IT CAN be heart - wrenching to realize that your parents , once strong and self - sufficient , are no longer able to look after themselves .
The elderly may find it hard to accept that physical changes or other circumstances now limit their independence .
What can be done ?
One article on care for the elderly states : “ While it is difficult to discuss the issues of aging , the family who has discussed the options and agreed on plans will be better able to handle whatever happens . ”
The value of such a discussion is best appreciated when we acknowledge that trials that come with age cannot be avoided .
What may families have to do when elderly parents increasingly need assistance ?
It is usually wise to have a family meeting to discuss cooperation , needs , and strategies .
If he or she is confronted with a degenerative illness , learn what future developments you can expect .
24 : 10 ; Phil .
All too many families do not make plans , and then they are forced to make difficult decisions hurriedly when a crisis occurs .
Long - term planning , on the other hand , makes future adjustments less traumatic . ​ — Prov .
20 : 18 .
How can parents as well as children benefit from a discussion about living arrangements for the elderly ?
Be realistic and recognize that not all may see things as you do and that it takes time for anyone ​ — whether parent or child — ​ to adjust his thinking .
All should realize that problems may be avoided by planning and discussions .
The points addressed on the Health Care Proxy that Jehovah’s Witnesses use are definitely topics to be covered during these discussions .
Appointing a health - care agent ( where legally possible and accepted ) can ensure that someone who is trusted will make the appropriate decisions if needed .
Confusion , depression , incontinence , and loss of hearing , sight , and memory may be a result of aging ; yet , if some of such health problems appear , they may well be effectively treated .
If your parents ’ problems cannot be resolved , changes may need to be made in their care or living arrangements .
In case you live some distance from your parents , might it be sufficient for a fellow Witness or a neighbor to drop by on a regular basis and then let one of the children know how the parents are doing ?
Would minor modifications in the home make it easier and safer for them to get around , bathe , and so on ?
Whatever the situation , investigate what services are available locally .
How have adult children who live far away from their parents continued to honor and care for them ?
Because of other obligations , however , many grown children do not live near their parents .
In such cases , some have used vacations to visit and help care for their needs , doing chores that the parents are not now able to do .
If you are not near them and your parents are Witnesses , you can speak with the elders in their congregation , asking for their recommendations .
( Read Proverbs 11 : 14 . )
Even if your parents are not Witnesses , you want to “ honor your father and your mother . ”
Some parents prefer not to live with adult children and their families ; they value their independence and do not want to be a burden .
And the caregiver’s situation might change , making it necessary to review the current arrangements .
It is upsetting to see the painful effects of age on beloved parents .
If that happens , do not be quick to take offense .
Such conversations can help you put emotional reactions in perspective .
Accepting nursing - home care for her was not an easy decision to make . Emotionally , it was very , very hard .
However , it was the best solution for her in the last months of her life , and she accepted that . ”
In some areas , it is normal and even preferred that family members of multiple generations live together or have regular close contact .
Imagine another scenario : A single mother with two children receives an invitation from a couple in her congregation to spend an evening with them .
However , the day before the visit , the couple tell the mother that something unexpected has come up and that they have to cancel the invitation .
After inviting her , the couple were invited by some friends to come to their home that same evening , and they accepted . As Christians we should , of course , keep our word .
We should never find ourselves saying , as it were , “ ‘ yes ’ and yet ‘ no . ’ ”
However , as the two examples illustrate , not all situations are the same .
The apostle Paul once found himself in such a situation .
In his defense Paul asked : “ Well , when I had such an intention , I did not view the matter lightly , did I ?
The word translated “ lightly ” has the sense of fickleness , as if a person was unreliable , not keeping his promises .
Paul’s rhetorical question “ do I purpose things in a fleshly way ? ”
At 2 Corinthians 1 : 23 , we read that ‘ it was to spare them ’ that he changed his original plan to go to Corinth .
As he had hoped , while he was in Macedonia , Paul heard from Titus that his letter had indeed moved them to sorrow and repentance , which gave him great joy . ​ — 2 Cor .
“ The Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you through us , that is , through me and Silvanus and Timothy , did not become ‘ yes ’ and yet ‘ no , ’ but ‘ yes ’ has become ‘ yes ’ in his case . ”
His Yes meant Yes !
Nowadays , it is common for people who do not live according to Bible principles to make promises and then break them if a minor problem arises or something more appealing turns up .
But if you as a Christian make a promise or a commitment , you really should do all you can to keep it .
A short time after writing 1 Corinthians , Paul did indeed travel via Troas to Macedonia , where he wrote 2 Corinthians .
The Bible Changes Lives 8
According to a poll in France , half of French citizens pray or meditate at times “ simply to feel better . ”
If you believe in God , do you see the effects of prayer in your life ?
That is why Jesus encouraged his followers to pray , even though his Father well knows our basic needs .
At times , we may find it difficult to know precisely what to ask for in prayer .
When we realize that God has intervened in our personal life , even in very subtle ways , we feel drawn to him .
The Bible assures us that Almighty God answers the prayers of his faithful servants , but it also gives reasons why he does not listen to some prayers .
Clearly , those who show contempt for God’s laws or pray with improper motives cannot expect to be heard by God . ​ — Proverbs 28 : 9 ; James 4 : 3 .
Not necessarily .
Even though the answer to his petitions did not take the form he wanted , Paul accepted God’s response with gratitude . ​ — 2 Corinthians 12 : 9 , 10 .
“ This is the confidence that we have toward him , that no matter what we ask according to his will , he hears us . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 14
True , some Bible characters did receive miraculous answers to their prayers .
God’s answer to a plea for help may come through the pages of the Bible What , though , if we pray to find relief from an ongoing problem ?
In like manner , God may grant the proper “ desires of [ our ] heart ” in due time if we keep praying . ​ — Psalm 37 : 4 .
According to the text in the original language , the judge paid attention to the widow so that she would not “ strike [ him ] under the eye , ” or figuratively , “ damage [ his ] reputation . ”
As Jesus said , God “ will cause justice to be done to them speedily . ” ​ — Luke 18 : 6 - 8 .
By persevering in prayer , we show the genuineness of our desire to see God’s hand in our life .
If we do , then we may experience the power of prayer , as discussed in this article .
For more information , see chapter 17 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Using vivid hyperbole , he urged : “ If , now , your right eye is making you stumble , tear it out and throw it away from you . ”
The point ?
Consider , too , the faithful man Job , who said : “ I have made a covenant with my eyes .
So how could I show improper attention to a virgin ? ”
The Bible states : “ Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire .
It wasn’t easy .
A man named Filipe , who overcame his addiction to pornography , states : “ I put the family computer where everyone could see it and installed Internet filter software .
Cody , mentioned at the outset , states : “ It took great effort to beat my pornography habit .
It feels great to have a clean conscience .
In the year 33 C.E . , Jesus died , rose from the dead , and ascended to heaven .
Much later , Jesus was given authority to rule as King .
They visit people to show them what the Bible says about God’s Kingdom .

No One Can Serve Two Masters
▪ Imitate the Faith of Moses
11 : 27 .
▪ Be of Good Courage ​ — Jehovah Is Your Helper !

MOSES knew what Egypt had to offer .
Yet , when he was 40 years of age , Moses made a decision that must have baffled the royal Egyptian family who had adopted him .
He chose , not even the “ normal ” life of a common Egyptian , but a life among slaves !
Why ?
We too need to see more than what appears to our physical eyes .
When he was reproached , how did faith help him to appreciate his privileges of service ?
What did Moses recognize about the “ enjoyment of sin ” ?
With eyes of faith , Moses recognized that the “ enjoyment of sin ” was temporary .
“ By faith Moses , when grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter . ”
I don’t have any regrets . ”
Only this : to fear Jehovah your God , to walk in all his ways , to love him , to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul , and to keep the commandments and statutes of Jehovah that I am commanding you today for your own good . ”
Moses “ considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt . ”
One of the Israelites had earlier sneered : “ Who appointed you as a prince and a judge over us ? ”
To prepare for and deal with reproach , Moses shared his fears and concerns with Jehovah .
Fourth , Jehovah gave Moses a partner and spokesman , Aaron , to help him carry out his assignment .
What privileges from Jehovah should we appreciate ?
All of us have the privilege of declaring the good news .
After all , it is Jehovah who commissioned you , and he will help you to succeed .
In the same ways that he helped Moses .
The prospect of future blessings helped Moses not to view his 40 years as a fugitive and his 40 years in the wilderness as a wasted life .
Although he did not have all the details regarding the outworking of God’s promises , his eyes of faith could see the unseen reward .
Like Moses , we still do not have all the details regarding God’s promises .
( b ) What will we consider in the next article ?
Keep your eyes open to the consequences of sin , the excelling value of serving Jehovah , and your hope of eternal life .
In the next article , we will examine how faith helped Moses to see “ the One who is invisible . ” ​ — Heb .
1 , 2 . ( a ) Explain why Moses appeared to be in danger .
PHARAOH was a formidable ruler and a living god to the Egyptians .
In their eyes , he “ surpassed all mundane creatures in wisdom and power , ” states the book When Egypt Ruled the East .
To inspire fear in his subjects , Pharaoh wore a crown with the image of a cobra ready to strike ​ — a reminder that the king’s enemies would quickly be annihilated .
Before Moses left Pharaoh’s presence , he prophesied that the king’s firstborn son would die .
Finally , Moses instructed every Israelite family to slaughter a goat or a ram ​ — an animal sacred to the Egyptian god Ra — ​ and to splash its blood on their doorways .
What will we examine about Moses ’ faith in “ the One who is invisible ” ?
And how did Moses ’ ability to see “ the One who is invisible ” strengthen him when he and his people were in peril ?
“ I felt humiliated , ” she said .
Next , Ella was placed in solitary confinement for three days .
By means of her faith , she maintained her integrity .
Faith in Jehovah will help you to conquer your fears .
( Read Proverbs 29 : 25 . )
51 : 12 , 13 .
Focus your attention on your almighty Father .
By strengthening your faith now , you can come to see Jehovah as a real Person who is eager to help you .
Moses knew that Jehovah is trustworthy , and he exercised faith in Jehovah’s promise to execute the firstborn sons in Egypt .
Jehovah has instructed us to convey what important message ?
Faith in Jehovah’s promises will nurture your desire to share the good news ( See paragraph 13 )
By faith , do you see those angels poised to release the destructive winds of the great tribulation on this world ?
We might ask ourselves , ‘ Am I , like the Samaritan , “ moved with pity ” to give a witness ? ’
After all , we would never want to be like the priest and the Levite in the parable , excusing ourselves and going by “ on the opposite side . ”
Why did the Israelites feel trapped ?
Was this predicament unexpected ?
How did faith strengthen Moses at the Red Sea ?
Because his eyes of faith saw something far more powerful than a sea or an army .
Jehovah prophetically describes our vulnerable condition as “ the land of unprotected settlements . . . , unprotected by walls , bars , or gates . ”
We need not waver in fear .
Why not ?
In my zeal , in the fire of my fury , I will speak . ’ ”
Your faith in the outcome of “ the great and awe - inspiring day of Jehovah ” will help you to “ see the salvation of Jehovah ” and to maintain your integrity . ​ — Joel 2 : 31 , 32 .
Prepare now for those thrilling events by continuing “ steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible ” !
Strengthen your friendship with Jehovah God through regular study and prayer .
LIFE STORY
As told by Robert Wallen
Reflecting on 65 years in the full - time ministry , I can truly say that my life has been filled with pleasurable days .
ON September 7 , 1950 , I became a member of the Brooklyn Bethel family .
On July 1 , 1939 , at ten years of age , I was baptized at a zone assembly ( now called a circuit assembly ) in Columbus , Nebraska , U.S.A .
Mother , along with other Witnesses in the Omaha Congregation , gave me much - needed encouragement .
While at the convention , I attended the meeting for those who were interested in serving at Bethel .
So one day in early August , while I was on my way to look for a job , I first stopped at our mailbox .
After about eight months in the Bindery , I was assigned to the Service Department to work under the direction of Brother Thomas J .
It was a pleasure to work with him and to benefit from the spiritual wisdom and insight he had gained over the years in the organization .
After I had spent almost three years in the Service Department , Max Larson , the factory overseer , told me that Brother Knorr would like to see me .
I have often said that I could never have paid for the education I received working with Brothers Sullivan and Knorr , as well as with others in Bethel , such as Milton Henschel , Klaus Jensen , Max Larson , Hugo Riemer , and Grant Suiter .
Brother Knorr was a tireless worker who wanted to see the Kingdom activity progress to the greatest extent possible .
I need them at my desk . ”
As a result , I caused him much embarrassment .
I felt terrible , so I wrote a brief letter saying that I deeply regretted what I had done and felt that it would be best for me to be transferred out of his office .
That changed , however . About the time of the international convention at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in 1958 , I saw Lorraine Brookes , whom I had met in 1955 when she was pioneering in Montreal , Canada .
Lorraine and I renewed our acquaintance in 1958 , and she accepted my proposal of marriage .
It was too costly to telephone , and there was no e - mail in those days !
In 1964 , I was given the privilege to visit other countries as a zone overseer .
How true the words of Isaiah : “ My servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart . ” ​ — Isa .
It continues to amaze us to see the large number of young men and women who have taken up the full - time service with the attitude of Isaiah , who said : “ Here I am !
Send me ! ”
You never know where it may lead you . ”
How do Bible principles help us to have the right view of family obligations ?
In what ways does Jehovah bless our decisions when we put him first ?
* “ I wanted to lighten his load and to help buy our son , Jimmy , some of the nice things his schoolmates enjoyed . ”
Marilyn also wanted to help their extended family and to save up for the future .
Still , she reasoned , others had gone abroad for a time , and their families seemed to survive spiritually .
Her husband did not want her to leave , although he said that he would not try to stop her .
Despite her misgivings , Marilyn kissed James and Jimmy good - bye and left for a job overseas .
“ I won’t be gone for long , ” she promised .
To avoid starvation , the patriarch Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy food .
They may , however , be laboring under crushing debt .
Though it grieves emigrants to leave behind a mate or children , many who go abroad feel that they have no choice .
We can trust that Jehovah will bless us as he promises .
The Law of Moses contains this principle that applies to Christians : Parents need to give their own children spiritual training .
( b ) What emotional and moral damage can separation cause ?
So did her husband and son .
But to Jimmy , it felt as if his mother had abandoned him .
( a ) How can substituting material gifts for a parent’s presence affect children ?
Although Marilyn tried to compensate for her absence by sending money and gifts , she saw that she was alienating her son and unintentionally training him to put material things ahead of spiritual interests and family relationships .
“ Don’t come back , ” Jimmy would tell her .
“ Just keep sending presents . ”
Marilyn came to see that even though she and her husband did not commit adultery , while living apart they could not follow the Bible’s direction to fill each other’s emotional and sexual needs .
“ I had to start rebuilding my spiritual and family life . ”
The elders in her overseas congregation commended her for her faith and courage .
“ How will you make ends meet if you go back home ? ” Instead of making such discouraging comments , fellow Christians should “ advise the younger women to love their husbands , to love their children , to be . . . working at home , ” their own home , “ so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively . ” ​ — Read Titus 2 : 3 - 5 .
Now she , her husband , and their children are happy that they all stayed together .
A Witness named Vicky relates : “ For a few years , I was raised by my grandmother , while my parents kept my younger sister with them .
But I will do so more out of duty , while my sister will care for them more out of love .
Vicky has seen that the only successful course is to put Jehovah and his principles ahead of financial goals and family expectations .
Jesus plainly said : “ No one can slave for two masters , ” for God and for Riches . ​ — Matt .
See “ Immigration ​ — Dreams and Realities ” in the February 2013 issue of Awake !
Reports from various countries indicate that living apart from a mate or children in order to work abroad is a factor that for some has contributed to serious problems .
What challenges do many emigrants face when they return home ?
( See opening image . )
“ I understood that I had neglected my children when they most needed my guidance and affection , ” admits Eduardo .
His oldest daughter , Anna , recalls : “ I felt emotionally insecure not having our father at home with us .
How did one father begin to repair the damage his absence had caused , and with what result ?
“ When we saw him reaching out in the congregation , we felt proud . The world was trying to pull us away from Jehovah .
Indeed , as God’s Word states , children will benefit if they receive parental attention and training . ​ — Prov .
With determination and patience , you may gradually regain your family’s love and respect .
We should not constantly be striving for a higher standard of living or for future financial security .
But money cannot protect and sustain us the way godly wisdom can .
Many emigrants return with even greater debt .
( Read Proverbs 22 : 7 . )
But all of them cooperated and did not spend money on nonessentials .
Eduardo made up his mind not even to consider job offers that would keep him away from his family for months or years at a time .
“ Instead , ” he says , “ I learned to do various jobs so that when one type of work was not available , I could do another . ”
‘ The hand of Jehovah is not short . ’
In many places , people feel obliged to give money and gifts to relatives and friends .
Returning emigrants as well as those who decline opportunities to leave their family to go abroad often face the anger , scorn , and disappointment of relatives who may have looked to them as breadwinners .
“ Nevertheless , ” notes Eduardo’s daughter Anna , “ when we refuse to sacrifice spiritual things for material advantage , some of our relatives may eventually realize how important our Christian life really is .
My husband even had to step down from serving as an elder .
Jehovah always blesses decisions based on faith in him , but how can he bless a decision that is contrary to his will , especially when it involves needlessly giving up sacred privileges ? ​ — Read Hebrews 11 : 6 ; 1 John 5 : 13 - 15 .
Ask yourself : ‘ Under what circumstances am I willing to obey Jehovah ?
The elders cannot make decisions for you , but they can help you make choices that will lead to happiness in the long run . ​ — 2 Cor .
“ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 3 .
21 , 22 .
Their families have serious problems .
Choose to obey Jehovah and trust in him .
See the series “ How to Manage Money ” in the September 2011 issue of Awake !
15 : 3 .
Why does Jehovah sometimes hold off from rescuing us from adversities ?
First , let us consider how God warns us when we are developing bad inclinations .
Having divine favor would preserve a good relationship with God .
Through his Word , the Bible , he warns us when we are headed in the wrong direction .
In our daily Bible reading , we often come across a passage that helps us to overcome bad tendencies and unwholesome inclinations .
And at our congregation meetings , all of us receive counsel that comes at just the right time !
6 , 7 . ( a ) Why may it be said that material that is prepared for millions is evidence of God’s loving care for you ?
To benefit from God’s warnings , we must first realize that he is truly concerned about us .
( Read Isaiah 55 : 6 , 7 . )
8 , 9 .
Before coming into the truth , one brother regularly viewed pornography , but he overcame the habit .
Yet , his old inclination was still there , smoldering like the embers of a fire .
He used the phone to access pornographic Internet sites .
He received timely counsel , benefited from the correction given , and eventually overcame the bad tendencies .
3 : 6 .
Though the brother was concerned about where he would find a place for his family to live , he said : “ Jehovah will provide .
This impressed the landowner so much that not only did he allow them to stay but he gave them additional land to cultivate .
Yes , Jehovah guides us through his Word to help us cope with life’s difficulties .
12 , 13 .
In what situations might some wonder if God really notices their suffering ?
And what about those grievous personality conflicts we occasionally experience with someone in the congregation ?
‘ This should not happen in God’s organization ! ’ you exclaim .
13 : 1 , 2 ; Hab .
The comment that you considered to be so hurtful may , in fact , have been well - deserved counsel that you ought to give thought to .
Later , Brother Rutherford greeted Brother Klein with a cheerful , “ Hello , Karl ! ”
Still , we may become impatient when a trialsome period seems to have no end .
Suppose you are driving a car on a highway and get stuck in traffic .
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 - 10 . )
4 : 7 - 9 .
For whom is Jehovah searching , and why ?
Jehovah takes note of the righteous ones and blesses them .
Think , for example , of the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah .
6 : 4 , 6 ; 1 Tim .
5 : 25 ; Heb .
She immediately called at the address , but no one was at home .
She called back again and again . At times , she sensed that someone was there , but no one answered . She left literature , personal letters , her contact information , and so forth .
The sister was greeted by a friendly lady , who said : “ Please come in .
How do you feel about Jehovah’s watchful care ?
Rather , may you feel ever closer to the caring God who is truly concerned about you !

Consider the following :
For instance , Dixon foretold the outbreak of a World War III in 1958 , and Cayce predicted that New York would slide into the ocean in the mid - 1970 ’ s .
Is there really any reliable way to see the future ?
Will the earth be destroyed in a disaster ?
A rebuilt wall in the ruins of ancient Nineveh For example , it would really be a remarkable feat to predict accurately that a great city , powerful for many centuries , would soon collapse .
Instead , they destroyed it . Could any political analyst have predicted those events with such accuracy ?
If such an unusual prediction came true , it would surely make the forecaster famous .
God announced that a man named Cyrus would launch the conquest of a nation .
But God can do more than that . He can even control and change factors and trends to ensure the outcome .
He actively guarantees a perfect record of success .
You can respond similarly to Bible prophecy .
I say , ‘ My decision will stand , and I will do whatever I please . ’ ”
Contrary to what doomsday prophets say , God assures us that our planet Earth will never be destroyed . ​ — Psalm 104 : 5 ; Ecclesiastes 1 : 4 .
God is aware that the majority of religions have slandered him and ignored the Bible , and he will destroy those institutions . ​ — Revelation 18 : 4 - 9 .
God’s heavenly government ​ — not any humans or forces on earth — ​ will destroy all wicked , disobedient people .
God will preserve individuals whom he approves , and they will flourish on a beautiful earth .
“ Take note of the blameless one , and keep the upright one in sight , for the future of that man will be peaceful . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 11 , 37 ; Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
Anthony : Sure , what is it ?
Anthony : May I show you some Bible verses that highlight the importance of exercising faith in Jesus ?
Tim : OK .
Maybe you would like to read this scripture .
Tim : Yes , I’ve heard it a lot , and I often see it quoted on signs and billboards .
Looking at it carefully , notice what Jesus said .
Specifically , faith in the only - begotten Son , Jesus Christ .
Regarding the purpose of The Watchtower , it says that among other things , this magazine “ promotes faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now ruling as King of God’s Kingdom . ”
Tim : Well , there you go . Right in your own magazine is proof that Jehovah’s Witnesses believe in Jesus .
Or they may have been taught this misconception by their minister .
“ I have made your name known to them and will make it known , so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them . ”
Tim : Hmm .
Anthony : Well , maybe we could look at another scripture that sheds light on the matter .
Tim : Yes , of course .
Anthony : So the salvation of his followers is one reason why it was important to Jesus that they know and use God’s name .
Even so , by telling us his personal name , God has made it easier for us to draw close to him .
Even though we have never met Moses , Noah , or Jesus , just knowing their name makes these men more real to us .
Anthony : And that’s another reason why Jehovah’s Witnesses use God’s personal name so much .
We want to help people build faith in Jehovah God as a real Person whom they can draw close to .
Anthony : Earlier we read John 14 : 6 .
Would you please read what Jesus said in the last part of that verse ?
Would you say , then , that true faith is an either - or matter ? Is it a question of belief in Jesus versus belief in Jehovah ?
Jesus said we need both .
Maybe we can discuss that question another time .

Do you have a particular Bible subject that you have wondered about ?

The second article shows what effect Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 7 : 12 should have on our preaching activity .

While on earth , Jesus enjoyed observing creation , being with friends , and sharing in meals .
With great joy , they willingly and eagerly shared the Kingdom message with others . ​ — Luke 10 : 1 , 8 , 9 , 17 .
Love moves us to continue preaching despite any apathy we encounter
Why do we continue to declare the good news even though we may encounter some apathy or indifference ?
Let us consider some points that have helped many of our fellow workers to maintain or renew their zeal for the ministry in challenging territories .
Because doing so shows that we have real interest in helping honesthearted individuals to understand the Bible .
Several of her Bible students began attending our meetings regularly .

What helped Madaí to start so many studies ?
Making return visits and conducting Bible studies requires diligent effort .
By applying ourselves in the Kingdom - preaching work , we can help others to “ come to an accurate knowledge of truth , ” and that can mean salvation for them .
How can we make good use of illustrations in our ministry ?
That experience illustrates the value of asking tactful , well - chosen questions .
“ When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts , it is foolish and humiliating , ” states Proverbs 18 : 13 .
Many believe that it is a condition of conscious separation from God .
After hearing the person’s answer , we will be in a better position to help him understand what the Bible says on the subject .
For instance , what if someone we meet in the ministry says that he does not believe in God ?
Our patient and loving approach may move him to want to learn more .
It enables us to be “ fully competent , completely equipped for every good work . ”
Much of our effectiveness in the ministry depends , not on the number of scriptures we read , but on the way we reason on and explain those we do read .
8 , 9 . ( a ) What is one way to reason with someone who believes that Jesus is equal to God ?
( b ) What other lines of reasoning on this subject have you found to be effective ?
What scriptures could we use to reason on the matter ?
( b ) What reasoning have you found to be effective when discussing hellfire ?
The person might assume that the blessings described in that verse apply to life in heaven .
Illustrations also made Jesus ’ teaching appealing and memorable .
The person may mention siblings ​ — even twins .
Instead , he spoke of God as being his Father .
What illustration shows that it would be illogical for God to have the Devil torment people in hellfire ?
Most parents would say that eventually they would have no choice but to punish the child .
No doubt , the parent would be angry with such a person .
Driving home the point of the illustration , we might ask the parent , “ Knowing that an evil individual had influenced your child , would you ask that person to punish your child for you ? ”
Clearly , then , God would not use Satan to punish the very same people who have been influenced by the Devil himself to do bad things !

On the other hand , even if we feel that we are not especially gifted , we can be effective in our ministry .
Jehovah can help us to see how we should “ answer each person . ”
Does the way we treat people in the ministry make a difference ?
( See opening image . )
The brother handed the woman an umbrella while he shared one with his wife . The couple were delighted to see the woman present on the night of the Memorial .
What contributed to such a fine reaction ?
What is the Golden Rule , and how can we apply it ?
What is the Golden Rule ?
We often apply the Golden Rule in our dealings with fellow believers .
( Read Luke 6 : 27 , 28 , 31 , 35 . )
Considering such questions can remind us to treat each householder as an individual .
6 , 7 .
15 : 1 ; 1 Pet .
3 : 15 .
Why should we not hold back from sharing the Kingdom message with “ people of all sorts ” ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 . )
Why should we show respect for the homes of others ?
In today’s crime - filled world , many householders are suspicious of strangers .
We should avoid adding to such suspicion .
In your area , would that most likely disturb the householder ?
We are eager to spread a positive message , and our motives are good .
Nevertheless , we wisely avoid doing anything that could unduly disturb people in our witnessing territory .
Let us always show respect for the householder’s property and privacy ( See paragraph 10 )
As Christians , most of us lead busy lives .
How can we show respect for a householder ?
So we should try to put the householder at ease .
One traveling overseer has found the following approach to be effective . After exchanging greetings , he hands the householder a copy of the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth ?
If the householder chooses one , the brother opens the tract and discusses what the Bible says about that question .
What , then , are some ways in which we follow the Golden Rule in our ministry ?
By acting in a kind and considerate manner , we are letting our light shine , are underscoring the value of Scriptural principles , and are giving glory to our heavenly Father .
As told by Kenneth Little
With my bride , Evelyn , I stepped off the train at Hornepayne in the bush country of northern Ontario , Canada .
On our family farm in southwestern Ontario
“ Are you people not interested in a Bible study ? ”
Sister Huntingford asked .
Sister Huntingford could not have visited us at a better time .
Because in the church foyer , the minister posted a list of all donors in the order of the amount they had given .
My parents , who were of modest means , were usually near the bottom of the list , and the church elders pressured them to give more .
Therefore , we left the church but still sought a way to satisfy our spiritual need .
When she later realized that we would not betray her to the authorities , she introduced us to Bible literature .
So a brother named Ted Sargent urged me to be courageous and put faith in Jehovah .
With that gentle nudge , I began pioneering in November 1951 .
I felt at home right away .
He regularly visited them in their homes but not just when they had problems .
In the heart of a Canadian winter , we boarded an overnight train with a number of experienced traveling overseers who were returning to their assignments .
One brother even insisted that we take the sleeping car accommodations he had reserved for himself , so that we would not have to sit up all night in a coach .
She had the special privilege of sharing a room with a dear anointed sister , Margaret Lovell .
Once again , Evelyn had to write a letter agreeing to our separation .
I was appointed as the new branch overseer ( now Branch Committee coordinator ) .
I have also been influenced in good ways by the hundreds of fine Christian men and women ​ — young and old — ​ who have passed through our lives here at the branch and in the various congregations where we have served .
Conducting morning worship for the Canada Bethel family
He also stated : “ The things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses , these things entrust to faithful men , who , in turn , will be adequately qualified to teach others . ”
Sometimes fellow Christians ask me what lessons I have learned during my 57 years of Bethel service .
My simple response is , “ Willingly and promptly do what Jehovah’s organization wants you to do , relying on Jehovah to help you . ”
41 : 13 .
What can be said about material creation , such as the countless stars and planets ?
The stars are organized into galaxies , each containing billions or even trillions of stars , as well as many planets .
Most galaxies are further organized into groups called clusters and into larger superclusters .
He wants them to maintain good order , and that is vitally important because they have so much important work to do .
In time , “ Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time . ”
Obediently , “ Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him , ” and with the cooperation of his family , he completed the building work in an organized way .
When Joshua was about to lead the Israelites into Canaan , he was told : “ Be courageous and strong . Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ” ​ — Josh .
Because Rahab aligned herself with Jehovah’s organization of that time , God saw to it that she and her household were spared when the Israelites conquered Jericho .
But what happened in later times ?
Over the centuries , the Israelites repeatedly violated God’s laws .
21 : 43 .
In the first century C.E . , Jehovah cast off the unfaithful nation of Israel .
Jehovah transferred his blessing to a dynamic new organization centered on Jesus Christ and his teachings .
It had its start on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E .
At that time , about 120 disciples of Jesus were gathered at a place in Jerusalem when “ suddenly there was a noise from heaven , just like that of a rushing , stiff breeze , and it filled the whole house . ”
This amazing event furnished undeniable evidence that Jehovah was backing the new organization , the one consisting of Christ’s disciples .
On that thrilling day , “ about 3,000 people were added ” to the number of Jesus ’ followers .
Furthermore , “ Jehovah continued to add to them daily those being saved . ”
Many sincere individuals thus accepted the truths proclaimed by members of this new organization .
Jesus taught his disciples to do the same work .
For Jehovah has commanded us in these words : ‘ I have appointed you as a light of nations , for you to be a salvation to the ends of the earth . ’ ”
Since the first century , the earthly part of God’s organization has been making known his provision for salvation .
Because of a Jewish revolt , Roman armies led by Cestius Gallus surrounded Jerusalem in 66 C.E .
However , faithful Christians survived because they heeded Jesus ’ warning .
Those early Christians prospered spiritually because they had God’s blessing . ​ — Prov .
Such activities contributed to the spiritual health and unity of Jehovah’s people at that time , even as they do today .
And what a delight it must have been when traveling elders , such as Paul , visited the congregations !
How grateful we are that Jehovah organized his servants then as well as now !
Are you keeping pace with it ?
See the articles “ Christians Worship With Spirit and Truth ” and “ They Keep On Walking in the Truth ” in The Watchtower of July 15 , 2002 .
An extensive discussion of the earthly part of God’s organization today has been published in the book Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom .
Why must we keep on moving ahead with Jehovah’s organization ?
( Read Zechariah 2 : 8 . )
The Bible assures us : “ The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous , and his ears listen to their supplication . ”
Do you see yourself among them as a survivor of “ the great tribulation ” ?
There has been remarkable growth in the number of God’s servants because Jehovah himself is backing his Witnesses .
I myself , Jehovah , will speed it up in its own time . ”
Whether we are anointed Christians or we are members of the great crowd , we can experience the bright future promised in God’s Word .

This is to be expected , for “ the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight . ”
And how important it is to take in accurate Scriptural knowledge , apply it , and make spiritual progress ​ — especially now that the great tribulation is drawing so close !
Moreover , such events as the special Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s day were joyful occasions .
As those associated with God’s organization , we have the joy of sharing in “ the holy work of the good news of God . ”
Engaging in this “ holy work ” makes us “ fellow workers ” with Jehovah , “ the Holy One . ”
And it surely is an inestimable privilege to be entrusted with “ the glorious good news of the happy God . ” ​ — 1 Tim .
1 : 11 .
God wants us to maintain good spiritual health by sticking to him and supporting his organization in its various activities .
Moses told the Israelites : “ I take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that I have put life and death before you , the blessing and the curse ; and you must choose life so that you may live , you and your descendants , by loving Jehovah your God , by listening to his voice , and by sticking to him , for he is your life and by him you will endure a long time in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your forefathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ”
Our life depends on doing Jehovah’s will , loving him , obediently listening to his voice , and sticking to him .
Once my mind had been resolved on that point , I determined to stay by the faithful organization .
If we are to have Jehovah’s favor and blessing as individuals , we must support his organization and accept adjustments in our understanding of the Scriptures .
All who remain loyal to Jehovah and his organization will have his continued blessing .
People “ will build houses and live in them ” and will enjoy “ the work of their hands . ”
Babylon the Great will no longer deceive anyone , for she will not exist .
In 1915 she said that she always found it surprising that many Bible Students expected to be taken to heaven soon .
When you consider what a terribly big part of the world South America is , it will be easy to see there is more harvest work to be done . ”
He arranged to have several publications translated into Portuguese .
Brother Young soon traveled to São Paulo , then a city of some 600,000 inhabitants .
There he gave the lecture and distributed the Millions booklets , as mentioned in the introduction of this article .
The August 1 , 1924 , Watch Tower mentioned that 50 were baptized in Brazil , mostly in Rio de Janeiro .
In 1915 , Sarah Ferguson was right , ‘ There was more harvest work to be done . ’ ​ — From our archives in Brazil .
The Scriptures refer to bread some 350 times , and Bible writers often used bread as a synonym for food .
But as time went by , they began to miss the variety of foods they had eaten in Egypt .
Literal bread gave the Jews daily sustenance , just as the manna had sustained the Israelites for 40 years in the wilderness .
“ If you love me , you will observe my commandments , ” Jesus said .
First , the wheat had to be moistened , pounded , and dried in the sun .
Grinding enough flour for the family could take hours , and “ the sound of the hand mill ” was common in towns in Bible times .
Prominent people , such as the Pharaohs , counted on professional bakers to prepare their bread , but in later years even the common people purchased bread .
It asked : “ ‘ Wonderful Shim Cheong , ’ Who Knew Nothing About Jesus ​ — Did She Go to Hell ? ”
To many , the idea that such a person would be punished in hellfire just because she was not a baptized Christian seemed unfair , even offensive .
The answer ? “ We do not know .
The New Catholic Encyclopedia states : “ Baptism is necessary for salvation .
Millions of people have died in ignorance of the Bible .
“ Truly I tell you today , you will be with me in Paradise . ” ​ — Luke 23 : 39 - 43 .
When the unrighteous are resurrected , will they be judged on the basis of their past actions ?
Later , she left because she was disappointed by what she saw going on there .

We might take that as an illustration of a path leading to spiritual goals .
Whether you are young or not so young , you can see the wisdom of that divine advice .
Young people generally have good health , quick minds , and a keen desire to succeed .
As you realize , though , the abilities of our young people are highly valued in the world .
When a young Witness does well in school , a guidance counselor , a teacher , or a fellow student may pressure the Witness to pursue higher education as a step toward success in this system of things .
He loved to play soccer .
That meant that before long , he could expect to receive elite sports training in Europe , perhaps leading to a professional career .
In view of that wise reality , Eric chose not to strive for a career in professional sports .

“ We are amazed at the joy we have from living a simpler life , doing just what Jehovah’s organization encourages us to do . ”
What spiritual goals might you set and reach ?
In due course , you will likely see how he can help you “ smooth out the course of your feet . ” ​ — Prov .
When Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her door , her interest in what the Bible says about God and the future was renewed .
Flavia accepted Bible truth and was baptized .
She says :
Jehovah has been good to me .
I will not turn my back on him . ”
There are Biblical accounts relating that the bodies or bones of dead people were burned .
But what amounted to cremation did not always carry such a meaning .
15 : 42 - 53 ; 1 John 3 : 2 .
Granted , we may not fully comprehend how God has performed the miracle of resurrection on past occasions or how he will do so in the future .
Still , we put our trust in Jehovah .

Christians do well to take into consideration social norms , local sentiments , and legal requirements regarding the disposition of dead bodies .
You likely know someone who is divorced ​ — perhaps a number of such ones .
She added : “ A storm of powerful , extreme emotions ​ — anger , regret , disappointment , despair , and shame ” often follows .
What is my purpose in life ? ’ ”
As a result , they may begin to think of the congregation as being cold and unsympathetic .
Yet , such experiences as those of Stanisław and Wanda show that divorced ones can come to realize that their brothers and sisters really do care about them .
Alicja admits : “ Eight years have passed since my divorce .
Our divorced fellow believers may be buffeted by the winds of challenging emotions , including anxiety over the future and feelings of loneliness or even rejection .
Recognizing that such feelings are common and at the same time hard to overcome , we should imitate Jehovah by giving such brothers and sisters our loyal support .
Some names have been changed .
Hence , it would be a serious mistake to entertain thoughts of filing for an unscriptural divorce from one person , perhaps while already planning to marry another . ​ — Gen .
Can you be a source of much - needed support ?
We may be able to accomplish much good even before or after a Christian meeting by saying something as simple as : “ How are you coping ?
I imagine you are going through a rough time .
For example , we repaired the lock on her door .
The sister whom this couple assisted regained her balance gradually .
He will not abandon any of his faithful servants .
This will help the divorced Christian to feel more confident as he or she moves on in life .
It brings us joy when we see that we have reached the goals we set for ourselves .
We sometimes study together in preparation for a meeting , and then we might make something delicious to eat . ”
“ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ” ​ — MATT .
That should not surprise us .
As Jehovah and Jesus worked together , the Son learned much about his Father’s qualities and had innumerable reasons to love him .
What does it mean to love Jehovah ?
3 , 4 .
For example , Moses told the Israelites : “ You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength . ” ​ — Deut .
6 : 5 .
“ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need , ” said Jesus , “ since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them . ”
The apostle Paul made that clear when he gave a witness to a group assembled on the Areopagus .
Yes , people can find God .
This is the greatest and first commandment . ” ​ — Matt .
In essence , we ought to love Jehovah fully , without reservation .
True love for Jehovah will draw us ever closer to him .
Of course , we cannot possibly list all the reasons why we should love God .
He also provides food and other things we need in order to sustain our life .
Undoubtedly , our heart overflows with love for Jehovah because he has made it possible for us to receive forgiveness of our sins if we are repentant and exercise faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice . ​ — John 3 : 16 .
In what ways has Jehovah given us hope ?
Anointed ones who prove ‘ faithful even to death will be given the crown of heavenly life . ’
What is our natural response to such prospects ?
Are we not filled with joy and peace , as well as love for the Giver of “ every good gift and every perfect present ” ? ​ — Jas .
God has given us the heartwarming resurrection hope .
How our hearts swell with love for our heavenly Father , who has given us the marvelous resurrection hope !
Jehovah really cares for us .
Jehovah has favored us with the priceless privilege of serving as his Witnesses .
Of course , the list of blessings and our reasons for loving Jehovah could go on and on .
How can study and application of God’s Word help us ?
Diligently study and apply God’s Word .
If we are experiencing distress , we can draw comfort from such loving assurances as these : “ A heart broken and crushed , O God , you will not reject . ”
“ Your loyal love , O Jehovah , kept supporting me .
When anxieties overwhelmed me , you comforted and soothed me . ”
Jehovah shows mercy to those who suffer , and Jesus similarly feels pity for people .
For instance , we may have seen that he does not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear .
If we have anxiety and turn to Jehovah in earnest supplication , we may well experience the incomparable “ peace of God . ”
It is not a burden to comply with God’s will if we truly love him .
These figures of speech help us to see that the elders provide needed spiritual help and refreshment .
By obeying those taking the lead among us , we show how much we appreciate these “ gifts in men ” and give evidence of our love for God and for Christ , the Head of the congregation . ​ — Eph .
Evidently alluding to the daily burning of incense under the Law covenant , the psalmist David sang : “ May my prayer be as incense prepared before you [ Jehovah ] , my uplifted hands like the evening grain offering . ”
May your humble petitions , your earnest supplications , and your heartfelt words of praise and thanksgiving to God be like the sweet - smelling incense that symbolizes acceptable prayers . ​ — Rev .
22 : 39 .
Jesus said that we must love our neighbor as we love ourselves .
( See opening image . )
But consider what Jesus said when a certain self - righteous man asked him : “ Who really is my neighbor ? ”
Jesus ’ illustration surely teaches us to show compassion and love for our neighbor .
It is often difficult to find compassionate people like the neighborly Samaritan .
This rule is expressed in these words spoken by Jesus during his Sermon on the Mount : “ All things . . . that you want men to do to you , you also must do to them .
This , in fact , is what the Law and the Prophets mean . ”
Happy is the man who does this . ”
According to the Mosaic Law , a person was to help an enemy to free his animal that had fallen under its load .
Because Christians show love , many of our enemies have softened their heart toward us .
If we show love for our enemies ​ — even rabid persecutors — ​ how happy we will be if some of them embrace true Christianity !
“ Stop judging that you may not be judged , ” said Jesus , “ for with the judgment you are judging , you will be judged , and with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you .
We want to show love for our neighbor in a unique way .
In the case of those who respond favorably , we play a role in filling that need by sharing with them “ God’s good news . ”
This may result in quite a change in a Bible student’s lifestyle .
It is heartwarming , indeed , to see how God helps those “ rightly disposed for everlasting life ” to make needed changes and come into a close relationship with him .
In the case of many , despair is thus replaced by joy , and undue anxiety by confidence in our heavenly Father .
( Read 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 - 8 . )
Let us briefly review what Paul said about love and see how we can apply his words to our relationship with our neighbor .
( a ) Why should we be patient and kind ?
“ Love is patient and kind . ”
“ Love is not jealous , ” so true love will not allow us to covet another person’s possessions or privileges in the congregation .
Moreover , if we have love , we will not brag or get puffed up with pride .
Genuine love is not easily provoked and “ does not keep account of the injury , ” as though we were making entries in a ledger when others do something unloving .
Love makes us rejoice with the truth , but it will not allow us to “ rejoice over unrighteousness , ” even if a person who hates us is mistreated or suffers some injustice . ​ — Read Proverbs 24 : 17 , 18 .
8 : 26 , 27 .
After referring to some commandments of the Mosaic Law , Paul stated : “ Whatever other commandment there is , is summed up in this saying : ‘ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ’
Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor ; therefore , love is the law’s fulfillment . ”
So we need to keep on showing neighbor love .
What blessings are in store for our neighbor if he responds to the good news with genuine appreciation !
We have many reasons for loving Jehovah without reservation .
By displaying love for God and for our neighbor , we are showing respect for what Jesus said about these vital matters .
“ The members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary . ” ​ — 1 COR .
What will help us to adopt Jehovah’s view of human weakness ?
1 , 2 .
The apostle Paul knew what it was like to be affected , even weakened , by pressures from outside the congregation and from within it .
( b ) How can we benefit from helping the weak ?

Rather , he was saying that Christians with more experience should be patient with those who were not yet firmly rooted in the truth .
31 : 12 .
15 : 7 , 11 ; Lev .
Illustrate .
How might some who may appear to be weaker really be “ rich in faith ” ?
Think of sisters who have been enduring family opposition for years .
Some may be of humble appearance and look fragile , yet do they not demonstrate outstanding faith and inner strength ?
And what of teenagers who stick to the truth despite the bad influences in school ?
We can make what analysis of our perception of human weakness ?
For example , how do we react when a teenager does not exercise discretion in his choice of entertainment or when he displays a careless attitude ?
Exhausted by this trek under the blazing sun , the prophet sat down under a tree and “ asked that he might die . ” ​ — 1 Ki .
( Read 1 Kings 19 : 5 - 8 . )
16 , 17 .
How can we imitate Jehovah’s care for Elijah ?
We should not be quick to offer advice .
It would be better first to take the time to express our empathy to those who may think that they are “ less honorable ” because of their personal circumstances .
For example , think of Cynthia , quoted earlier , whose husband abandoned her and her two daughters .
You may know from personal experience that it can take time to recover from a debilitating physical illness .
Similarly , a Christian who has been weakened by personal difficulties or very trying circumstances may need time to regain spiritual strength .
8 : 8 .
Never forget that as we provide support to our brothers , we experience the joy that only giving can bring .
Name has been changed .
How can young or newly baptized brothers be helped to reach their full potential ?
Why should we strive to look for the good in them , thus viewing them as Jehovah does ?
4 , 5 .
A number of Bible accounts make it clear that Jehovah sees not only the good in his servants but also their potential .
He acknowledged his doubts and his own sense of insignificance .
Jehovah trusted Gideon to deliver Israel because He had observed his skills .
Amos came from a remote village , but his knowledge of the customs and rulers of his time gave evidence that he was not ignorant .
Indeed , Amos ’ bold response to the corrupt priest Amaziah confirmed that Jehovah had chosen the right person and could use his abilities that might not at first seem obvious . ​ — Amos 7 : 12 , 13 , 16 , 17 .
( a ) What assurance did Jehovah give David ?
How do we feel when someone shows interest in the progress that we have made ?
Usually , it stimulates us to make additional progress , bringing out the best in us .
Who in particular may need our attention ?
Of course , all of us need special attention from time to time .
On the other hand , failure to give fitting recognition to such brothers may stifle their desire to reach out for more responsibilities , something that God’s Word encourages them to do . ​ — 1 Tim .
3 : 1 .
( a ) How did an elder help a young man to overcome shyness ?
Regarding Julien , a young man who was rather shy , Ludovic says : “ Because Julien at times attempted to assert himself in a somewhat clumsy way , his behavior was not natural .
But I could see that he was very kind and really wanted to help others in the congregation .
This is similar to the way Jesus viewed the apostle Peter .
During Paul’s first missionary journey with Barnabas , Mark served as an “ attendant , ” perhaps caring for their physical needs .
4 : 11 .
An elder showed me how to prepare myself and be more relaxed .
How did Paul express appreciation for his brothers ?
When we notice a good quality in another Christian , do we express how much we value that fine trait ?
For example , Paul acknowledged that Andronicus and Junias had been serving Christ longer than he had , emphasizing their Christian endurance .
Rico thought that he would have to wait until he was of legal age to serve Jehovah fully .
Frédéric , a congregation elder who was asked to study with the boy , relates : “ I commended Rico because such opposition indicated that he had been courageous enough to express his faith . ”
She noted that women may appreciate different details or efforts that they observe .
Thus their “ words of encouragement can complement what experienced brothers say . ”
He says : “ I have noticed that when I compliment young brothers on specific points in their ministry or for giving well - thought - out comments , they grow in confidence . As a result , they develop their abilities further . ”
15 : 23 .
All experienced Christians ​ — not just elders — ​ can help young brothers and new ones to achieve their full potential .
Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower ?
At what time was the Passover lamb to be slaughtered on Nisan 14 ?
Some Bible translations say that it was to be slaughtered “ between the two evenings , ” meaning at twilight or at dusk ​ — after sunset but before full darkness . ​ — 12 / 15 , pages 18 - 19 .
Jesus , as a rider on a white horse , has acted to rid the heavens of Satan and his demons .
The rider on a fiery - colored horse depicts the wars that have afflicted mankind .
( Rev .
How can we avoid letting our Yes be No ?
1 : 18 )
The Jews asked that the legs of the criminals alongside Jesus be broken .
How should I approach them ? ​ — 5 / 15 , pages 12 - 15 . How deadly has smoking been ?

OTHER BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED ​ — Are Natural Disasters Punishment From God ?
Crime and violence victimize innocent people .
Why do bad things happen to good people ?
Is God to blame for such things ?
Are calamities random occurrences , or are they man - made ?
Could it be Karma , that is , the result of one’s actions in a past life , that causes personal suffering ?
They did not become victims because of the way they had lived their lives ; they were simply under the tower when it happened to fall .
For God to intervene in such ways , it would mean that he knows about bad things before they happen .
Similarly , then , Jehovah can choose not to foreknow everything .
* What , then , may we conclude ?
Then the desire , when it has become fertile , gives birth to sin ; in turn sin , when it has been carried out , brings forth death . ”
Consider how man is made .
If God coerced people into following a certain course , would he not be nullifying the gift of free will ?
This does not mean , though , that the harm caused by human error and bad choices will forever plague mankind .
They are reaping the fruitage of what they did in their previous lives . ”
*
He instigated a rebellion in the garden of Eden .
Mankind in general follow Satan by heeding his urgings to ignore the good ways of Jehovah .
The Bible clearly tells us what Jehovah and his Son , Jesus Christ , will do about the suffering caused by Satan the Devil .
“ For this purpose the Son of God [ Jesus ] was made manifest , ” declares the Bible , “ to break up the works of the Devil . ”
As for “ the ruler of this world ” ​ — Satan the Devil — ​ Jesus promises that he “ will be cast out . ”
Gone will be the influence of wicked humans .
Under Christ’s rulership , no calamity will befall mankind . ​ — Proverbs 1 : 33 .
He listens because he is interested in us .
When we pray , God does not want us to use showy words or to repeat memorized prayers .

She took her ministry seriously but found little response to the Kingdom message in the area where she preached .
Shortly after arriving in the new congregation , Katherine met Doris , a woman in her mid - 40 ’ s , who accepted a Bible study .
After they had studied the first three chapters of the Bible Teach book , Katherine became concerned .
“ Doris was such a good student , and I didn’t want to mess that up , ” she relates .
“ Before I could bring up the subject , ” relates Katherine , “ Doris told me that she wanted to talk with me about a problem .
After listening to her , I told her how Jehovah had helped me to deal with a similar situation in life .
She thanked me . ”
The day you first came to my house , I had been reading my Bible for hours .
I was crying , asking God to send me someone to help me understand the Bible .
Jehovah had answered my prayer ! ”
After arriving on the island of Palau in 2007 , 22 - year - old Simon quickly found out that he could earn only a fraction of what he had earned in his home country , England .
“ I had to learn not to buy whatever I wanted .
Jehovah’s caring hand has been very evident to me on several occasions .
During the seven years I’ve served here , I’ve always had something to eat and a place to sleep . ”
This really prepared my heart to deal with that challenge .
Hannah copes with homesickness by focusing her attention on the brothers and sisters in their congregation .
The apostle Paul stated : “ Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully . ”
What fruits do they “ reap bountifully ” in Micronesia ?
Adds Hannah : “ I know that Jehovah would have drawn this woman to himself in one way or another , but because of serving where the need is greater , we were able to find and help this sheeplike one to get to know Jehovah .
In many lands , there is a need for more Kingdom preachers .
How did he train others ?
“ By setting a good example in following direction from Jehovah’s organization .
This has helped me to see that I have something of value to offer in Jehovah’s service . ”
He adds : “ We are blessed to have these experienced brothers in our midst . ”
At first glance , all the men seemed to be loyal worshippers of Jehovah .
They had deluded themselves into thinking that God would accept their worship .

Appropriately , the day before , Moses had predicted : “ In the morning Jehovah will make known who belongs to him . ”
Paul was sure that Jehovah could recognize hypocritical worship , and he was likewise convinced that Jehovah could identify those who are obedient to Him .
Paul manifested his strong conviction by the wording he chose when writing under inspiration to Timothy .
2 : 18 , 19 .
Paul mentions “ the solid foundation of God ” in the same context in which he quotes Moses ’ words about Korah and his supporters , recorded at Numbers 16 : 5 .
Jehovah’s purpose was not about to be thwarted by apostates in the congregation any more than it was by Korah centuries before .
Paul did not explain in detail what “ the solid foundation of God ” represents .
In ancient times , it was not uncommon to display an inscription on a building’s foundation , perhaps showing who built it or who owned it .
*
What confidence can we have ?
Rather , Jehovah is intensely interested in those who belong to him .
Although a devious person may skillfully deceive other humans for a while , Jehovah’s almightiness and righteousness guarantee that “ the one covering over his transgressions will not succeed . ” ​ — Prov . 28 : 13 ; read 1 Timothy 5 : 24 ; Hebrews 4 : 13 .
Each Christian should “ examine his own actions . ”
As we strive to be genuine and sincere in our worship , we reap many benefits .
“ Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt , in whose spirit there is no deceit , ” says the psalmist .
3 : 12 .
The Bible admonishes us : “ Keep testing whether you are in the faith ; keep proving what you yourselves are . ”
HAVE you ever seen the name Jehovah inscribed on a public building or on a museum artifact ?
We must live in harmony with his moral standards .
( Read 2 Timothy 2 : 19 . )
Consider the Scriptural background of Paul’s words found at 2 Timothy 2 : 19 .
They were openly disrespectful to Moses and rejected his God - given authority .
He perceives the loyalty of those who belong to him .
How did “ foolish and ignorant debates ” affect the early Christian congregation ?
Some members of the congregation were promoting apostate teachings .
They resulted in bickering and arguing over words , creating a spiritually unhealthy atmosphere .
Still , when exposed to unscriptural teachings , regardless of the source , we must decisively reject them .
The Scriptures set forth basic principles that a Christian can weigh when selecting entertainment .
What illustration did Paul use to highlight the need to avoid bad associations ?
In a house , some utensils may become contaminated by dangerous substances or unsanitary conditions .
The Bible makes specific mention of how decisively the Israelites acted when told to “ get away from around the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . ”
There was no hesitation or procrastination .
This is the spirit behind Paul’s words when he admonished Timothy to “ flee from youthful desires . ”
Jesus conveyed a similar message when he said : “ If your eye makes you stumble , tear it out and throw it away from you . ”
How have some today acted with decisiveness to protect themselves from spiritual dangers ?
Although it might not be easy to “ renounce unrighteousness , ” what gives us confidence and comfort ?
We must “ renounce unrighteousness ” and “ turn away from what is bad . ”
LIFE STORY
In 1916 he founded the Wolf Cubs ( or Cub Scouts ) for younger boys in my age group .
We also learned a lot about nature , which made me appreciate the handiwork of our Creator .
On the latter occasion , some 33,000 Scouts from 85 countries and territories were present .
Rudi Tschiggerl , a pastry chef , was the first person to witness to me In the spring of 1958 , I was about to finish my apprenticeship as a waiter at the Grand Hotel Wiesler of Graz , Austria .
I had never before heard anything about the truth .
He first brought up the Trinity doctrine and said that it is not a Bible teaching .
Rudi showed insight and did not offer me anything more in print .
It was connected with the Grand Hotel in Bad Hofgastein , and sometimes I worked there to get experience beyond what I learned in class .
Later , I learned that they had served as Witness couriers in Nazi Germany when the work was banned prior to World War II .
Then , during the war , they were transferred to the camp in Ravensbrück , near Berlin .
That is why I did not want to waste their time by having discussions with them and then perhaps after some weeks or months have to tell them that I did not want to continue .
He did not want to have any more discussions with me .
The sisters discussed most of the meeting material between the two of them , since there was no baptized brother present to take the lead .
After accompanying them for the first time , I asked if I might have my own territory to work .
That did it for me !
He granted my request and paid me the same wage .
Surprisingly , I still got the same pay !
In 1963 , I was invited to do circuit work .
Sometimes I traveled by train from congregation to congregation , carrying heavy suitcases .
However , before leaving the United States , I was asked to accompany a circuit overseer for four weeks .
Merete and I continued to serve together in the circuit and district work until 1976 .
We finally decided to carry a small electric heater with us to keep the temperatures bearable at night .
I am happy to say that over the years , my dear wife has always been a great support .
This has been a big help .
I was privileged to work with him and was later asked to oversee translation work into ten Eastern European languages .
Subsequently , about 5,000 brothers were integrated into the organization .
What a victory for Jehovah and what a blow for Satan !
We took up service at Brooklyn Bethel in July 1990 .
Now I enjoy the privilege of participating in preparing and dispensing spiritual food to our worldwide brotherhood .
I also look forward to observing from heaven the earthly resurrection and , at last , finding my physical father .
I look forward to observing from heaven the earthly resurrection and , at last , finding my physical father
Now , instead of a congregation servant and an assistant congregation servant , within each body of elders a coordinator and a secretary are appointed .
WHAT does it mean to be a witness ?
One dictionary gives this definition : “ Someone who sees an event and reports what happened . ”
What a privilege it is to bear the name Jehovah , for he is “ the King of eternity , ” who says : “ This is my name forever , and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation ” !
Afterward , many letters of appreciation were published in this journal .
Also , can you explain the Scriptural context from which our name , Jehovah’s Witnesses , is taken ?
( b ) What else were Israelite parents commanded to do , and why does the same need apply to parents today ?
One way Israelite parents witnessed was by teaching their children about God’s dealings with their forefathers .
Those parents may also have explained to their children that when Moses first approached Egypt’s ruler to ask permission for the Israelites to worship Jehovah in the wilderness , Pharaoh replied : “ Who is Jehovah , that I should obey his voice to send Israel away ? ”
Of course , it could also be related that after ten plagues devastated the land and after the Israelites escaped from Egypt’s army at the Red Sea , the answer to Pharaoh’s question became clear for all to see .
Moreover , like the Canaanite gods they worshipped , they became cruel , sacrificing their children and oppressing the poor .
Jehovah had foretold a marvelous act of deliverance from captivity that the Israelite nation would witness .
That was 125 years before Jerusalem’s destruction in 607 B.C.E .
Today , Jehovah has also had his people give ample notice of what lies ahead .
For 135 years , from its very first issue , The Watchtower has called on its readers to be awake to the fact that Satan’s wicked rulership will soon end and be replaced by the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ . ​ — Rev .
20 : 1 - 3 , 6 .
All of this was foretold by Isaiah , including Jehovah’s promise that he would provide for and protect his repentant people as they returned to Jerusalem .
To enhance our appreciation for the honor of bearing God’s name , it is good for us to meditate on its meaning .
And yet , the meaning of God’s name is not limited to what he himself chooses to become .
It includes what he causes to happen with regard to the work of his Witnesses in accomplishing his purpose .
But how can we be Jehovah’s Witnesses and at the same time be witnesses of Jesus ?
That question will be the subject of our next article .
Why it is fitting
Jehovah created all things
He causes his creation to do whatever is needed to accomplish his will
How did Jesus live up to the meaning of his name ?
When on trial for his life , Jesus Christ said those words to the Roman governor of Judea .
3 : 14 .
Bible scholars in general agree that the name Jesus comes from a Hebrew name , Jeshua , and contains a shortened form of the divine name ; it means “ Jehovah Is Salvation . ”

Thus , from his Father’s right hand in heaven , Jesus began to see his name take on greater meaning as thousands repented and put faith in him as Jehovah’s means of salvation . ​ — Acts 2 : 5 , 11 , 37 - 41 .
To what extent did Jesus ’ disciples witness , and how was this possible ?
Did those early disciples of Jesus have the needed courage to keep on witnessing about him ?
As indicated by Jesus , such apostasy , promoted by “ the wicked one , ” Satan , would grow and obscure true Christianity until “ the conclusion of the system of things . ”
Anointed Christians seized this opportunity to witness , resulting in thousands more anointed ones being gathered to become Christ’s joint heirs .
7 : 9 , 10 , 14 .
True , such witnessing is not always easy .
We can do just as the apostle Paul and his companions did .
We cannot do this in our own strength , but following the example of the early Christians , we must pray that Jehovah by means of his spirit will give us “ the power beyond what is normal . ” ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 4 : 1 , 7 ; Luke 11 : 13 .
Can those inspired words be applied to Jehovah’s Witnesses today ?
Even in well - worked territories , we still find people who are willing to listen and with whom we can share our wonderful message of salvation .
Whether we are baptized Christians or we are working toward that goal , we have every reason to be thankful for the privilege of associating with the worldwide congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
* ​ — DAVID OF ISRAEL , 11TH CENTURY B.C.E . “ The nations are like a drop from a bucket . ” ​ — ISAIAH 40 : 15
Why ?
One reason is that God is a much higher life - form than mere humans .
“ God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man , and He sees all his steps . ” ​ — JOB 34 : 21 .
Given the immense scale of the universe , many people ask , ‘ Why should the almighty Creator watch what lowly humans do on a tiny planet ? ’
Rather , Jehovah assures us : “ I will give you advice with my eye upon you . ” ​ — Psalm 32 : 8 .
“ O Jehovah , you have searched through me , and you know me . ” ​ — PSALM 139 : 1 .
Consider David , the Israelite king mentioned in the first article of this series .
Yes , David was convinced that even though he sinned ​ — gravely at times — ​ Jehovah could discern his repentant heart .
“ The Son of God . . . loved me and handed himself over for me . ” ​ — GALATIANS 2 : 20 WHY SOME HAVE DOUBTS : Even when they desperately need comfort , some people feel that it is selfish to ask God to intervene and help them cope with their problems .
WHAT GOD’S WORD TEACHES : God has already intervened in a remarkable way to help and comfort humans .
* But is that sacrifice merely for the human race as a whole , or does it reflect God’s interest in you personally ?
He was so moved by the sacrifice of Jesus that he wrote : “ I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and handed himself over for me . ”
WHAT GOD’S WORD TEACHES : When we feel lost , Jehovah does not give up on us .
The lesson ?
How does God “ search for the one that is straying ” ?
In the first century C.E . , God sent the Christian disciple Philip to intercept an Ethiopian official’s chariot and discuss the meaning of a Bible prophecy that the official was reading .
God also guided the apostle Paul and his companions to a river outside the city of Philippi .
Who today call on people in their homes and in public areas to share the Bible’s message about God ?
Ask yourself , ‘ Could it be that God is using them to reach out to me ? ’

In time , I began to feel that the church , like society in general , failed to support the weak .
I thought to myself , ‘ I cannot stop the war , but I can at least try to stop violent people . ’
A friend had come by with two of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Little did I know that from that moment on , my life was going to change .
I was impressed by the peace and confidence that the Witnesses radiated .
He began to talk about the Bible’s hope of a resurrection .
And Romans 12 : 19 warns : “ Do not avenge yourselves , . . . for it is written : ‘ “ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , ” says Jehovah . ’ ”
Those scriptures and others helped me slowly to gain peace within myself .
I have also been blessed with a wonderful , loyal wife , Anita , who is my dear partner in the full - time ministry .
My heart still goes out to people who suffer because of violence .
The boy thinks about this for a few moments and then asks , “ Daddy , who made God ? ”
Have you not heard ?
Jehovah , the Creator of the ends of the earth , is a God for all eternity ” !
Because our limited life span gives us a completely different concept of time from that of Jehovah .
Because God is eternal , to him a thousand years are like a day .
Where did it come from ?
Only he could have breathed life into everything else . ​ — Job 33 : 4 .

What was accomplished by godly women of the past ?
68 : 11 .
The first human pair were led to think that they did not need Jehovah as their Ruler .
In many lands , how are females treated ?
In certain lands , females are considered undesirable children , and far more baby girls than baby boys are aborted .
Yes , “ everything ” Jehovah made was “ very good . ”
The behavior of men and women in general deteriorated after the rebellion in Eden , and during the past century , it has become worse than ever before .
Throughout mankind’s history , however , the “ Sovereign Lord Jehovah ” has shown favor to men and women who have trusted in him , have obeyed his laws , and have submitted to him as their Ruler . ​ — Read Psalm 71 : 5 .
How many people survived the Flood , and why ?
If Noah’s brothers and sisters were still alive at that time , they too died in the floodwaters .
The billions of humans now living descended from those eight individuals who had Jehovah’s backing . ​ — Gen .
Why did God - fearing wives of faithful patriarchs have Jehovah’s backing ?
It is hard to imagine that serious cries of complaint would have come from the lips of Abraham’s respectful wife , Sarah , when they left the comforts of Ur and became temporary residents living in tents in another land .
Instead , “ Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . ”
It is no surprise that her husband , Isaac , “ fell in love with her , and . . . found comfort after the loss of his mother . ”
Abigail was a noteworthy woman who lived in the 11th century B.C.E .
Many men , women , and children died when the Babylonian forces destroyed Jerusalem and its temple in 607 B.C.E .
They willingly did menial work .
What a privilege it was to be the mother of the greatest man ever to live on earth ! ​ — Matt .
Give an example showing Jesus ’ attitude toward women .
Some women who were Jesus ’ disciples ministered to him and his apostles .
That outpouring of holy spirit was foretold in the words : “ I [ Jehovah ] will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh , and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . . .
God has indeed granted faithful women the privilege of participating in the fulfillment of the psalmist’s words : “ Jehovah gives the command ; the women proclaiming the good news are a large army . ” ​ — Ps .
For instance , we can meditate on the loyalty of Ruth .
With his help , for example , godly women maintained their integrity under Nazi and Communist rule when many of them suffered and some even lost their lives because of their obedience to God .
In effect , as in the case of the ancient Israelites , Jehovah grasps their right hand and says : “ Do not be afraid .
I will help you . ” ​ — Isa .
4 : 12 .
How do our tracts prompt us to use the Bible on initial calls and on return visits ?
Understandably , Moses asked Jehovah : “ Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt ? ”
Moses must have felt inadequate and incapable .
3 : 9 - 12 .
Thus , Moses said to Jehovah : “ Suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice , for they will say , ‘ Jehovah did not appear to you . ’ ” ​ — Ex .
3 : 15 - 18 ; 4 : 1 .
So he threw it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from it .
Yes , God put in Moses ’ hand the means by which he could prove that his message was from Jehovah .
4 : 29 - 31 ; 7 : 8 - 13 .
The same question may be asked of us when we go forth to share the Bible’s message with others : “ What is that in your hand ? ”
In many cases , the Bible will be in our hand , ready for use .
That is why the apostle Paul could write : “ The word of God is alive and exerts power . ”
Once a person realizes this about Jehovah’s Word , what he reads in the Bible can exert a powerful force in his life .
How can we ‘ handle the word of the truth aright ’ ?
What did one service overseer say about the tracts ?
Each tract prompts us to read a well - chosen scripture .
Then read Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
Likewise , when using the tract How Do You View the Bible ?
The back of each tract provides a question under the heading “ To Think About ” and scriptures that can be discussed on a return visit .
For the tract Can the Dead Really Live Again ?
Use the tracts as stepping - stones for starting Bible studies .
and point to a specific lesson in it .
leads into lesson 9 .
14 , 15 .
Paul had an earnest desire to relate to “ as many people as possible ” in his ministry .
( Read 1 Corinthians 9 : 19 - 23 . )
A circuit overseer says this about the way he and his wife focus on the Bible : “ Most householders will allow us to read one verse if we are brief and to the point .
Is it hard for many men in your area to make a living ?
To comfort others , how can you use Jeremiah 29 : 11 ?
But how is that possible ? ”
Then direct attention to an appropriate lesson in the Good News brochure .
Follow that up with an offer to explain more about Jehovah God .
( a ) In what way can Proverbs 30 : 4 be used to teach someone God’s name ?
and then read one scripture ​ — Psalm 83 : 18 .
God’s provision of the ransom sacrifice ?
What need do humans have , and who can satisfy that need ?
However , the Person with whom we need to develop the closest relationship of all is our Grand Creator . ​ — Eccl .
What does Jehovah promise us , but why do many people not believe that promise ?
Jehovah urges us in his Word to “ draw close ” to him , and he promises us that if we do , “ he will draw close ” to us .

Yet , many people think that it is unrealistic to believe that God wants to be close to them ; they feel that they are unworthy to approach him or that he is too remote to be approached .
The fact is that Jehovah “ is not far off from each one ” who wants to find him ; it is possible to get to know him .
( Read Acts 17 : 26 , 27 ; Psalm 145 : 18 . )
What example did King Asa set for the people of Judah ?
Put yourself in Asa’s situation .
Do not let mortal man prevail against you . ”
How thankful we can be that Jehovah has taken the initiative to draw us to him and to help us to form and maintain a close bond with him !
What role does Jesus play in Jehovah’s purpose ?
Jehovah has made it possible even for people who lived before the time of Christ to benefit from the ransom .
How do the Scriptures highlight this truth ? Paul wrote : “ God recommends his own love to us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”

Thus far in this article , we have quoted or cited scriptures from 14 different Bible books .
For example , at Exodus 34 : 6 , 7 , Jehovah described himself to Moses as “ a God merciful and compassionate , slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth , showing loyal love to thousands , pardoning error and transgression and sin . ”
Who would not be drawn to someone like that ?
Jehovah knows that the more we learn about him through the pages of the Bible , the more real he will become to us and the closer we will feel to him .
Jehovah could have had the angels do the writing of the Scriptures .
After all , they have a keen interest in us and our activities .
No doubt , the angels could have written down God’s message to mankind .
We can understand the thinking and emotions of Bible writers and others mentioned in the Scriptures . We can empathize with their disappointments , doubts , fears , and imperfections as well as rejoice in their joys and successes .
( See paragraphs 13 , 15 ) How does Jonah’s prayer speak to your heart ?

Consider , for example , whether an angel could fully have conveyed the emotions of Jonah when that prophet ran away from his God - given assignment .
Why can you relate to what Isaiah wrote about himself ?
After seeing a vision of God’s glory , the prophet was moved to say about his own sinfulness : “ Woe to me !
I am as good as dead , for I am a man of unclean lips , and I live among a people of unclean lips ; for my eyes have seen the King , Jehovah of armies himself ! ”
15 , 16 . ( a ) Why can we relate to what fellow humans feel ?
No , the angels are perfect in every way and are superhuman .
12 : 15 .
If we ponder over what the Bible says about Jehovah’s interactions with his faithful servants of the past , we will learn countless wonderful things about our God , who patiently and lovingly drew close to those imperfect humans .
Azariah said : “ Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him ; and if you search for him , he will let himself be found by you , but if you abandon him , he will abandon you . ”
Rather than calling out again to Jehovah for help , he sought an alliance with pagans .
18 , 19 . ( a ) What should we do if we have allowed some distance to develop between God and us ?
And may Jehovah draw ever closer to us now and throughout all eternity !
“ Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying , ‘ This is the way . ’ ” ​ — ISA .
30 : 21 .
What must we do to receive God’s guidance ?
How does Jehovah communicate with his servants ?
To some , God spoke through angels or by means of visions or dreams , thus revealing to them what would happen in the future .
Today , Jehovah guides his people by means of the Bible , his holy spirit , and the congregation .
In effect , Jesus also conveys Jehovah’s voice to us as he directs the congregation through “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
5 : 9 .
Satan tries to influence the thinking of people by providing false information and deceptive propaganda .
Although such sources may feature items of interest , they often advocate conduct and standards that are contrary to Jehovah’s standards .
How can those who love God’s righteousness avoid being swept along by today’s flood of satanic propaganda ?
Since it is practically impossible to listen to two voices simultaneously , we need to ‘ know the voice ’ of Jesus and listen to him .
He is the one whom Jehovah appointed over His sheep . ​ — Read John 10 : 3 - 5 .
“ Pay attention to what you are hearing , ” said Jesus .
We can avoid such a disastrous mistake if we remain alert to any warning signs and act immediately to correct matters .
Early detection of disease may save a person’s life .
How much better it is to avoid going astray by acting promptly to prevent such a serious mistake ! How can a good spiritual routine protect you from Satan’s schemes ?
Consider how each of these traits can interfere with our listening to the voice of Jehovah and can lead us to take a disastrous course .
A proud person has an exaggerated opinion of himself . He may feel that he has the right to do whatever he wants and that no one can tell him what to do .
So he may feel that he is above the direction and counsel of fellow Christians , the elders , or even God’s organization .
What a crucial lesson this historical account teaches us !
Why , Naaman’s leprosy stuck to greedy Gehazi ! ​ — 2 Ki .
When Achan’s wrongdoing came to light , Joshua told him that Jehovah would bring disaster upon him .
Achan and his family were stoned to death on that very day .
What should we do if we notice in ourselves tendencies toward pride and greed ?
He sent angels to minister to him , provided His holy spirit to help him , and guided him in selecting the 12 apostles .
Jehovah’s voice was heard from the heavens , expressing His support and approval of Jesus .
( Read Luke 11 : 10 - 13 . )
It is essential , though , that we ‘ pay attention to how we listen . ’
Why is it dangerous to rely on ourselves ?
But when David relied on himself , his heart deceived him and he committed a serious sin with Bath - sheba , even arranging to have her husband , Uriah , killed .
Peter went on to become one of the pillars of the first - century Christian congregation .
Suddenly it was gone , leaving a gaping hole in my life .
When Jehovah disciplines us , the experience may be painful .
Even if we have been removed from a position of responsibility in the congregation , we still have an opportunity to examine the quality of our faith and demonstrate our love for Jehovah .
David sang : “ Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned , whose sin is covered .
“ For a long time , my feelings of inadequacy prevented me from returning to serve the brothers as an overseer .
Jehovah has helped men to recover their joy and their desire to serve again
If you feel that you are the victim of a misunderstanding or an injustice , do not allow resentment to dominate your thoughts .
Your work as a faithful elder made Jehovah’s heart rejoice , even as it did yours . ​ — Prov .
Prove your love for Jehovah by joyfully engaging in sacred service Jehovah has helped men to recover their joy and their desire to take the lead in the congregation .
The Sadducees , who did not believe in the resurrection , tried to entrap Jesus with a question about the resurrection and brother - in - law marriage .
First , it is reasoned that the Sadducees likely had in mind an earthly resurrection and that Jesus would have answered them accordingly .
Second , Jesus ended his reply by referring to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ​ — faithful patriarchs who are in line to be resurrected to life on earth . ​ — Luke 20 : 37 , 38 .
“ Those who have been counted worthy of gaining . . . the resurrection from the dead . ”
Faithful anointed ones are “ counted worthy of the Kingdom of God . ”
Other translations render that phrase “ they are not subject to death any longer ” and “ death has no more power over them . ”
Anointed ones who finish their earthly course in faithfulness are raised to heaven and given immortality ​ — endless , indestructible life .
*
If Jesus was , in fact , talking about the heavenly resurrection , then his words do not shed any light on whether resurrected ones on earth will be able to marry in the new world .
Understandably , we may have many questions about life in the new world .
By the summer of 1914 , millions in large cities had flocked to the “ Photo - Drama of Creation , ” an eight - hour epic produced by the International Bible Students Association ( I.B.S.A . ) .
There were three types to choose from , each available in a number of languages : The “ Eureka X ” set had all the recorded narration and music .
Inexpensive phonographs and projection equipment could also be obtained .
How many saw the “ Eureka Drama ” is hard to determine .
Yet , in 1915 only 14 of 86 “ Drama ” teams reported regularly .
Some 30,000 individuals had requested Bible literature .
Many among them found Bible truth ​ — more precious than gold — ​ and could exclaim “ Eureka ! ”
See “ From Our Archives ​ — A 100 - Year - Old Epic of Faith ” in The Watchtower , February 15 , 2014 , pages 30 - 32 .
LIFE STORY
She was receptive and soon became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
In the late 1940 ’ s , her mother learned from studying the Bible with the Witnesses that hell is , not a place of torment , but mankind’s common grave .
Both Minnie and her husband became Witnesses .
In 1953 we moved to Grants Pass , Oregon , to help the small congregation there .
The first Kingdom Hall in Bauru ​ — a rented place with a sign I painted , 1955
The city had a population of over 50,000 , and we were the first Witnesses there .
I made arrangements to use the club facilities to hold an assembly .
When the local priest insisted that the contract be canceled , the president met with club members and told them : “ If you cancel , I resign ! ”
In those days travel was primitive .
“ They belong to God . ” We arranged to show a film about our worldwide preaching work , entitled The New World Society in Action , but the priest formed a mob to attack us .
When the priest and his mob of parishioners arrived at the theater , they were met by a solid wall of policemen with guns pointed at them .
Now , over 50 years later , there are more than 60 thriving congregations in that region as well as a beautiful Assembly Hall in the nearby city of Itajaí !
In the 1970 ’ s , I was privileged to serve as convention overseer in the large Morumbi Stadium .
As the soccer players left the stadium that night , some were heard to mock , “ Look at all the little women with their brooms and mops . ”

What position did Jehovah’s Witnesses take during World War II and later , and why ?
He said : “ By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ”
As a result of holding to this Christian position , thousands of Witnesses , young and old , male and female , have been persecuted .
Regardless of the vicious persecution they faced in Europe , the Witnesses never forgot their commission to preach the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom .
They faithfully did so ​ — in prisons , in concentration camps , and in exile .
How has the neutrality of Jehovah’s Witnesses affected observers ?

What illustrates that God’s organization is interested in the spiritual needs of all people ?
This pattern of translation and teaching is being repeated in many cultures .
Some 120 languages are spoken in the country , but well over ten million speak Nepali and many others use it as a second tongue .
Millions upon millions of tracts , brochures , and magazines have been distributed in campaigns throughout the world , without charge to the public .
Publications in Low German are useful in Paraguay ( See also opening image )
Many have simplified their life , learned another language , and adapted to a different culture in order to share in this vital Christian work .
Witnesses do all of this because they are convinced that they have found the truth .
We can benefit from comments by devoted Christians of our time , who are convinced that they have the truth .
The vast majority ​ — including some who formerly lived in a way that God did not approve of but who changed — ​ maintain a clean and exemplary lifestyle . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 .

As I have studied over the years , I have always tried to test those pillars and have asked myself if they were on truly solid ground .
A married sister who is serving at the world headquarters in New York commented about Jehovah’s organization : “ It is the only one that unwaveringly proclaims Jehovah’s name .
How logical that is when we recall that the divine name appears some 7,000 times in the Bible !
I appreciate the encouragement found at 2 Chronicles 16 : 9 : ‘ The eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ’ ”
She continues : “ The truth has shown me how to have a complete heart so that Jehovah can freely show his strength toward me .
A former atheist confessed : “ The creation convinces me that God wants mankind to enjoy life and therefore he will not allow suffering to go on forever .
Only Jehovah’s spirit could produce this modern - day miracle . ” ​ — Read 1 Peter 4 : 1 - 4 .

As we go about our preaching assignment , may others become impressed not only with what we teach from the Bible but also with our glowing conviction .
Who is the source of our tribulations ?
DOES it shock you that you can expect to face “ many tribulations ” before you gain the prize of everlasting life ?
( See opening image . ) ( b ) Who is behind our tribulations , and how do we know ?
Jesus told his followers : “ A slave is not greater than his master .
After healing a man who was lame from birth , Paul and his companion Barnabas were hailed as gods .
All too soon , however , Jewish opposers arrived , and they used slander to poison the minds of the people .
How is it , then , that Paul and Barnabas “ strengthened the disciples ” with a message that pointed to more tribulation ?
Indeed , Jesus stated : “ The one who has endured to the end will be saved . ” ​ — Matt .
If we endure , we will have a reward .
Not at all . ​ — Read Acts 20 : 22 , 23 .
Paul bravely stood up to Satan’s frontal attacks and stated : “ I do not consider my own life of any importance to me , if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus , to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God . ”
For example , in one country some Witnesses have endured almost 20 years of imprisonment because of maintaining their neutrality .
Our brothers elsewhere endure tribulations that arise suddenly .
5 : 8 , 9 .
Subtle attacks are more like a colony of termites that slowly creep in and nibble away at the wood of your house until it collapses .
One of the most effective subtle tactics Satan uses is discouragement .
For example , a zealous pioneer whom we will call Deborah says : “ Over and over again , I think about a mistake I’ve made , feeling worse about it each time .
Really , who wants us to get so discouraged that we give up ?
Who wants you to feel the same weighty condemnation that looms over him ?
Make no mistake , God’s people are involved in spiritual warfare !
Keep focused on the reward .

Am I submissive to those taking the lead in the local congregation and to those responsible for doing so in the worldwide congregation ? ’
They have learned not to be timid or embarrassed about their beliefs .
Rather , they speak up with boldness .
( b ) What should be our determination regarding tribulations ?
We are ever closer to the glorious day when God’s Kingdom will establish peace and restore all faithful humans to perfection .
Be determined to enter into that Kingdom ​ — even if through many tribulations .
What is involved in parents ’ being like shepherds ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What were some of the responsibilities of an Israelite shepherd ?
SHEPHERDS in ancient Israel led a rigorous life .
They have the responsibility to raise their children “ in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah . ”
No !
Children are faced with an onslaught of satanic propaganda as well as with their own imperfect inclinations .
Your children may react similarly if they come to you for advice but all you have on the “ menu ” is a list of stern warnings .
This has helped me to feel comfortable talking to them about it .
In line with what Kayla said , you can show that you are approachable by patiently listening to your children .
“ In the past , ” admits a single mother named Katia , “ I was very impatient with my daughter .
Listen so as to know them ( See paragraphs 3 - 9 )
“ When she told me that she was in love with a boy at school , at first I was very angry , ” he says .

How can you help your children not to drift away ?
Perhaps it is attracted by grass a short distance away and then to some a bit farther away , thus separating itself from the flock .
How can you help to prevent such a situation from developing ?
When teaching your children , act quickly if you recognize potential weak spots .
In outlining this arrangement , the October 2008 Kingdom Ministry stated : “ Family heads are encouraged to shoulder their responsibility before Jehovah to ensure that a meaningful , regular program of family Bible study is followed . ”
As we do this , we are bonding and creating good memories .
As a parent , do you not have a similar goal spiritually ?
In what ways might parents help their children make the truth their own ?
How ?
If we need to study the Bible Teach and “ God’s Love ” books with interested ones , how much more so with our own children !
Help him or her to reason on such questions as : “ How do I know that God exists ?
Why do I believe that Jehovah’s standards are truly for my good ? ”
For more suggestions , see The Watchtower , August 1 , 2008 , pages 10 - 12 .

“ Jehovah God also gave this command to the man : ‘ From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction . But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ’ ” ​ — Gen .
2 : 16 , 17 .
For them to eat of the tree would be to claim moral independence , which would cause enormous damage to them and to the offspring they would produce .
The one behind the serpent was Satan the Devil , a spirit son of God who had allowed himself to nurture a desire for independence and personal power .
To achieve his evil ends , he accused God of lying . He assured Eve that reaching out for independence would result , not in death , but in becoming like God .
6 , 7 .


After violating God’s command , he could have expected Jehovah to act before the sun set .
“ About the breezy part of the day , ” Jehovah approached the couple .
He held court , as it were , establishing the facts from the responses that Adam and Eve gave .
( See opening image . )
Then Adam’s other offspring grew old and died .
Did they inherit sin as well as death ?
Sin and death inherited from Adam thus became implacable enemies of mankind , inescapable for imperfect humans .
7 : 24 .
Directly after mentioning “ the shroud , ” Isaiah wrote : “ He will swallow up death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Human imperfection and death involve both the sin Adam committed and Jehovah’s righteous judgment .
What could Jehovah do to remove his condemnatory judgment without invalidating his own standards ?
As a perfect man , Jesus had prospects similar to those of Adam before he sinned .
Hence , with deep love for his Father and for Adam’s descendants , Jesus gave up his human life in sacrifice .
Yes , Jesus gave up a perfect human life that corresponded to what Adam had lost .
Jehovah could justly accept the sacrifice of that one perfect man , Jesus , as a ransom , or purchase price , to buy back Adam’s family and give them the life prospects that Adam had forfeited .
15 : 45 .
Why ?
Jehovah provided for a Kingdom government made up of “ the last Adam ” and chosen associates from among mankind .
Those associated with Jesus in heaven will have experienced what it means to be imperfect .
But each one in his own proper order : Christ the firstfruits , afterward those who belong to the Christ [ his joint rulers ] during his presence .
The purpose of the Son’s rule will have been accomplished .
He will then , with deep satisfaction , return his authority to Jehovah and present to him the perfected human family .
“ The second death ” is , however , no enemy of humans who love and serve their Creator .
The commission given to Adam will have been accomplished without him .
The earth will abound with his offspring , who will delight to oversee it and enjoy its many life forms .
“ We continually remember your faithful work , your loving labor . ” ​ — 1 THESS .
Paul wrote : “ We continually remember your faithful work , your loving labor , and your endurance because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father . ”
Many of our fellow servants ​ — past and present — ​ have made great sacrifices to serve Jehovah full - time .
Paul and his traveling companions also worked part - time to help cover their own expenses .
( See the box “ Fields of Full - Time Service . ” )
We have felt Jehovah’s protection and direction over and over again and in ways that would never have happened had we stayed in our own little comfort zone .
We can be confident that Jehovah values their whole - souled efforts as well .
Another sister who was able to pioneer for some years said about the pioneers in her congregation : “ They work hard and endlessly .
What have some done to help pioneers in their congregation ?
Would you like to help the pioneers in the ministry ?
You might invite single brothers or sisters to your family worship from time to time .

Like regular pioneers , special pioneers appreciate having companions in the field ministry .
Circuit overseers and their wives deeply appreciate the personal interest their brothers and sisters show .
If your congregation or circuit includes Bethelites , how can you show that you remember them ?
Their normal work schedule allows them to attend congregation meetings and to have a share in the field service each week .
The branch office provides missionaries with modest lodging and an allowance to cover their basic needs .
Full - time servants age , and so do their parents .
Still , those back home may help those in the full - time ministry by being ready to provide care if aging parents need assistance .
Those who enter the full - time ministry do so , not to gain financially , but to give ​ — to Jehovah and to others .
It is challenging , instructive , and fulfilling . And it is fine preparation for the long - lasting joyful service that awaits all faithful servants of Jehovah under God’s Kingdom .
Regular pioneers usually dedicate 70 hours a month to the field ministry , serving in their home congregation or in localities where the need is greater .
Many missionaries dedicate 130 hours a month to the field ministry .
Fernando listened as one of the elders spoke to him .
The brother repeated what he had said , and a smile appeared on Fernando’s face .
That may make you think of a person straining to grasp an attractive piece of fruit hanging from a tree .
Speaking and teaching are important , but those abilities do not override the need to be irreprehensible , moderate in habits , sound in mind , orderly , hospitable , and reasonable . ”
He brings comfort and assistance to the sick and the elderly because he is a lover of goodness .
If you wish to serve as an elder some day , be hardworking and trustworthy in all aspects of sacred service .
A number of brothers wait what seems to them to be a long time before they are appointed .
Jehovah reassured him that His promise regarding a son would come true .
But at least 14 more years passed before God carried out his word . ​ — Gen .
15 : 2 - 4 ; 16 : 16 ; 21 : 5 .
He never doubted God’s promise .
He continued to look forward to a good outcome .
Warren , who has helped many brothers to make spiritual progress , explains why : “ The process of qualifying for an appointment follows a progression .
Some believe that they are successful only if they get this privilege or that appointment .
If you hope to do the fine work of a Christian overseer some day , reach out by contributing to the happiness of the congregation .
Those who are always anxious miss the rich joy that comes from serving Jehovah . ”
As you strive to develop the needed qualities and work hard in the congregation while not neglecting your family , you will establish a record of service that will not be forgotten .

Why Be Interested in God’s Kingdom ?
God’s Kingdom ​ — What Will It Mean for You ?
( Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED )
Millions of people around the world rest their hope on God’s Kingdom .
Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible .
COVER SUBJECT | GOD’S KINGDOM ​ — WHAT CAN IT MEAN FOR YOU ?
But the subject that Jesus spoke about more than any other ​ — the subject closest to his heart — ​ was God’s Kingdom . ​ — Luke 6 : 45 .
He exerted himself , walking hundreds of miles throughout the land of Israel in order to teach people about God’s Kingdom .
Primarily , Jesus was and is interested in God’s Kingdom * because of what it will do for those whom he loves ​ — his heavenly Father and his faithful followers .
By means of the Kingdom , God will eliminate all human suffering .
Long before he came to earth , Jesus lived in heaven with his Father .
The Father used the Son to bring everything into existence ​ — from the mind - boggling heavens with their countless stars and galaxies to our beautiful planet and the wildlife that inhabits it .
But Jesus did more than talk about helping people .
Time and again , he demonstrated his love for humans .
No more health problems .
“ There is going to be a resurrection . ” ​ — Acts 24 : 15 .
No more homelessness or unemployment .
When you consider those promises regarding God’s Kingdom , can you see why the Kingdom means so much to Jesus ?
If so , how can you learn more about that Kingdom ?
This article refers to Jesus ’ feelings in the present tense because Jesus is alive in heaven , and since his return to heaven , the Kingdom has undoubtedly remained close to his heart . ​ — Luke 24 : 51 .
At the same time , you may wonder if such promises are too good to be true .
In time , they became convinced that the good news was in fact solidly based on God’s Word .
By means of our free Bible study program , we offer you the opportunity to compare what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe about God’s Kingdom with what the Bible teaches .
Where did we come from ?
What happens when we die ?
Will the earth be destroyed ?
In turn , the closer you draw to God , the more you will see how God’s Kingdom can mean good things for you ​ — not just now but forever .
Jesus himself said in prayer to his Father : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

Recently , a ten - year - old girl named Folake was assigned to write an essay for school on the subject “ What I Love Most in This World . ”
“ But it’s invisible , so you can’t see it ​ — even if you wear glasses ! ”
Folake said that she also looks forward to the time when God , by means of his Kingdom , will do away with all sickness .
* The last time we spoke , you raised a question about God’s Kingdom .
You asked why Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the Kingdom began ruling in the year 1914 .
That made me curious because you say that you base all of your beliefs on the Bible .
First , that you’ve read through the entire Bible .
You must really love God’s Word .
Jon : I do .
There’s nothing like it .
You did exactly what the Bible encourages us to do : “ Keep searching ” for understanding .
Cameron : Ah , yes .
Cameron : Actually , Jon , even the prophet Daniel didn’t understand the full meaning of what he was inspired to record !
So these prophecies would only be understood much later , during “ the time of the end . ”
Cameron : I’ll do my best .
Then we can talk about what it means .
During that time , he was unable to rule as king .
But what does all of this have to do with God’s Kingdom and the year 1914 ?
The second fulfillment involved an interruption of God’s rulership .
Did you notice the expression “ the kingdom of mankind ” ?
Cameron : Time and again , the Bible book of Daniel develops a central theme .
Jon : No , I guess not .
Cameron : That’s right .
In other words , this Kingdom would have global rulership .
Jon : Yes , it does .
Cameron : Let’s briefly review what we’ve discussed so far .
Cameron : Well , let’s go back to King Nebuchadnezzar .
Cameron : So 607 B.C.E . marked the beginning of the seven times , or the period when God’s rulership would be interrupted .
The seven times started hundreds of years before Jesus came to earth , and they continued until sometime after he returned to heaven .
Remember , too , that the meaning of the prophecies in Daniel was not to become clear until “ the time of the end . ”
They began to discern that the seven times would end in the year 1914 .
And major world events since then confirm that 1914 was indeed the year that God’s Kingdom began ruling in heaven .
Now , I know this is probably a lot to digest . . .
Would you like to examine that topic the next time I’m here ?
Daniel 4 : 13 - 17 .
Daniel 12 : 9 .
As told by Christof Bauer
YEAR BORN : 1951
For the first few years of my life , my family lived near Leipzig , East Germany , not far from the Czech and Polish borders .
At age 14 , I was sent to a boarding school in Germany .
After observing various lifestyles and movements , I became convinced that the best thing I could do with my life was to use it to explore this beautiful planet before humanity destroys it .
Soon , though , I had to return to Europe for repairs to my motorcycle .
Shortly thereafter , I found myself on a beach in Portugal .
I joined a group of young people who were preparing to sail across the Atlantic Ocean .
It was at this point ​ — after my military service but before finishing the vessel — ​ that we were contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses and began to study the Bible .
My life was all about me .
For example , he said that happiness belongs to those who are hungry and thirsty .
It is as Jesus said : “ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . ” ​ — Matthew 5 : 3 .
Wherever we went , we found Jehovah’s Witnesses .
In time , Laurie and I were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He was a perfect man with abilities far beyond anything I could imagine , yet he never promoted himself .
His life was not about himself but about his heavenly Father .
I saw that I needed to put God’s Kingdom first in my life
When Laurie and I finally reached land in the United States , we decided to settle down there and focus on our worship .
It’s not that our life has always been smooth sailing .
Do you want to know more about God’s Kingdom and what it will accomplish ?
Jesus is an ideal King because he is compassionate .
As God’s Son , he also has the power to provide help for all who cry to God for aid . ​ — Read Psalm 72 : 8 , 12 - 14 .

In these last days , the challenges to our faith are many .
This study will help us to endure by encouraging us to keep our minds fixed on Jehovah God and his Kingdom .

At that same convention , a missionary couple serving in Taiwan were interviewed .
A scripture that helped them to make that “ jump ” was Ecclesiastes 11 : 4 , which states : “ The one who watches the wind will not sow seed , and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap . ”
So you’re already having an important share in the ministry ! ”
That encouraging comment greatly helped Brian and Michelle not to give up .
And indeed , they progressed and are proving to be effective pioneers today .
What may motivate you to take on the task of learning a foreign language ?
Go to the meetings , associate with the local brothers and sisters , and accompany them in the preaching work .
Says Brian : “ After you observe that so many respond favorably to the Kingdom message and you experience the warm love of the brothers and sisters , you will be moved to take on the challenges of serving in a foreign land . ”
This part - time job enables him to support himself and his wife financially , and it leaves them enough time to spend in their primary activity ​ — the pioneer ministry , fishing for men .
“ Since the fishermen are in port only for a short time , we start a Bible study with them right then and there .
She mentioned her concerns in prayer to Jehovah and wrote letters to several branch offices , inquiring about the possible dangers for single sisters .
In 2004 , at age 31 , Cathy moved to Taiwan , where she lives as simply as she can .
She explains why : “ I am able to preach in an area where many people respond to the good news .
When she arrived in Taiwan , there were two Chinese congregations in the city where she began serving as a pioneer , but today there are seven congregations .
Says Cathy : “ To see close up such amazing growth and to share in bringing in the harvest makes my daily life buzz with excitement ! ”
Choong Keon initially felt that his limited Chinese made him of little use in the congregation .
“ At that moment , I really felt that I was serving where the need was greater .
In many lands , there is still a need for more workers in the spiritual harvest .
Are you retired , having a lifetime of valuable experience to share with others ?
You can be sure that rich blessings await you if you decide to expand your ministry by serving where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers .
Using the chart “ How God Will Accomplish His Purpose , ” review . . .
the Edenic promise .
the Abrahamic covenant and the Davidic covenant .
the covenant for a priest like Melchizedek .
The Kingdom is based on an unshakable foundation ​ — Jehovah’s absolute right to rule .

He tempted the first woman , Eve , to disobey the prohibition regarding the tree of the knowledge of good and bad .
But it would also mean that God’s expressed purpose to have the earth filled with obedient descendants of Adam and Eve would go unfulfilled .
Who would the woman’s offspring prove to be ?
This is the earliest recorded account of the Abrahamic covenant ​ — the covenant that Jehovah God made with Abraham .
( a ) How did Abraham demonstrate unshakable faith in God’s promises ?
And when Abraham demonstrated unshakable faith in God’s promises by showing willingness to offer up his only son , Jehovah reinforced the covenant with an unconditional promise .
Abraham demonstrated his unshakable faith in God’s promises ( See paragraph 10 )
While the Abrahamic covenant had a literal fulfillment for the descendants of Abraham when they inherited the Promised Land , the Scriptures show that the terms of that covenant also have a spiritual fulfillment .
The woman producing the offspring is none other than “ the Jerusalem above ” ​ — the heavenly part of God’s organization , made up of loyal spirit creatures .
How long will this covenant stay in effect ?
In fact , those who will then live on earth will benefit in an everlasting way .
13 , 14 .
The Edenic promise and the Abrahamic covenant establish the vital point that Jehovah’s sovereignty as expressed through the Messianic Kingdom is solidly based on God’s righteous standards .
This clearly shows that Jehovah has legally bound himself to use the Messianic Kingdom to accomplish his original purpose concerning humans on earth .
The Edenic promise binds Jehovah to fulfill his purpose regarding the earth and mankind by means of the offspring of the woman .
PARTIES : Jehovah and Abraham
PURPOSE : It forms a legal basis for the “ offspring ” of “ the woman ” of Genesis 3 : 15 to rule in the Kingdom
THE first prophecy recorded in the Bible is of great significance in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose .
With cunning they secretly plot against your people ; they conspire against your treasured ones .
They say : ‘ Come , let us annihilate them as a nation . ’ ”
Through Moses , Jehovah concluded a unique national covenant with them by giving them the Law , and the nation of Israel agreed to the terms of that covenant .
Jehovah now became ‘ their Judge , their Lawgiver , and their King . ’
Since the Law forbade intermarrying with pagans and participation in false worship , it was designed to prevent Abraham’s line of descent from being contaminated . ​ — Ex .
In fact , through that covenant , Israel had a unique opportunity and privilege to become “ a kingdom of priests , ” provided they met the stipulation to obey Jehovah’s laws .
The Law was to protect the offspring and lead humans to the Messiah .
The question , though , remains : Who would then have the opportunity to become a kingdom of priests ?
He could also adopt certain devoted humans “ as sons ” by anointing them with holy spirit .
Concerning the “ joint heirs with Christ , ” the apostle Peter stated : “ You are ‘ a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for special possession , that you should declare abroad the excellencies ’ of the One who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light . ”
Moreover , the holy spirit needed to be poured out on those who would be “ joint heirs with Christ . ”
Hence , the new covenant went into effect at Pentecost 33 C.E . when Jesus ’ loyal disciples were anointed with holy spirit .
The Law covenant was validated by means of animal blood ; the new covenant was validated by the shed blood of Jesus .
( b ) What is necessary for spiritual Israel to be able to rule with Christ in heaven ?
What does the Kingdom covenant make possible for anointed Christians ?
We thus have powerful reason to put our full trust in the Messianic Kingdom as the instrument that God is using to make his original purpose for the earth and mankind a reality . ​ — Rev .
LIFE STORY
As told by Mildred Olson
While the brothers were having their weekly Watchtower Study , boys threw large stones through the open door of the missionary home .
For two hours , they pelted the building with stones and chanted : “ Long live the Virgin ! ”
and , “ May Jehovah die ! ”
*
Soon my parents began to study with Jehovah’s Witnesses and learned what the Bible really teaches about life after death .
In 1943 , I was assigned to pioneer in Portland , Oregon .
We graduated on January 22 , 1945 .
We widely advertised the public talk and were overjoyed to have nearly 500 in attendance .
They appreciated our efforts to learn Spanish so that we could teach them about the true God , Jehovah , and about his precious promise of the restoration of Paradise on earth .
*
When she reopened her store after a few hours , customers flocked in to buy .
She experienced firsthand the truth of Matthew 6 : 33 and was faithful until her death .
On one occasion , the local priest visited the man who rented a house to six of us missionaries and warned him that if he continued to rent to us , he and his wife would be excommunicated .
He assured us that we were welcome to stay as long as we wanted .
In the capital city , San Salvador , another missionary was studying the Bible with the wife of an engineer named Baltasar Perla .
I did not recognize him and was curious .
Now he was serving Jehovah with me !
That conversation confirmed for me that the full - time ministry is the most rewarding career anyone could choose .
In 1975 , after much prayerful thought , I decided to leave my missionary assignment and return to Spokane . My faithful , aging parents needed my assistance .
She lived for eight more years , dying at the age of 94 .
It is as Jehovah said , “ until your hair is gray . . . , I will carry you and bear you and rescue you . ” ​ — Isa .
Since I am the only elderly Witness here , the brothers and sisters have kindly “ adopted ” me as their “ grandmother . ”
My favorite scripture is Psalm 145 : 16 , which assures us that Jehovah will “ satisfy the desire of every living thing . ”
Despite Satan’s unrelenting opposition , there are now over 39,000 publishers in that country .
3 : 9 .

To stress the urgency of such works , Jesus explained : “ We must do the works of the One who sent me while it is day ; the night is coming when no man can work . ” ​ — John 9 : 4 .
Even prior to Jesus ’ day , humans were given fulfilling work to do .
Still , the work they have been assigned has always glorified Jehovah and benefited believing mankind .
Similarly , the work assigned to us today glorifies Jehovah .
You will agree that it is amazing that Jehovah has invited imperfect humans to have the honor of serving as his fellow workers .
Those who are involved in building Assembly Halls , Kingdom Halls , and branch facilities are taking part in a physical building program , as did Noah and Moses .
Whether you are working to renovate a local Kingdom Hall or to build our world headquarters at Warwick , New York , cherish your privilege to serve in this way .
However , for the most part , Christians are invited to engage in a spiritual building program .
It too is designed to glorify Jehovah and to benefit obedient humans .
A strong desire to accomplish Jehovah’s will is seen in the way the elders take the lead in the congregation .
Michael reports : “ We had not engaged in this form of service for several years , so we had butterflies in our stomach .
What organizational adjustments have been made in recent times ?
Though such changes require that the brothers and sisters serving at these branches make adjustments , before long the advantages of the changes become clear to all involved .
What a joy it is for such willing workers to play a part in the ongoing history of Jehovah’s people !
A couple who served in a small Bethel family in Central America were asked to join a Bethel family almost 30 times as large in Mexico .
For those moving to another country , this meant getting used to new living accommodations , working with brothers and sisters they did not know , and possibly having to learn to do a different type of work .
Making such changes can be difficult .
Why have they done so ?
Grethel says : “ I accepted the invitation because it was my way of showing Jehovah that my love for him went beyond a country , a building , or a certain privilege . ”
We told ourselves , ‘ When faced with Jehovah’s winds of change , it is better to set your sails than to build barriers . ’ ”
Even though most of us may never have to make such adjustments , can we not imitate the willingness of these brothers and sisters to put Kingdom interests first ?
Most of us have no position of authority within the organization .
These are fine privileges , to be sure !
Remember , every person who praises Jehovah’s name is precious in his eyes !
6 : 18 , 19 .
3 : 2 .
Some within the congregation were creating divisions by promoting adherence to the Mosaic Law .
If those anointed Christians focused their minds on “ the elementary things of the world , ” they would be turning their backs on Jehovah’s provision for salvation .
In order to help them safeguard their precious relationship with God , Paul admonished them : “ Keep your minds fixed on the things above , not on the things on the earth . ”
How can we examine our thinking about materialistic pursuits ?
Or do I strive to maintain an eye that is focused on spiritual matters ? ’
7 , 8 . ( a ) What problems did Abraham and Sarah face ?
How will following Abraham’s example encourage us to keep busy in God’s service ?
If so , you are to be commended .
What about now ?
Moses highly esteemed the knowledge of Jehovah and considered it to be of greater value than any other riches .
Moses was given the best secular education that was available in his day , but did he use it to advance his career in Egypt , make a name for himself , or acquire material possessions ?
Moses needed training that would prepare him to endure the trials and hardships that lay ahead .
A few decades as a shepherd would provide the training he needed to cultivate these godly qualities .
Did Moses learn from the practical training he received as a shepherd ?
He had cultivated humility , which helped him to deal patiently with a variety of people and their difficult problems .
2 : 17 .
( b ) Why is it important for Christians to maintain good conduct ?
True , as imperfect humans , we all make mistakes .
He was humble .
The following is a typical conversation that one of Jehovah’s Witnesses might have with a neighbor .
Let us imagine that a Witness named Cameron has returned to the home of a man named Jon .
Jon : I’ve been fine , thanks .
Cameron : I’m glad you’re doing well .
Jon : It was King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a big tree .
He heard a messenger of God command that the tree be cut down , but its stump and roots were to be left in the ground .
After a period of “ seven times , ” the tree would grow again .
Cameron : Precisely .
Jon : How long ?
* Thus , seven times ​ — twice the amount of three and a half times — ​ would equal 2,520 days .
* If we apply the rule of a day for a year , the seven times would amount to 2,520 years .
Counting forward from 607 B.C.E . , 2,520 years takes us to the year 1914 .
And significantly , since 1914 , major world events have happened ​ — events that the Bible foretold for the last days .
Jon : True .
But at the very least , I hope our discussion has helped you to see that even though the year 1914 isn’t specifically mentioned in the Bible , Jehovah’s Witnesses do base their beliefs about that year on the Scriptures .
Jon : Yes , I’ve always been impressed with this about you ​ — no matter what you say , you back it up with a scripture .
It’s never just your opinion .
Do you have a particular Bible subject that you have wondered about ?
See Daniel 4 : 23 - 25 .
See Revelation 6 : 4 .

We Must Be Holy in All Our Conduct
▪ The Resurrection of Jesus ​ — Its Meaning for Us
These articles , based largely on the book of Leviticus , show why Jehovah requires holiness of his people and how we can display this quality .
Also considered are ways to prove ourselves holy in all our conduct .
31 From Our Archives
28 : 6 .
Peter had healed a man who had been lame from birth , and they wanted to know by what power or in whose name Peter had done this .
Holy spirit played a vital role , but so did Peter’s certainty that Jesus had been resurrected .
And why can we share that conviction ?
On another occasion , Jesus resurrected a 12 - year - old girl .
The apostles knew that Jesus ’ resurrection was different from the resurrections that preceded it .
Jesus ’ resurrection was central to Jehovah’s purpose and to the good news they boldly proclaimed far and wide .
( b ) What happened when women came to the tomb ?
27 : 62 - 66 .
When Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb on the third day , they found the stone rolled away and an angel sitting on it .
Jesus was alive !
What proof of Jesus ’ resurrection did Paul provide ?
After that he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time , most of whom are still with us , though some have fallen asleep in death .
15 : 3 - 8 .
A third reason why we know that Jesus ’ resurrection occurred is the zeal that his disciples showed in proclaiming it .
If Jesus had not been raised up ​ — if it was all a hoax — ​ why would Peter risk his life to proclaim Christ’s resurrection to the religious leaders , who hated Jesus and had plotted his death ?
As a result , true Christianity is flourishing .
We have every reason to be fearless , for try as they may , our enemies will never silence us ! Jesus ’ resurrection gives us courage to preach ( See paragraph 15 )
Jesus ’ atoning sacrifice and his resurrection mean that death will be no more .
How does Jesus ’ resurrection testify to God’s greatness ?
What power and wisdom Jehovah exercised in order to raise Jesus to immortal heavenly life !
The tent of God is with mankind , and he will reside with them , and they will be his people .
And God himself will be with them . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . The former things have passed away . ”
1 : 1 ; 21 : 3 - 5 .
IN THE book of Leviticus , holiness is referred to more often than in any other book of the Bible .
The book of Leviticus , written by the prophet Moses , is part of “ all Scripture ” that is beneficial for teaching .
In this article and the next , let us enjoy some sparkling gems found in Leviticus , a gift from God that helps us to engage in holy worship .
3 , 4 .
But what about the “ other sheep ” ? ​ — John 10 : 16 .
So are such baptized individuals also made holy and cleansed by means of God’s Word ?
When those with the earthly hope read what the Bible says about the importance and effectiveness of Jesus ’ shed blood , they put faith in these words and render “ sacred service day and night . ”
How pleased Jehovah must be as he observes the cleanness and the unity of the anointed and the other sheep , who listen to and loyally follow their Shepherd , Jesus !
The requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean has real meaning for Jehovah’s people today .
Then he ought to get help to end that vile practice . ​ — Jas .
In line with Leviticus 8 : 22 - 24 , what example did Jesus set ?
Jesus ’ hands were used in carrying out Jehovah’s will , and his feet never strayed from a holy course . ​ — John 4 : 31 - 34 .
Anointed Christians and Jesus ’ other sheep must follow the integrity - keeping course of their High Priest .
12 : 13 .
How did three brothers who have worked closely with members of the Governing Body express themselves , and how can their statements help you to continue to prove yourself holy ?
The third brother said : “ Loving what Jehovah loves and hating what he hates , as well as constantly seeking his guidance and doing what pleases him , means obedience to his organization and to those he is using to advance his purpose for the earth . ”
Read Leviticus 17 : 10 .
Yes , we expect to be ridiculed for abstaining from blood , but we choose to be obedient to God .
The blood of the bull and the goat was to be spattered toward and before the cover of the ark of the covenant .
This action opened the way for Jehovah to forgive the sins of the Israelites .
No .
When the apostle Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians about the cleansing power of blood , he explained : “ According to the Law nearly all things are cleansed with blood , and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place . ”
How would forgiveness of sins become possible ?
The sacrificial death of Jesus Christ , who willingly ‘ handed himself over for us , ’ has profound meaning for all who love him and his Father .
In like manner , Jesus entered heaven itself with the value of his human blood and presented it to Jehovah .
Why is it important to understand and obey Jehovah’s law regarding blood ?
Therefore , it is very important to do research and prepare for a possible emergency .
By our holy conduct , we prove to him that we deeply appreciate the lifesaving power of Jesus ’ blood ​ — the only blood that makes possible the forgiveness of sin and everlasting life . ​ — John 3 : 16 .
( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )
As Jehovah’s Witnesses , we too must be holy .
The book of Leviticus leaves no doubt about that .
Why is avoiding compromise a serious issue for true Christians ?
What is the connection between Jehovah’s sovereignty and Christian neutrality ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 14 - 16 . )
What can we learn from the offering of sacrifices ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) Why must Christians avoid compromising on Bible laws and principles ?
I am Jehovah . ” ​ — Lev .
Jehovah expects us to refrain from taking vengeance , and he wants us to avoid harboring a grudge .
God has given us the privilege of being “ earthen vessels ” containing the treasure of the ministry .
They must have been devastated when fire from heaven consumed Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu at the tabernacle .
But what if we were invited to attend and participate in a church wedding of a non - Witness relative ?
*
More than 30 times , the laws found in Leviticus are credited to Jehovah .
Moses acknowledged this and did what Jehovah commanded him to do .
29 : 25 .
As followers of Christ and Witnesses of Jehovah , we are persecuted in nations around the world .
Many of these individuals have repented and have regained their relationship with our merciful heavenly Father .
Two years later , one who compromised found himself part of a firing squad assigned to execute the faithful Witnesses .
For example , consider what was required of the mother of a newborn child .
Leviticus 12 : 6 states : “ When the days of her purification for a son or a daughter are completed , she will bring a young ram in its first year for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting , to the priest . ”
God’s requirements were specific , but his loving reasonableness shines radiantly in the Law .
If the mother could not afford a sheep , she was allowed to offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons .
Our sacrifice of praise ​ — our giving praise to Jehovah by making known his name and proclaiming the good news — ​ should be commensurate with our health and ability .
12 : 1 ; 2 Tim .
Jehovah appreciates those minutes as the Kingdom publisher’s best offering and as an expression of love for Him and appreciation for the inestimable privilege of serving as one of His Witnesses .
Just like those Israelites whose circumstances did not allow them to offer some of the more expensive sacrifices , Jehovah’s precious servants who have certain limitations can still submit a report .
You may now be more determined to prove yourself holy , not only because Jehovah requires it but because he deserves your earnest effort to please him .
15 , 16 .
Why was Paul so direct when he wrote to the Hebrew Christians ?
( Read Hebrews 5 : 7 , 11 - 14 . )
Knowing the fundamental doctrines of Christianity is vital .
However , “ solid food ” is needed to promote spiritual growth toward Christian maturity .
( b ) With regard to Christian meetings , how may we view the use of alcoholic beverages ?
Four cups of wine were used at the Passover .
Draw ever closer to him .
But does this thinking represent God’s ?
Rulers in Canaan considered him to be “ a great chieftain ” and treated him with respect .
How did Abraham’s descendants develop as a people ?
In time , these were to become the patriarchal heads of the 12 tribes of Israel .
Jacob’s descendants became very numerous , “ a congregation of peoples . ” ​ — Gen . 48 : 4 ; read Acts 7 : 17 .
They had been warmly welcomed by Pharaoh , who knew and appreciated Joseph .

So he said to his people : ‘ Look !
1 : 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 .
Pharaoh even decreed that all Hebrew male babies should be put to death at their birth .
Thus , Moses and Aaron were instructed to say to Pharaoh : “ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says , ‘ Send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness . ’ ” ​ — Ex .
9 , 10 . ( a ) According to Deuteronomy 4 : 5 - 8 , how did the Law set the Israelites apart from other peoples ?
These family heads , like the servants of Jehovah who lived before them , acted as rulers , judges , and priests to their households .
( Read Deuteronomy 4 : 5 - 8 ; Ps .
The Law established a separate priesthood , and justice was administered by “ the elders , ” who were respected for their knowledge and wisdom .
At the time of the seventh plague , some “ among Pharaoh’s servants ” feared Jehovah’s word and doubtless became a part of the mixed company that left Egypt with the Israelites . ​ — Ex .
9 : 20 .
These foreign residents became proselytes , and the males submitted to circumcision .
43 : 9 .
In what would amount to a universal court case over the issue “ Who is the Supreme God ? , ” Jehovah’s chosen people were to attest loud and clear that Jehovah is the one true God .
They were the people who bore his name .
2 : 21 , 28 , 32 .
( b ) What will be examined in the following article ?
Of the spiritual Israelites who would be brought into that new covenant , Jehovah had prophesied : “ I will become their God , and they will become my people . ” ​ — Jer .
After fleshly Israel proved unfaithful , Jehovah made spiritual Israel his people in the first century , as already noted .
For the first time since the days of Abraham , God’s people would no longer be identified by the fleshly circumcision of their males .
Instead , regarding each member of that new nation , Paul wrote : “ His circumcision is that of the heart by spirit . ” ​ — Rom .


( b ) What successive steps contributed to the growth of Jehovah’s new nation during the early years of its existence ?
This occurred when he preached to the Roman centurion Cornelius and his relatives and friends .
This new people bearing Jehovah’s name would include both Jewish and non - Jewish believers .
They bore witness to Jehovah and to Jesus “ in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the most distant part of the earth . ” ​ — Acts 1 : 8 ; Col .
1 : 23 .
Thus , for centuries , Jehovah had just a sprinkling of faithful worshippers on the earth but no organized “ people for his name . ”
“ The conclusion of the system of things ” began in 1914 .
In 1919 , Jehovah delivered them , making a clear distinction between them and “ the weeds , ” or imitation Christians .
Or will a nation be born all at once ?
Yet , as soon as Zion went into labor , she gave birth to her sons . ”
The flocking of many humans to worship Jehovah with his people in this time of the end was foretold by two ancient prophets .
In what work do the “ other sheep ” “ go with ” the spiritual Israelites ?
At that time , Gog will attack “ a people regathered from the nations , ” Jehovah’s people .
Jehovah will magnify his sovereignty and sanctify his name , for he says : “ I will certainly . . . make myself known before the eyes of many nations ; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah . ” ​ — Ezek .
17 , 18 . ( a ) When Gog attacks Jehovah’s people , what instructions will they receive ?
( b ) If we want Jehovah’s protection , what must we do ?
Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by . ”
At that crucial time , Jehovah will give us lifesaving instructions , and the “ inner rooms ” might well be connected with our local congregations .
First , holy spirit moved the Bible writers to record the qualifications for elders and ministerial servants .
Third , the individual being recommended needs to display the fruitage of God’s holy spirit in his own life .
In the past , all recommendations involving the appointment of elders and ministerial servants were sent to the local branch office .
There , brothers appointed by the Governing Body were assigned to review these recommendations and to make appropriate appointments .
Years later , Paul wrote to his traveling companion Titus , saying : “ I left you in Crete so that you would correct the things that were defective and make appointments of elders in city after city , as I instructed you . ”
In turn , each branch office provides practical assistance in implementing the direction given .
13 : 7 , 17 .
Provides practical assistance in implementing the direction of the Governing Body .
11 : 7 , 11 .
Who are these two witnesses ?
The details of the account help us to identify them .
However , true to the words of the prophecy , at the end of the three and a half days , the two witnesses were brought back to life .
Malachi chapter 3 mentions a similar inspection of the spiritual temple , followed by a time of cleansing .
Additionally , we appreciate the example set by the faithful anointed ones who took the lead during that time of testing and thereby served as the symbolic two witnesses .
For more information , see The Watchtower of July 15 , 2013 , page 22 , paragraph 12 .
A total of 36 attended , and 8 were baptized .
On the day of the talk , two airplanes flew over the city , scattering 100,000 handbills .
In October 1927 , the Bible Students arranged talks in Tokyo .
Three Great Jehus each measured 7.2 feet ( 2.2 m ) long , 6.2 feet ( 1.9 m ) wide , and 6.2 feet ( 1.9 m ) high and each could accommodate up to six pioneers .
Colporteurs were shining the light of truth throughout Japan , pushing and pulling Jehus up and down mountains and across valleys from northerly Hokkaido to Kyushu in the south . A Baby Jehu accommodated two

And if so , how ? ’
It generally starts with two people getting to know each other’s names .
Consider this : God’s name , written with four Hebrew consonants known as the Tetragrammaton , appears in the original text of the Hebrew Scriptures nearly 7,000 times .

The Bible shows that God pays special attention to “ those meditating on [ or possibly , “ treasuring ” ] his name . ”
COVER SUBJECT | YOU CAN BE CLOSE TO GOD
We can speak to Jehovah by means of prayer .
This should move us to pray with a deep sense of respect and reverence .
Second , prayers must be offered in the name of God’s Son , Jesus Christ .
After reading it , you might excitedly tell others , “ I’ve just heard from my friend ! ”
For more information on how to draw close to God in prayer , see chapter 17 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
The Bible shows that Jehovah regularly does what he knows will bring pleasure to his worshippers .
More than that , Jehovah even does what is pleasing to those who do not yet know him , ‘ satisfying them with food and filling their hearts with gladness . ’ ​ — Acts 14 : 17 .
But what specifically can you do to please God ?
So how can you acquire the faith that God looks for in those whom he draws close to himself ?
Then , as you go on increasing in accurate knowledge of Jehovah and applying what you learn of his righteous requirements , your faith in him will grow and he will draw ever closer to you . ​ — Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 .

He also had countless spiritual children .
Among other matters , he spoke of Brother Pierce’s heavenly hope and read Jesus ’ words : “ In the house of my Father are many dwelling places . . . .
Eventually , “ the goods were enough for all the work to be done , and more than enough . ” ​ — Ex .
35 : 21 - 24 , 27 - 29 ; 36 : 7 .
What brought Jehovah the most pleasure was , not the material offerings , but the willing spirit of those who thus supported pure worship .
In fact , God filled Bezalel and Oholiab with the skill needed to do all the work that was commissioned . ​ — Ex .
When Jehovah invited the Israelites to make a donation , he had full confidence that “ everyone with a willing heart ” would support true worship .
In turn , he unstintingly blessed the willinghearted with guidance and boundless joy .
Each month , congregations forward these contributions to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses that serves their country .
Donations via electronic bank transfer , debit card , or credit card .
Donations of cash with the condition that it can be returned if needed by the donor .
To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses through some form of charitable giving , a brochure entitled Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide has been prepared in English and Spanish .

He may even note the tone of voice .
However , not all of them understood the meaning of his words .
Why did many fail to understand the meaning of what Jesus said ?
We need to follow the example of Jesus ’ humble disciples .
He said of them : “ Happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear . ”
( Read Matthew 13 : 11 , 12 . )
This leads to knowledge .
So you jump out of the way of the bus ​ — that is wisdom !
3 : 21 , 22 ; 1 Tim .
4 : 16 .
In this article and the following , we will examine seven illustrations that Jesus used .
As we do so , we will ask the following questions : What does the illustration mean ?
( This leads to understanding . )
How can we use this information to help ourselves as well as others ?
What is the meaning of the illustration of the mustard grain ?
However , within a few decades , the congregation grew rapidly .
It expanded beyond all expectations .
In the same year that Brother Skinner arrived in India , the work had just started in Zambia .
Why did Jesus use the illustration about the leaven ?
Why did Jesus use this illustration ?
But there is change ​ — not just change with regard to numbers but also change in the personality of those who accept this pervasive message . ​ — Rom .
4 : 22 , 23 .
The oldest boy , just 12 years of age at the time , was extremely shy and often tried to hide before the study began .
But they were able to visit this town 25 years later .
A congregation of 69 publishers , 13 of whom were regular pioneers , all meeting in a new Kingdom Hall .
And what about the shy boy ?
He now serves as the coordinator of the body of elders !
Just like the leaven in Jesus ’ illustration , the Kingdom message had grown and changed the lives of many ​ — much to the joy of the visiting couple !
The Kingdom message reached there in 1910 , and Brother Russell visited Cuba in 1913 .
* ​ — Eccl .
How can we benefit from what Jesus taught us in the illustration of the leaven ?
When we meditate on the meaning of Jesus ’ illustration , we realize that there is no need for us to be overly concerned about how the Kingdom message will reach the millions who have not yet heard it .
6 : 18 - 20 .
40 : 5 ; Zech .
Why did Jesus give the illustrations about the traveling merchant and the hidden treasure ?
The deeper our heartfelt joy about finding the truth , the stronger our determination to keep it first in our life will be .
May we show that we have listened and really understood the meaning of these Kingdom illustrations .
In the next article , we will consider three more illustrations and see what lessons we can learn from them .

the prodigal son ?
How did Jesus strengthen his disciples on the day of his resurrection ?
IT WAS still the day of Jesus ’ resurrection . Two of the disciples were walking to a village about seven miles ( 11.2 km ) from Jerusalem .
Not knowing that Jesus had been resurrected , they were heavyhearted because of recent events .
“ Starting with Moses and all the Prophets , he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures . ”
However , his apostles were terrified . Doubts came up in their hearts .
How did Jesus strengthen them ?
As in a normal routine of life , the sower “ sleeps at night and rises up by day . ”
In a similar way , spiritual growth occurs gradually and in stages .
Just like the man in the illustration , we do not know how the growth takes place .
It often goes unnoticed by us as we go about our normal , daily activities .
What should we acknowledge with regard to spiritual growth ?
Modesty on our part will help us to avoid the temptation to pressure or force a student to get baptized .

Anything less would not be acceptable to Jehovah . ​ — Ps .
51 : 12 ; 54 : 6 ; 110 : 3 .
We need to be patient .
So we should not judge the effectiveness of our ministry merely by the results .
Jesus likened the preaching of the Kingdom message to all mankind to the lowering of a large dragnet into the sea .
After reading Matthew 13 : 47 - 50 , consider a modern - day application
Rather , it highlights what would happen during the last days of this wicked system .
Others have been willing to study the Bible with us but are not willing to make a commitment .
How can we benefit from the illustration of the dragnet ?
Understanding the lesson of this illustration helps us to avoid being overly distraught or disappointed if a Bible student or one of our children does not make the truth his own .
This may happen despite all our best efforts .
Or if someone fails to dedicate his life to Jehovah , will he be forever classified as someone “ unsuitable ” ?
No .
By leaving , it is as if they travel to “ a distant country , ” Satan’s world , which is alienated from Jehovah .
Some later come to their senses , however , and make the challenging journey back to Jehovah’s organization .
When he caught sight of his son returning , even though “ he was still a long way off , ” the father acted quickly to welcome him back .
What a strong incentive for those who have left the truth to return to Jehovah without delay !
If we meet a person who has strayed from the congregation , will we offer loving and practical help to assist him to return ?
First , we have to acknowledge that we have no control over spiritual growth .
And if they do return , let us welcome them in a way that reflects Jehovah’s viewpoint .
Our love for Jehovah moved us to dedicate our life to him and get baptized .
However , our enemy Satan the Devil is determined to break our integrity .
Three God - fearing worshippers of Jehovah ​ — Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego — ​ did not comply .
6 : 1 - 27 .
Politely but fearlessly these young Witnesses explained their stand .
Consider also Joseph , whose wife suffered from cancer and suddenly passed away .
Joseph’s family understood and respected his wishes on funeral rites .
However , his wife’s family are not in the truth , and they wanted certain burial customs performed , including rites that are displeasing to God .
The relatives also tried to organize a wake at my home as is the custom , but I told them that if they insisted on having a wake , it would not be at my home .
He heard my prayers and helped us to remain firm despite the pressure . ”
For Joseph and his children , changing their mind with regard to their worship was not an option .
15 : 21 - 28 .
For a time , Paul felt that it was not appropriate to take John Mark along on their missionary trips because he had abandoned Paul and Barnabas during their first missionary trip .
If they were willing to change , could we not take into consideration extenuating circumstances of others and perhaps change our mind ?
And certain brothers seem disinclined to reach out for congregation responsibilities .
Can you personally identify with one of those cases ?
Do you remember what happened to Cain when he became jealous of his brother and grew hot with anger ?
26 : 3 - 5 , 16 - 20 .
He needed to change his attitude and repent .
At Jeremiah 31 : 15 , we read : “ This is what Jehovah says : ‘ A voice is heard in Ramah , lamentation and bitter weeping : Rachel is weeping over her sons . She has refused to be comforted over her sons , because they are no more . ’ ”
Rachel’s first son was Joseph .
In a sense , then , Rachel could be spoken of as a symbol of all the mothers of Israel , of the northern kingdom and the southern one .
Perhaps some were slaughtered there in the territory of Benjamin where Rachel was buried .
Imagine the cries of grief from the mothers bereft of their sons !
Of course , those who died and went to “ the land of the enemy ” death may return from the grip of that enemy when the dead are resurrected . ​ — Jer .
What does God want for his worshippers , young and old alike ?
In many countries , a large number of those getting baptized are young people .
How encouraging it is to see so many youths joining the ranks of those who have decided to serve Jehovah !
A certain happiness comes from enjoying pleasant times with those of our own age .
However , whether we are young or old and regardless of our background , God wants us to be united in worshipping him .
( b ) What attitude harmonizes with Ephesians 4 : 25 ?
What a contrast there is between young servants of Jehovah and youths of this world !
Some researchers call them “ Generation Me . ”
Such an attitude harmonizes with Paul’s statement that “ we are members belonging to one another . ”
God’s angels urged Lot to leave and to find safety in the mountainous region , saying : “ Escape for your life ! ”
Would it not have been senseless to do so and miss out on Jehovah’s protection ? ​ — 1 Cor .
And they did not do so independently , each as he saw fit or felt inclined .
For instance , after many Jews and proselytes became Christians , they devoted themselves “ to the teaching of the apostles , to associating together , to the taking of meals , and to prayers . ”
When will unity be particularly important ?
The prophet Joel describes it as “ a day of darkness and gloom . ”
Recall Jesus ’ words : “ Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin . ” ​ — Matt .
What comparison found at Psalm 122 : 3 , 4 could be applied to God’s people today ?
Those dwellings were built so close together that the psalmist described Jerusalem as “ a city that is joined together as one . ”
What will help us to survive the coming attack on God’s people ?
Rather , we will want to stick close to our brothers .
Jehovah and his Son will bring those who call on Jehovah’s name safely through that calamitous time .
Nevertheless , is it reasonable to think that those who have not maintained unity as part of God’s flock ​ — those who have strayed off on their own — ​ will be saved ? ​ — Mic .
14 , 15 . ( a ) With what objective in mind is Jehovah training young and old today ?
( Read Ephesians 1 : 9 , 10 . )
Does that help you as a young person to see the need to work unitedly with Jehovah’s organization ?
4 : 32 .
Instead , Joseph and Mary found him engaged in a spiritual discussion with teachers at the temple . ​ — Luke 2 : 45 - 47 .
All of us can pray in behalf of our brothers ( See paragraph 18 )
Jehovah’s people already live in accord with the principle found at Romans 12 : 5 : “ We are members belonging to one another . ”
In December 2011 , a tropical storm caused severe flooding on the Philippine island of Mindanao .
In addition , we received coats , shoes , bags , and pajamas . ”
Brothers even came all the way from the United States to help .
Young and old who now learn to strive for unity are actually preparing to survive the end of this wicked , disunited world .
Our next article will consider that subject .
How do you feel about what you have received ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) Christian youths should be careful to avoid what ?
The Bible record tells us that unlike their father , they “ perverted justice . ” ​ — Read 1 Samuel 8 : 1 - 5 .
When the book of God’s Law was found and read to Josiah , he made an earnest effort to apply Jehovah’s instructions .
Josiah’s other successors ​ — his son Zedekiah and his grandson Jehoiachin — ​ were no better ; neither chose to follow Josiah’s upright ways . ​ — 2 Ki .
Though Solomon came from an outstanding spiritual background and started out well , he later lost appreciation for the right way .
Consequently , Solomon lost Jehovah’s favor .
They must have cooperated with their father .
Hananiah , Mishael , Azariah , and Daniel were taken to Babylon in 617 B.C.E .
They were good - looking , intelligent young men who could easily have just blended into the Babylonian way of life .
He received much from his Father , and he truly valued it .
He helped his listeners to see the need for being “ no part of the world , ” which in general does not value spiritual things . ​ — John 15 : 19 .
This certainly has done much to make you “ wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus ” and to help you to be “ completely equipped ” for God’s service .
Some have even been tempted to see what life in the world is like .
But would you run in front of a moving car just to find out how painful ​ — and possibly fatal — ​ that could be ?
Of course not !
He got baptized at age 12 .
Gener began to live a double life .
He says about his coming back to the congregation : “ There are many challenges that still confront me , but the blessings from Jehovah far outnumber them . ”
Of course , there are other young ones associated with the congregation who were not raised by Christian parents .
There are billions of people on the earth .
Should that not give all of us , no matter how we learned the truth , cause for rejoicing ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 12 . )
Who am I to be known by Jehovah , the Owner of the universe ? ”
A Christian sister from the same area said : “ Students feel very proud just to be recognized by their teacher .
What is a wise choice for Christian youths today ?
He likely had to deny himself many things that would consume his time and attention , limiting how much he could train .
Most of all , it’s as if you can see Jehovah God being proud of you and smiling at you !
3 : 18 .
Granted , God does not give us things automatically .
( Read 1 John 5 : 3 , 4 . )
We have accurate knowledge of his Word and a clear understanding of the truth about him and his purposes .
Well , see if you can answer the following questions :
Whether to cremate or not is a personal decision .
What challenges might one face when moving to a foreign land to serve where the need is greater ?
For one thing , Jacob showed Joseph special favor , giving him a special robe .
Each tract prompts us to read a Bible text and present the householder with a question .
What covenant in the Bible allows others to rule with Christ ?
After the last Passover meal with the apostles , Jesus made a covenant with his faithful disciples that can be referred to as the Kingdom covenant .
Timgad was a large Roman city in North Africa ( modern - day Algeria ) . Showing what some there believed , an excavated inscription reads : “ Hunting , Bathing , Playing , Laughing ​ — That’s Living ! ”

Does the Bible Comment on Same - Sex Marriages ?
Government corruption has been defined as the abuse of public power for private gain .
Of course , corruption involves more than just accepting bribes .
Corrupt public officials sometimes appropriate goods , take advantage of services to which they are not entitled , or even steal funds outright .
While corruption can exist in any human organization , it seems that corruption in government is the worst .
EUROPE : “ The extent of the problem [ corruption in Europe ] is breathtaking , ” according to European Commission Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström .
COVER SUBJECT | A GOVERNMENT FREE OF CORRUPTION
Among the blessings that the Kingdom will bring to mankind is the elimination of government corruption .
A vicious circle may result ​ — the government raises taxes to make up for such losses , and this in turn fosters more corruption .
THE PROBLEM : The effort to eliminate corruption “ must start at the top , ” observes Susan Rose - Ackerman , quoted in the preceding article .
Its stability helps to ensure that the actions it takes are always in the best long - term interests of its people .
To eliminate corruption , then , people must be taught how to overcome entrenched motives such as greed and selfishness .
While this is a noble goal , God’s Kingdom does more than just promote these qualities ​ — it requires them of its subjects .
The Bible says that “ greedy people ” and “ liars ” will not qualify to inherit the Kingdom . ​ — 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 ; Revelation 21 : 8 .
People can learn to adhere to these high moral standards , as the early Christians proved .
Once Simon saw the danger of his wrong desire , he asked the apostles to pray in his behalf so that he could overcome it . ​ — Acts 8 : 18 - 24 .
Regardless of your nationality , you have the opportunity to become a subject of God’s Kingdom .
YEAR BORN : 1987
I was born in Baku , Azerbaijan , as the second of two children .
My father was Muslim , and my mother was Jewish .
About that time , Father sent my sister and me to a Jewish school . Among other subjects , we were taught Torah traditions and the Hebrew language .
Thus , in the morning , I prayed namaz at home , and later in the day , I joined Jewish prayers in school .
Why did God create him ? ”
My faith in God was shattered in 2002 .
I was sure he would grant my entreaties .
From the Scriptures the Witnesses showed us convincing proof that idol worship is forbidden for true Christians and that prayers should be directed exclusively to God .
Again , they answered with the Bible and explained that Jesus is neither God nor equal to Him .
They immediately started a Bible study with me .
I came to understand that although God permits injustice , he detests it and will soon remove it forever .
How can a man fulfill his role as a husband in a loving way ?
Just as many institutions appoint a head to oversee their affairs , God has appointed the husband to be head of his wife .
As husbands , how should you exercise your God - given authority ?
He often alleviated their physical suffering and provided refreshing spiritual help .
In contrast , a man named Kweku , who has a good marriage , says : “ I often ask my wife how I can share the load .
She was right .
Though some observers likely concluded that this woman acted presumptuously , Jesus perceived that she was desperate .
He thus showed what kind of man he was ​ — a man of empathy . ​ — Mark 5 : 25 - 34 .
When your wife does not feel well , show her extra consideration and be patient .
It is true that Jesus sometimes wanted to be alone with his thoughts and to pray .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example can help a man become a better husband and father
Communicate ​ — from your mind and heart — ​ with your wife .
On the other hand , note how Ana feels when her husband opens up to her .
According to the Mosaic Law , this woman’s condition made her religiously impure , and thus anyone she touched would have been reckoned unclean . ​ — Leviticus 15 : 19 , 25 .
Some scholars say that the term was also used in a broader sense to refer to an official assigned to duties in the court of the king .
And the Ethiopian is described as a royal treasurer who “ had gone to Jerusalem to worship . ” ​ — Acts 8 : 27 .
When describing a future time of judgment , Jesus said : “ When the Son of man comes in his glory , . . . he will separate people one from another , just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats . ”
Normally , sheep and goats were herded and allowed to graze together during the day .
At night they would be gathered into enclosures that protected them from wild animals , thieves , and the cold .

Let Jehovah Fortify and Safeguard Your Marriage
Is Unfailing Love Possible ?
Our yeartext for 2015 will remind us of this throughout the coming year .

Our yeartext for 2015 : “ Give thanks to Jehovah , for he is good . ” ​ — Psalm 106 : 1
Like the ancient Israelites , we could become ungrateful and lose appreciation for our precious relationship with Jehovah and for the blessings that we have received from him . ​ — Ps .
When the psalmist did so , he was awed by the many wonderful things that Jehovah had done . ​ — Read Psalm 40 : 5 ; 107 : 43 .
Evidently , he meditated on his blessings , for he frequently expressed heartfelt thanks .
And when Paul faced trialsome situations , he was quick to thank Jehovah for the timely support that he received from his spiritual brothers .
For what are you particularly grateful to Jehovah ?
How can we imitate Paul’s fine example in cultivating and expressing gratitude ?
Or the forgiveness that you receive because of your faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice ?
Of course , your beloved marriage mate or your precious children would not escape your mention .
When we have our blessings firmly fixed in mind and heart , we are ready to pray to Jehovah and offer thanksgiving .
Many view prayer as merely a way to ask God for things .
Consider : Our original parents , Adam and Eve , were placed in a paradise garden .
They greedily desired more . As a result , they lost everything .
Surrounded by an unthankful world , we too could begin to lose sight of all that Jehovah has done for us .
We could begin to take our friendship with him for granted .
When confronted with grievous trials , why should we reflect on our blessings ?
We may feel overwhelmed if we are suddenly confronted with life - altering circumstances , such as the unfaithfulness of a marriage mate , a life - threatening illness , the death of a loved one , or the devastating effects of a natural disaster .
Irina * , a regular pioneer in North America , was married to an elder who proved unfaithful and abandoned her and their children .
How has Kyung - sook benefited from these nightly prayers ?
How did Jason find comfort after the loss of his wife ?
Jason , who serves at a branch office in Africa , has been in full - time service for more than 30 years .
I still feel the pain of the loss , but thanking Jehovah for having had a good marriage and for the privilege of serving him with someone who deeply loved him has improved my outlook . ”
She said : “ I lost my home , and I lost most of my family . ”
“ I saw all that the brothers and sisters did to bring relief and encouragement to those who needed help .
I knew that brothers all around the world were praying for me . ”
We look forward to receiving countless spiritual blessings from Jehovah during 2015 .
Therefore , may we be determined to maintain a spirit like that of the prophet Habakkuk , who said : “ Although the fig tree may not blossom , and there may be no fruit on the vines ; although the olive crop may fail , and the fields may produce no food ; although the flock may disappear from the pen , and there may be no cattle in the stalls ; yet , as for me , I will exult in Jehovah ; I will be joyful in the God of my salvation . ”
How can husbands and wives apply the Golden Rule ?
“ IF YOU put forth sincere effort and show that you want your marriage to succeed , you can enjoy Jehovah’s blessing , ” says a husband who has been happily married for 38 years .
Yes , husbands and wives have the potential for enjoying happy times as well as for supporting each other through difficult times . ​ — Prov .
At times , this stress caused us to clash . ”
Let us discuss five of the spiritual building blocks for a strong and lasting marriage .
The cornerstone of a secure marriage is loyalty and submission to the One who instituted marriage .
Husbands and wives can include Jehovah in their marriage by following his loving guidance .
Daily prayer together is also invaluable in building a marriage that can withstand the onslaughts of Satan’s world .
“ Whenever our joy has been clouded by personal difficulties or misunderstandings , ” says Gerhard in Germany , “ the counsel from God’s Word has helped us to develop patience and practice forgiveness .
How a husband exercises his headship can do much to build a strong and happy marriage .
11 : 28 - 30 .
In public and in private , husbands show by their respectful words and compassionate actions that their wives are precious to them .
One important way that a submissive wife shows respect for Jehovah’s authority is by being cooperative and supportive within the family circle .
Realistically , not all of a husband’s decisions will be to his wife’s liking .
She provides valuable input concerning family decisions by respectfully expressing her thoughts and feelings yet remaining submissive .
One of the crucial building blocks of an enduring marriage is forgiveness .
7 : 18 , 19 .
True love “ does not keep account of wrongs . ”
Experience the peace of mind , unity , and divine blessings that come to those who have a forgiving disposition . ​ — Rom .
14 : 19 .
What is the Golden Rule , and how is it of practical value in a marriage ?
In fact , Jesus recommended a more positive way of handling difficult situations .
“ True , there are times when we’re upset , but we have worked hard to treat each other the way we would like to be treated ​ — with respect and dignity . ”
A man who verbally or physically abuses his wife is anything but manly , and he will lose his relationship with Jehovah .
The psalmist David , who himself was a strong and courageous man , said : “ Be agitated , but do not sin . Have your say in your heart , upon your bed , and keep silent . ” ​ — Ps .
Read 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 - 7 .
Love is the most important quality in a marriage .
True , it takes loving devotion , loyal commitment , and earnest effort to make a marriage succeed .
What kind of communication strengthens a marriage ?
That disastrous example was recorded “ for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have come . ”
Why do married couples need Jehovah’s direction and protection ?
( See opening image . )
Because of today’s scourge of immorality , husbands and wives need Jehovah’s direction and protection so that their efforts to safeguard their marriage will not be in vain .
( Read Psalm 127 : 1 . )
What has led some Christians into wrongdoing ?
The disastrous path of immorality often starts with the eyes .
Jesus explained : “ Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart . ”
Jesus said : “ Out of the heart come wicked reasonings , murders , adulteries , sexual immorality . ” ​ — Matt .
( b ) How can a moral collapse be avoided ?
How tragic !
Friendship with Jehovah is a vital source of moral protection .
What helped Joseph to keep his spiritual defenses intact under such tempting circumstances ?
It was his firm resolve not to damage his relationship with God that safeguarded his chastity and integrity .
As a result of his resolute stand , he lost his job and was unjustly imprisoned , but Jehovah blessed him .
Whether at work or in a private setting , Christians need to avoid putting themselves in tempting situations with someone other than their marriage mate .
( Read Colossians 3 : 5 , 6 . )
How can the new personality strengthen a marriage ?
His wife , Sonja , agrees , and she adds : “ Kindness is certainly a vital quality .
4 : 32 .
“ Under such circumstances , ” says a wife in Germany , “ silence can hurt your partner . ”
Therefore , even in difficult situations , endeavor to make what you say gracious , both in your tone of voice and in your choice of words .
A husband and a wife can reinforce their marriage with good communication by saying “ only what is good for building up as the need may be , to impart what is beneficial ” to their spouse . ​ — Eph .
Why is it important for marriage mates to be sensitive to each other’s emotional and sexual needs ?
The couple immediately submitted their applications .
More than a year went by , but Cesar and Rocio had not been invited to Bethel .
Has Jehovah blessed such a self - sacrificing spirit ?
Indeed , he has !
Kenneth , a retired builder , and Maureen , who are in their mid - 50 ’ s , moved from California to serve on the Warwick project .
They had a successful precision machining company that employed 17 people .
“ Without a doubt , the single greatest challenge for us has been leaving our comfort zone , ” says William .
However , after much prayer , the couple decided to go ahead with their move ​ — a step they do not regret .
“ One of our priorities was that of finding a congregation with young ones who were doing well spiritually , ” says Ricky .
“ We wanted Jacob to have plenty of good association . ”
“ He told me , ‘ Don’t worry , Dad .
With what effect ?
The construction projects at Wallkill and Warwick will eventually be completed , so those who have been invited to assist realize that their Bethel service is temporary .
Although we don’t know how , when , or where , we are confident that he will continue to care for us . ” ​ — Ps .
Dale , a civil engineer , and Cathy , from Alabama , highly recommend this type of service .
And what is needed for you to make yourself available ?
Gary , from North Carolina , has 30 years ’ experience in construction management .
For King David , his “ heart’s desire ” was to build a house for Jehovah’s name .
Moreover , there is a great need for those who qualify to take up foreign assignments .
Make it a matter of prayer .
When it proves to be unswerving and enduring , the love between a man and a woman can truly be beautiful .
It also vividly portrays what that love is like and how it is displayed .
When God presented the first woman , Eve , to the first man , Adam , the words that came out of Adam’s mouth were nothing short of poetic .
The love between the opposite sexes has other characteristics besides its potential for being constant and enduring .
The girl is brought into Solomon’s camp because her beauty attracted Solomon , who was camping near the vineyards she was guarding .
The shepherd finds his way into the camp , and beautiful expressions of endearment are exchanged . ​ — Song of Sol .
Even though the expressions reflect the Oriental setting of some 3,000 years ago and may appear strange to today’s readers , they are full of meaning , and the feelings they convey are not foreign to us .
Consider what the shepherd says about the young woman’s speech .
Is it love governed by Bible principles ?
Love is best sensed when it is expressed .
For her , they proved to be “ better than wine ” that makes the heart rejoice , and his name was as soothing as “ fragrant oil poured out ” on the head .
The Song of Solomon also provides lessons for unmarried Christians , especially for those looking for a mate .
Why did the Shulammite girl love the shepherd ?
But he was more than just strong and handsome .
“ Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest ” was her “ dear one among the sons . ”
Though she was beautiful enough to attract the attention of a king who at the time had “ 60 queens and 80 concubines and young women without number , ” she viewed herself as “ but a saffron of the coastal plain ” ​ — a common flower .
Christians refrain from developing a romantic interest in unbelievers ( See paragraph 14 )
Did they not trust her ?
Actually , they were taking precautions so that their sister would not come into a tempting situation .
Whether you are seeking a marriage mate or have already entered wedlock , may you experience true love ​ — “ the flame of Jah . ” ​ — Song of Sol .
Why should we observe the Lord’s Evening Meal ?
NIGHT has fallen , but a full moon bathes Jerusalem in soft light . It is the evening of Nisan 14 , 33 C.E .
Jesus says a blessing and passes unleavened bread to the apostles , saying : “ Take , eat . ”
He takes a cup of wine , again offers thanks , and says : “ Drink out of it , all of you . ”
What is the meaning of the bread and the wine ?
And how do Christians respond to what the Scriptures say about their hope ?
15 : 21 , 22 .
11 : 23 - 25 .
How should we view the Memorial bread and wine ?
When instituting the Memorial , Jesus did not miraculously change the bread and the wine into his literal flesh and blood .
On that highly important occasion in 33 C.E . , Jesus used unleavened bread left over from the Passover meal .
So bread of that kind is used at the Memorial .
At Golgotha , a place outside Jerusalem , his blood was poured out “ for forgiveness of sins . ”
“ It becomes more special each year .
How might preparation for the Memorial affect our ministry ?
If such an anointed one has produced “ fruits that befit repentance , ” then he is not showing contempt for Jesus ’ sacrifice by partaking of the Memorial emblems . ​ — Luke 3 : 8 .
As we personally prepare for the Memorial , we would find it beneficial to give prayerful thought to our God - given hope .
Therefore , how can one determine whether to partake of the emblems or not ?
What bearing does the new covenant have on the partaking of the Memorial emblems ?
God has made the new covenant with the spiritual Israelites .
8 : 6 ; 9 : 15 .
Individuals entitled to partake of the Memorial emblems know that they have been taken into the Kingdom covenant .
Those who became Jesus ’ anointed followers and loyally stuck with Jesus , sharing in his sufferings , were to share his heavenly rule .
Only those who have the witness of the spirit that they are God’s children should partake of the Memorial emblems .
( Read Romans 8 : 15 - 17 . )
By all means , be present at the Lord’s Evening Meal .
See Appendix B12 in the New World Translation .
So I don’t think we have much to talk about .
Brian : I appreciate your telling me that .
And your name ?
I know it’s a good book , but I never really thought of the Bible as a historical book .
Brian : That’s OK .
Eric : How is that an example of accurate history ?
Eric : Interesting .
He is mentioned here at Luke chapter 3 , verse 1 ​ — among many other government officials of the time .
Here’s why : Our basic human needs have not changed from the beginning of time .
Brian : The Bible can help us in all those areas .
It is what we might call an old but modern book .
Brian : Let me put it another way : The Bible contains fundamental principles that are as relevant today as they were when they were written centuries ago .
Brian : Exactly .
But that’s easier said than done .
* With any relationship , there needs to be balance and compromise . My wife and I have found that the Bible can help us find that balance .
I can spare a couple of minutes .
Here is the home page .
Is there one that interests you ?
It says : “ If communication is the lifeblood of a marriage , then love and respect are the heart and lungs of the relationship . ”
Hmm , I like the way they explain that . Brian : Thank you for reading .
There’s a Bible verse cited here .
Ephesians 5 : 33 .
Brian : Well , isn’t it true that the man wants to feel he is respected by his wife and that in turn , the wife wants to be assured that her husband really loves her ?
Brian : If the husband often looks for ways to show his love for his wife , wouldn’t it be easier for the wife to manifest respect for him ?
And to repeat the illustration we read earlier , the “ heart and lungs ” of the marriage will remain healthy . Eric : I must admit , there is more to the Bible than I thought .
Imagine how a world government could benefit mankind .
Today many people suffer because they are so poor , while others are very rich .
Some governments are cruel .
Soon , Jesus will rid the earth of bad people and will establish peace and security worldwide . ​ — Read Micah 4 : 3 , 4 .

If the matter cannot be resolved reasonably and some are still suffering severely , the congregation may be in a position to record the meetings for these ones or to arrange for a telephone hookup to their home , as has been done for others who are confined to their homes .
In recent years , Our Kingdom Ministry has encouraged brothers and sisters to show special consideration in this matter while attending regional conventions .
However , it was never intended that this direction become a general rule for congregation meetings , and it should not be interpreted as such .
While we live in this system of things , all of us suffer the consequences of inherited imperfection .
This stone slab was inscribed with Pilate’s name in Latin
The inscription ( shown here ) is fragmentary but is thought originally to have read : “ To the honorable gods ( this ) Tiberieum Pontius Pilate , Prefect of Judaea , had dedicated . ”
The building referred to was likely a temple honoring the Roman Emperor Tiberius .
Further consideration of the matter suggests that a modification to this direction is appropriate .

How can you imitate Jesus in showing humility ?
Why will imitating Jesus draw us closer to Jehovah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) Why did Jehovah provide us with a written portrait of his Son , and what does Jehovah expect us to do ?
Showing humility calls for strength and courage .
God’s Son has a long record of humility , showing it both as a powerful spirit creature in heaven and as a perfect man on earth .
Consider a few examples .
The Bible writer Jude recorded an example from Jesus ’ prehuman existence .
The issue involved “ Moses ’ body . ”
What a humble attitude !
Instead , he directed all glory to his Father .
Rather , he dignified them , praising them for the good he saw in them and expressing his confidence in them .
He outstandingly showed humility by his obedience .
Consider W .
( Read Isaiah 40 : 12 - 15 . )
A humble attitude indeed !
Regarding the Scriptural call for compassion , one Bible reference work says : “ That call is more than an appeal for us to feel with and for the needy .
A tender person is moved to make a difference in the lives of others .
What shows that Jesus felt tender compassion for others , and what did his tenderness move him to do ?
When he saw his friend Mary and those with her weeping over the death of her brother , Lazarus , Jesus openly “ gave way to tears . ”
Then , likely stirred by heartfelt pity ​ — just as when he raised a widow’s son — ​ he resurrected Lazarus .
15 : 32 - 38 ; 20 : 29 - 34 ; Mark 1 : 40 - 42 .
( See opening image . )
He assured his followers that God had tender concern for each of His worshippers , including the “ little ones ” ​ — those who may seem unimportant from the standpoint of the world . ​ — Matt .
How can we cultivate tender feelings for others ?
Our tender feelings .
How can you cultivate tender feelings for others ?
Listen carefully when someone shares his feelings and concerns .
Tenderness moves us to want to make a difference in the lives of others , especially those who may be like a bruised reed or a smoldering wick .
Is there an elderly Christian who needs transportation to get to the meetings , to go out in the ministry , or to go to the doctor ?
Above all , we can show tender concern for others by having a full share in the ministry .
What can we say to encourage such ones ?
We can reassure them that Jehovah deeply cares for his servants who are “ brokenhearted ” or “ crushed in spirit . ”
( b ) What will we discuss in the next article ?
Remember , it is your responsibility to nourish , encourage , and refresh his sheep .
Hence , an elder who is tenderly compassionate does not try to control the sheep , making rules or using guilt to pressure them to do more when their circumstances do not permit them to .
Let us examine some suggestions .
Very likely , good results will be obtained if the trainee observes and imitates the methods used in the ministry by the one who is helping him .
The new publisher will undoubtedly appreciate having someone with him who can listen and help out if the need arises .
As they worked together , they could stimulate and motivate each other .
What privileges or experiences has he had ?
Whatever the response from the field turns out to be , working with someone in the ministry provides a fine opportunity to “ keep . . . building one another up . ” ​ — 1 Thess .
5 : 11 .
Considering the points listed in the box can motivate you to keep on preaching zealously .
Then meditate on the reasons and the scriptures that support them .

And how has it been received ?
Japanese characters can be set vertically or horizontally , and quite a few printed items ​ — including our recent publications — ​ have been set horizontally .
Many Japanese readers consider this to be an easy - to - read style .
Additionally , the page headings were moved into the text as subheadings so that the readers can easily see the main points .
Why would this single Bible book especially meet the needs of the Japanese field ?
To most Japanese , the word “ Bible ” calls to mind Jesus Christ .

Matthew is being featured in public witnessing .
One hour later , the woman e - mailed the sister , saying that she had read part of the Bible book and wanted to know more .
Led by Charles Taze Russell , they studied the subject of Christ’s ransom and soon realized its central place in Jehovah’s purpose .
They appreciatively felt moved to commemorate Jesus ’ death each year in remembrance of him . ​ — 1 Cor .
Brother Russell went on to publish Zion’s Watch Tower , which championed the doctrine of the ransom as a foremost expression of God’s love .
Each year , more and more came to Pittsburgh for the Memorial .
“ Come , ” urged the Watch Tower , “ with your own heart overflowing with love for the Master and for his brethren and for his truth . ”
As the ranks of the Bible Students grew , so did the number and size of Memorial gatherings worldwide .
However , wine was provided for those who felt that “ fermented wine was meant to be used . ”
In some congregations , however , a mournful atmosphere prevailed , and when the program concluded , all left barely saying a word .
The 1934 book Jehovah , though , said that the Memorial should be held , not “ in sorrow ” over Jesus ’ painful death , but “ in joy ” over his rulership as King since 1914 .
Now this vast throng was identified as faithful worshippers who hope to live on a paradise earth .
During this “ very precious season , ” special preaching campaigns provided a fine way for all to show appreciation for the ransom .
A 1932 Bulletin urged Christians not to be “ Memorial saints , ” ones who were partakers but not “ actual workers , ” preaching the message of truth .
Regarding the anointed , the Informant commented : “ Their joy can be complete only by sharing in the Kingdom witness . ”
To all of Jehovah’s people , the Memorial is the most sacred night of the year .
In 1930 , Pearl English and her sister , Ora , walked some 50 miles ( 80 km ) to attend the Memorial .
The Bulletin was later called Informant , now Our Kingdom Ministry .
( b ) What can help us to stay on course on our journey to salvation ?
WHEN we become disciples of Christ , we embark on a journey .
Along the way , however , we must be careful not to get distracted or lost .
Our Exemplar , Jesus , led the way .
By studying that record , we learn what Jesus is like .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 8 , 9 . )
If we carefully follow his steps , we will reach “ the goal ” of our faith ​ — salvation .
Self - sacrificing love impels us to show courage even at great personal risk .
( See opening image . )
Note what happened when young Jesus was “ in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers . ”
Yet , at the Passover meal , Jesus told Judas : “ What you are doing , do it more quickly . ”
Although his own life was in danger , he spoke up to protect his disciples .

About to take his last agonizing breath , he called out in triumph : “ It has been accomplished ! ” ​ — John 19 : 28 - 30 .
( Read Psalm 86 : 12 . )
You may face pressure to accept evolution as a fact .
As true Christians , we need to keep “ speaking with boldness by the authority of Jehovah . ”
Imbued with courage , we will not be silenced .
And we will persevere in preaching the good news despite apathy , ridicule , or opposition . ​ — 1 Thess .
Trusting in God gives us the faith and courage to face adversities .
We refuse any treatment that conflicts with Bible principles .
34 : 18 .
He is “ slow to anger . ”
It is especially helpful to consider the example of Jesus , the most discerning man who ever lived .
After his resurrection , when speaking to two disciples on their way to Emmaus , he “ interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures . ”
Discernment helped Jesus to control his spirit , making him “ slow to anger . ”
He was “ mild - tempered . ”
He was always patient with his disciples despite their failings .
( Read . )
He promised his followers that he would remain involved in this work “ until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ​ — Matt .
When we talk to others about God’s Kingdom , we season our words “ with salt . ”
We try to discern the needs and interests of householders and then choose our words accordingly .
In our spirit and attitude .
Discernment also helps us to be reasonable .
1 - 3 .
Jesus ’ disciples faced what obstacles to preaching the good news in “ all the nations ” ?
JESUS CHRIST gave his followers no small commission .
He commanded them : “ Go . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations . ”
The disciples loved both Jesus and the good news .
Yet , they might well have wondered just how they could possibly carry out their commission .
Moreover , Jesus had warned his disciples that they would be hated and persecuted and that some of them would be killed .
Such challenges must have seemed daunting !
How successful were the first - century disciples in their preaching activity ?
By the second century Christians . . . began to argue that it was a divine providence which had prepared the world for the advent of Christianity . ”
But this much is certain : Jehovah wanted the good news to be preached , and Satan did not .
Christians made good use of the Roman system of roads .
Roman engineers constructed over 50,000 miles ( 80,000 km ) of roads that linked nearly every province .
There were difficulties , but the apostle Paul and others could journey throughout the realm without passports and visas .
There were no immigration and customs checks .
Travel by sea was similarly safe because Rome’s navies kept sea lanes free of piracy .
Using a codex made it much easier to find a scripture ( See paragraph 12 )
( b ) When did the codex become widely used by Christians ?
The Gospel of Matthew alone would fill an entire scroll .
But then came the codex ​ — the earliest form of a book .
It was a collection of pages bound together .
A reader could open a codex and easily locate a passage of Scripture .
13 , 14 . ( a ) How did Paul make use of his Roman citizenship ?
It was not .
When Paul pointed out that he was a Roman citizen by birth , “ the men who were about to interrogate him under torture backed away from him ; and the military commander became afraid when he realized that [ Paul ] was a Roman and that he had bound him in chains . ” ​ — Acts 22 : 25 - 29 .
Thus , Roman law made possible “ the defending and legally establishing of the good news . ” ​ — Phil .
How widespread were first - century Jewish communities ?
Centuries earlier the Assyrians and later the Babylonians had exiled the Jews from their homeland .
It has been estimated that of the 60,000,000 people in the Roman Empire , about 1 in 14 was Jewish .
( b ) What practices of the Jews did the disciples adopt ?
They regularly met together in synagogues or at open - air meeting places . They sang songs , prayed , and discussed the Scriptures .
What obstacles to the preaching work have Christians in modern times faced ?
THE Bible Students * of the late 19th and early 20th centuries faced many obstacles .
And their preaching work would take place during “ the last days , ” an era characterized by “ critical times hard to deal with . ” ​ — 2 Tim .
He has taught us for our own good , has blessed us with peace , and has helped us to impart his teaching to others .
This does not mean that Jehovah exercises his foresight so that he knows and then influences every development on earth in order to advance the Kingdom - preaching work .
Since 1950 , they have published the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , in whole or in part , in over 120 languages .
In the 20th century , for example , millions of people died as a result of warfare , especially during the two world wars .
In 1944 , there were fewer than 110,000 Kingdom publishers worldwide .
Are we not thankful when we can preach the good news under peaceful conditions ?
What developments have there been in the field of transportation , and how have they helped us in our work ?
Airplanes allow circuit overseers , Branch Committee members , missionaries , and others to travel swiftly to conventions or to care for theocratic assignments .
Advancements in transportation thus help to promote unity among Jehovah’s people . ​ — Ps .
Many would say that English is such a language .
How have present - day Christians benefited from laws and legal decisions ?
24 : 9 .
During the past two centuries , however , noteworthy changes have taken place in the printing industry .
Paper production and bookbinding have become less expensive .
What has all of this meant for our work ?
Consider some inventions of the past 200 years that God’s people have used in preaching the good news .

Sadly , though , the cold reality is this : We are mortal .
The Bible tells us that God has put in our hearts a longing for eternity as well as a desire to comprehend it .
If your answer is no , you are right .
When danger approaches , we dodge , hide , or flee .
Is there any reason to believe that this age - old enemy will be brought to nothing ?
Jehovah God , the Creator , did not make humans to live just a few years and then to die .
Throughout history , men have struggled to solve the problem of death , but with no success . In modern times , the quest continues .
Scientists have developed vaccines and medications that have subdued some diseases .
Yet , death is far from vanquished .
As the Bible says , “ all are returning to the dust . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 20 .
In order to understand how belief in Jesus is linked to salvation from death , we must first learn why we die .
Some believe that the tree symbolized sexual relations , but that could not be .
Jehovah called it “ the tree of the knowledge of good and bad ” because it represented his right to determine what was good or bad for humans .
At death , he became as lifeless as the dust from which he had been formed . ​ — Genesis 2 : 7 ; Ecclesiastes 9 : 5 , 10 .
We are all descendants of Adam .
He wrote : “ I am fleshly , sold under sin .
But , unlike Adam , Jesus “ committed no sin . ”
Three days later , Jehovah brought him back to life as a spirit so that he could in time return to heaven .
Jesus thus bought back what Adam had forfeited .
What Jehovah promises , he is fully able to do .
Not only will you experience his rich blessing now but you will gain the hope of life eternal in the earthly Paradise , where “ death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ”
( 3 ) He appealed his case to Caesar , the emperor in Rome , so that it would be heard directly by him . ​ — Acts 16 : 37 - 39 ; 22 : 25 - 28 ; 25 : 10 - 12 .
The shepherd had to make good any shortfall , or loss .

In giving the sign of his presence , Jesus related two illustrations that we will consider .
One involves slaves who are given talents , and the other speaks of people being separated as sheep are from goats .

LIFE STORY
David : I was born in 1945 in the county of Shropshire , England .
My father had noticed that at a very young age , I wanted to dance whenever I heard music .
One of the choreographers of the Royal Ballet set up an international company in Wuppertal , Germany , and selected us to be the two soloist dancers he took with him .
This kind of competitive life makes one think a lot of oneself , and we became dedicated to our profession .
David and I shared the ambition of getting to the top .
Since I had grown up on a farm , I began longing for a simpler life in the countryside .
Still , she accepted my proposal and joined me in a rural life that she knew little about .
At David’s suggestion , I learned to drive a car , and one day while visiting a nearby town , I saw Gael , whom I had met when she worked in one of the local shops .
I also saw God’s name , Jehovah , in the Bible for the first time . ​ — Ex .
6 : 3 .
Gwen : A big obstacle that I had to overcome was superstition .
By now we had another daughter , and it was thrilling to learn that our family could live forever on a paradise earth .
David : When I understood the amazing fulfillment of Bible prophecies , such as those found in Matthew chapter 24 and in the book of Daniel , I became convinced that this was the truth .
Thus , as time went on , I became less ambitious .
Philippians 2 : 4 convinced me that I should not center my thoughts on myself and my desire to get a bigger farm .
To our great delight , all three of our daughters began pioneering when they finished school .
Then we returned to England to assist with construction at London Bethel .
Because of my farming experience , I was asked to help at the Bethel farm that was operating at the time .
Gwen : Our first dedication ​ — to ballet — ​ was enjoyable but fleeting .

Helping many people to learn precious , lifesaving truths has brought us inestimable happiness .
These “ letters of recommendation ” are better than any worldly fame .
If we had not found the truth , we would now have only memories , old photos , and theater programs from our former career .
15 : 20 ; 2 Sam .
How has our way of explaining Bible accounts gradually changed ?
( See opening image . )
CAN you imagine what it was like to see Jesus Christ become “ overjoyed in the holy spirit ” ?
He was keenly interested in how they would handle their assignment .
Nonetheless , the disciples returned from their mission aglow with excitement .
How did they benefit from being humble ?
By means of holy spirit , Jehovah helped them to grasp vital spiritual truths while the wise and intellectual ones , who scorned them , remained blinded by Satan and by their own pride .
First , there is the simplified edition of The Watchtower .
Many have written touching expressions of heartfelt appreciation .
“ I was a wallflower , ” she said .
In fact , one faithful anointed brother with a record of decades of loyal service commented : “ I just read the book of Job in the new edition , and I feel as if I understand it for the first time ! ”
It was explained that the faithful slave is the Governing Body , while the “ domestics ” are all those who are fed spiritually , whether of the anointed or of the “ other sheep . ”
What are some examples of inspired prophetic pictures in the Bible ?
Can we conclude , though , that every character , event , and object described in the Bible foreshadows someone or something ?
How was the Bible account about Naboth explained in the past ?
Ahab and Jezebel were said to picture Satan and his organization ; Naboth pictured Jesus ; Naboth’s death , then , was prophetic of Jesus ’ execution .
For many years , God’s people found this approach to Bible accounts faith strengthening .
( b ) Our literature focuses more on what today ?
The details of such teachings ​ — who pictures whom and why — ​ can be hard to keep straight , to remember , and to apply .
That righteous man died , not because he was a prophetic type of Jesus or of the anointed , but because he was an integrity keeper .
( See footnote . )
For example , we can rightly say that Naboth’s integrity in the face of persecution and death reminds us of the integrity of Christ and his anointed .
One of his favorite teaching methods involved the use of illustrations .
What will we consider in the following article ?
Granted , God’s Word also contains things that may seem “ hard to understand , ” including some parts of Paul’s writings .
2 : 10 .
In what ways can those of the “ other sheep ” benefit from the parable of the ten virgins ?
We noted in the preceding article that over recent decades , the faithful slave has gradually come to explain the Scriptures with less emphasis on symbolic prophetic pictures and more on practical application .
As we will see , the answer is of vital importance .
What about the virgins ?
Next , consider the time frame .
To what time period did Jesus ’ counsel apply ?
In every instance , Jesus was referring to the time during the great tribulation when he will come to carry out the judging work and then the destruction of this world system of things .
Jesus had just discussed his “ faithful and discreet slave . ”
Jesus warned those men that they must remain faithful .
Let us now go through the parable and see how the anointed have applied its counsel .
Because of two qualities : preparedness and vigilance .
They maintain their integrity , refusing to adopt the spirit of this wicked world and its materialistic , immoral , and selfish attitudes .
( a ) How did Jesus warn about the natural tendency toward drowsiness ?
( b ) How have the anointed responded to the shout : “ Here is the bridegroom ” ?
Jesus knew well that even a willing , eager spirit may be hampered by the weakness of the flesh .
What about faithful anointed ones today ?
* However , the climax of the parable focuses on a more specific period of time .
Recall our clarified understanding that Jesus , the Bridegroom , comes to render judgment near the end of the great tribulation .
Is it not likely , then , that this part of the parable focuses on what happens just prior to that climactic judgment ?
So , then , before the great tribulation starts , all the faithful anointed on earth will have received their final sealing .
From then on , their calling is sure .
It may be only at that point that they realize that they are not ready for the arrival of the Bridegroom .
Remember , though , it was “ in the middle of the night . ”
Would they be able to find sellers of oil at that hour ?
Likewise , during the great tribulation , faithful anointed ones cannot help any who had turned unfaithful .
When Christ comes in his glory near the end of the tribulation , he will gather his faithful anointed ones to heaven .
( a ) Why is there no need to conclude that many of Christ’s anointed followers will prove unfaithful ?
( See opening image . )
Remember , he had just warned his “ faithful and discreet slave ” never to turn into an evil slave .
Similarly , this parable conveys a powerful warning .
Likewise , the warning in Jesus ’ parable is given with loving confidence .
Far from it !
Does that apply only to the anointed ?
Each of us may also keep in mind that the foolish virgins asked the discreet ones to give up some of their oil .
The Watchtower of September 15 , 1950 , defined a “ type ” and an “ antitype ” this way : “ A type is an image or representation of something that will come to pass at some future time .
The type may properly be called a shadow ; the antitype , the reality . ”

For example , Jephthah , Job , and Rebekah were thought to represent the anointed , while Deborah and Rahab were said to foreshadow the great crowd .
The passover lamb sacrificed in ancient Israel was a type . ​ — Num .
9 : 2
Paul identified Christ as “ our Passover lamb . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
5 : 7
Hence , there is no Scriptural basis for finding a hidden meaning in that incident . ​ — Gen .
Even the most simple and commonplace circumstance was thought to conceal within itself the most recondite [ hidden ] truth . . . , even in the number of fish caught by the disciples on the night the risen Saviour appeared to them ​ — how much some have tried to make of that number , 153 ! ”
Since barley was considered to be inferior to wheat , Augustine concluded that the five loaves must represent the five books of Moses ( the inferior “ barley ” representing the supposed inferiority of the “ Old Testament ” ) .
How , then , can we benefit from the events and examples found in the Scriptures ?
At Romans 15 : 4 , we read the apostle Paul’s words : “ All the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction , so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope . ”
However , God’s people in every generation , whether of the anointed or of the “ other sheep , ” whether living in “ the last days ” or not , could benefit ​ — and have benefited — ​ from the lessons taught in “ all the things that were written beforehand . ” ​ — John 10 : 16 ; 2 Tim .
Many of God’s servants , both men and women , both of the anointed and of the great crowd , have undergone experiences such as Job faced and “ have seen the outcome Jehovah gave , that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful . ” ​ — Jas .
Consider : In our congregations today , do we not find older women as loyal as Deborah , fine young elders as wise as Elihu , courageous pioneers as zealous as Jephthah , and faithful men and women as patient as Job ?
Why did Jesus give the illustration of the talents ?
In the illustration involving the faithful slave , Jesus highlights the need for the small group of anointed ones entrusted with feeding his domestics during the last days to be faithful and discreet .
In the parable of the virgins , Jesus stresses that all his anointed followers would need to be prepared and to be vigilant , knowing that Jesus is coming but not knowing the day or the hour .
Jesus directs the final illustration , the parable of the sheep and the goats , to those with an earthly hope .
Our publications have long explained that the man , or the master , in the illustration is Jesus and that he traveled abroad when he ascended to heaven in 33 C.E .
* Before traveling abroad , he distributed the talents among his slaves , expecting them to do business while he was gone .
6 , 7 .
He had in mind the ingathering of many other honesthearted ones who would become his disciples .
Like a good farmer , Jesus would not leave unattended a field that was ripe for harvesting .
When giving his followers the commission to make disciples , Jesus was , in effect , committing to them “ his belongings ” ​ — his talents .
Put simply , the talents refer to the responsibility to preach and make disciples .
* ​ — Acts 6 : 7 ; 12 : 24 ; 19 : 20 .
What role do those with the earthly hope play ?
What leads us to conclude that Jesus will settle accounts during the great tribulation ?
What leads us to this conclusion ?
Those represented by the first two slaves ​ — his hardworking anointed disciples — ​ will already have received their final sealing before the great tribulation breaks out .
25 : 34 .
“ There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth ” would be . ​ — Matt .
No .
Consider the context .
* In this context , it seems reasonable to conclude that in the illustration of the talents , Jesus was not saying that a large number of his anointed brothers during the last days would be wicked and sluggish .
25 : 16 .
Second , Christ expects all of us to be diligent in the preaching work .
In Jesus ’ day , a talent was equivalent to about 6,000 denarii .
See The Watchtower , July 15 , 2013 , pages 9 - 12 .
See paragraph 13 of the article “ Will You ‘ Keep on the Watch ’ ? ”
in this issue .
In both illustrations , the master ( 1 ) pictures Jesus , and the slaves ( 2 ) picture his anointed disciples .
Those who die faithful before the great tribulation begins will have received their final sealing by the time of their death .
However , Jesus ’ illustration of the talents focuses on the final accounting for the anointed who are alive on earth at the time of the great tribulation .
How has Jehovah clarified our understanding of the illustration of the sheep and the goats ?
Who receive the commission to preach ?
He describes a time when “ the Son of man ” will judge “ all the nations . ”
In it , Jesus focuses on two groups , one classed as sheep and the other as goats .
Why can we say that the illustration emphasizes the importance of the preaching work ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) What key elements must we know to understand the illustration of the sheep and the goats ?
In 1881 , Zion’s Watch Tower identified “ the Son of man , ” also called “ the King , ” as Jesus .
In the 1920 ’ s , how was our understanding refined ?
What of the timing of the separating of the sheep from the goats ?
Therefore , the separating of the sheep from the goats would have to take place before the Millennial Rule begins .
As a result of that adjusted understanding , Jehovah’s people felt that individuals were being judged as sheep or goats throughout the conclusion of the system of things , depending on how they responded to the Kingdom message .
* The conclusion ? The lead article stated : “ The rendering of judgment on the sheep and the goats is future . ”
Then , with the entire wicked system at its end , Jesus will hold court and render and execute judgment . ”
What about the timing of the judgment ?
With the end of this system so close at hand , how grateful we are that Jehovah has progressively shed light on this illustration and on the related illustrations recorded in Matthew chapters 24 and 25 !
Why are the sheep described as “ righteous ” ?
Likewise , he is not saying that each individual judged to be a sheep must literally feed , clothe , nurse , or visit one of his brothers in prison .
How can the sheep show kindness to Christ’s brothers ?
He is discussing the sign of his presence and the conclusion of the system of things .
However , the small number of anointed ones left on earth during Jesus ’ presence face an enormous challenge ​ — that of preaching to “ all the nations ” before the end comes .
After he was resurrected , Jesus told his followers to make disciples , teaching them to observe “ all the things ” he had commanded .

All those bound by “ the law of the Christ ” must preach .
Jehovah does not have double standards .
Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law .
But all of us , whether anointed or not , are subject to “ the law of the Christ . ”
13 : 17 .
Soon the angels will unleash the destructive winds of the great tribulation .
This will occur after all the remaining ones of Christ’s brothers left on earth have received their final sealing .
Therefore , now is the time for those who hope to be judged as sheep to support Christ’s brothers loyally .
and “ What Future for the Sheep and the Goats ? ”
In many countries , that is indeed the case .
Although Solomon “ was loved by his God , . . . the foreign wives caused even him to sin . ”
You surely want to avoid becoming “ unevenly yoked ” with someone who could take you away from God .
Many Christians today have obeyed God’s time - proven protective directive and have come to realize that they have taken the wise course .
Another example is that of Ndenguè in Cameroon .
She was 19 years old when she got married .
Her fiancé promised her that she would be free to practice her religion .
In addition to resisting the pressure , she saw some of her friends and acquaintances find mates within the congregation .
She says : “ I kept telling myself that since Jehovah is a ‘ happy God , ’ our happiness does not depend on whether we are married or not .
Why ?
He explains : “ I feel blessed because we go out in the ministry together , study together , and worship together .
One thing is to think about why you are not married .
Yet , if you really need a marriage mate , God knows the best way to satisfy your legitimate desires . ​ — Ps .

COVER SUBJECT | WOULD YOU LIKE TO STUDY THE BIBLE ?
Why ?
*
“ It’s too hard . ”
Yet many of my spiritual questions went unanswered .
“ I tried reading the Bible but could not understand it .
So I decided to pray to the God of the Bible .
NAME : From the Greek word bi·bliʹa , meaning “ little books ”
WRITTEN : By about 40 writers over some 1,600 years , from 1513 B.C.E . to about 98 C.E .
In 2014 , over 8,000,000 Witnesses in 240 lands conducted nearly 9,500,000 Bible studies each month .
“ The course covered all my questions and many more . ” ​ — Bertha , Mexico .
“ The Bible study was held at my home at a time that I found suitable .
“ The lessons were sometimes 15 to 30 minutes long ​ — other times longer — ​ whatever was convenient for me . ” ​ — Viniana , Australia .
Many people set aside an hour or so each week to study the Bible . But the length of the study is flexible .
contains 19 lessons .
You can cover any or all of the lessons at a pace that suits you .
What I learned made me a better person .
But Jehovah’s Witnesses feel that it’s important to memorialize the death of Jesus .
Shirley : You mean the Last Supper ?
It’s also called the Lord’s Evening Meal .
“ Also , he took a loaf , gave thanks , broke it , and gave it to them , saying : ‘ This means my body , which is to be given in your behalf .
Keep doing this in remembrance of me . ’ ”
And right before instructing his followers to remember him , Jesus made it clear what they were to remember about him .
Megan : You’re not alone , Shirley .
Shirley : I have a few more minutes .
Shirley : Sure .
So there would have been no reason for anyone to die .
But as we know , things didn’t work out that way , did they ?
Shirley : No . Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit .
That choice would have disastrous consequences not just for Adam and Eve but also for all their offspring .
They would all be born in a sinful condition .
But there is more to it than that .
In his perfect justice , God determined that Adam and Eve should die for their sins , but we as their offspring were not left without hope . God made a way for us to get out of this predicament .
That is where the ransom sacrifice of Jesus comes in .
He must have been deeply hurt when his first two human children rebelled against him .
There’s another way too in which the ransom was God’s gift .
Megan : I see some toys here in the front yard . You must have children .
Shirley : Yes , I have two ​ — a boy and a girl .
I mean , how did he feel watching from heaven as his dear Son was arrested , ridiculed , and struck with fists ?
Shirley : Yes , it has .
How does Jesus ’ death make possible a society where people care for one another ?
Humans no doubt will continue to make scientific advances .
However , God purposes something better for the human family . ​ — Read 2 Peter 3 : 13 .
But by choosing to disobey God , the first human lost his perfection .
And yet God will use Jesus to restore humankind to perfection . ​ — Read Romans 7 : 21 , 24 , 25 .
Thus Jesus made possible a marvelous future when people will be free from the selfish tendency to do wrong . ​ — Read Psalm 37 : 9 - 11 .

How Elders Train Others to Become Qualified
PAGE 19 • SONGS : 91 , 11
What can elders as well as those who receive training learn from Samuel , Elijah , and Elisha of old ?
These two articles show us how we can strengthen our personal relationship with Jehovah by maintaining two - way communication with him and by trusting in him at all times .
POPULATION
BIBLE STUDIES
3 : 1 .
Circuit overseers have noted what situation in many congregations ?
This presents a challenge .
As a shepherd , you no doubt realize that personal training is important .
You also know that God’s Word urges you to “ teach others . ”
That being the case , let us consider what importance should be given to the training of others .
What could be one reason why some elders may find it hard to set aside time for training ?
If I have to postpone training for a while , the congregation will continue to function . ’
5 , 6 .
‘ If I don’t have time to change the oil , ’ he may reason , ‘ the engine will still keep running , at least for a while . ’
So just as the driver in the example makes sure to keep refilling the fuel tank , elders must “ make sure of the more important things . ”
Elders who take a long - range view and invest their time in training less experienced brothers are wise stewards and a true blessing to the entire congregation .
They strengthen the congregation’s defenses .
You must anoint him as leader over my people Israel . ” Samuel realized that his role as leader had come to an end and that Jehovah had assigned him to anoint a successor .
He invited Saul for a meal in a dining hall .
The next day , Samuel anointed Saul , kissed him , and gave him more instructions .
After that , he sent Saul away ​ — prepared for the events to come . ​ — 1 Sam .
Even so , Samuel did not allow bitterness or resentment against the man who would replace him to take root in his heart .
How can an elder prepare the heart of a learner , and why is taking that approach so important ?
Training others starts with developing a bond of friendship ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( Read Romans 12 : 10 . )
That unspoken message will be clearly understood and deeply valued by willing learners everywhere .
What methods could the elder use ?
Why ?
How can those who are being trained imitate Elisha ?
( a ) What have God’s servants long understood about training , and how does this apply today ?
Today , we are fighting a spiritual war against Satan and his followers .
Also , we are exerting ourselves in our effort to bring praise to Jehovah .
( b ) What effect may a prayer said by an elder have on the learner ?
To determine to what extent a learner’s thoughts and actions are influenced by Kingdom truth , you might ask him , ‘ How has your dedication to Jehovah changed the way you use your life ? ’
How upbuilding it will be for the brother to hear your heartfelt prayer in his behalf !
( b ) Why should elders train those who are still young ?
Though this may seem like a simple method , it is effective .
( b ) How important is it to commend a learner ?
Also , ask the learner to think of the elderly ones in the congregation and how carrying out his assignment will benefit them .
Having such conversations with the learner as part of his training will help him to focus more on people than on rules .
How important is it to do that ?
( a ) With regard to training , what challenge faces some elders in affluent lands ?
Elders in affluent lands may face an added challenge : how to motivate baptized brothers in their 20 ’ s or 30 ’ s to get involved in congregation activities .
Among the answers received , one stands out : While they were growing up , some young ones were not encouraged to pursue spiritual goals .
10 : 24 .
Promptly accept assignments , including humble tasks .
View your teacher as a friend , and let him know how much you appreciate the effort he makes in your behalf .
( See opening image . ) ( b ) What was it about Elisha that reassured his fellow prophets ?
The account of Elijah’s successor , Elisha , also indicates how brothers today can show due respect for experienced elders .
After Elijah and Elisha had visited a group of prophets in Jericho , the two men walked to the Jordan River .
There , “ Elijah took his official garment and rolled it up and struck the waters , and they were divided . ”
Clearly , Elisha did not think that by now he knew it all .
Again , the waters were divided . ​ — 2 Ki .
Apparently , Elisha did not feel that since he was now at the helm , he needed to change course right away .
What is the lesson for you as a learner today ?
( b ) In time , how may Jehovah use faithful learners ?
Do not feel that as soon as you receive some responsibility in the congregation , you need to use it to change course ​ — to do things in a way that is completely different from the way they were done before .
Just as Elisha by his actions reassured his fellow prophets and showed respect for his predecessor by continuing to use Elijah’s methods , you may reassure your fellow believers and show respect for experienced elders by continuing to use their Bible - based methods .
It is hoped that the suggestions in this article and the preceding one will move more elders to set aside time for training others .
Doing so will fortify the congregations worldwide and help each one of us to stay faithful during the momentous events to come .
These suggestions were tried with good results by elders in Africa , the Americas , Asia , Australia , and Europe .
LIFE STORY
That was in the village of Namkumba , near the city of Lilongwe , in the country that is now Malawi .
I remember with fondness the encouraging comments of those representatives from the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn , New York .
Assemblies strengthened us for the persecution ahead
Our assignments took us from the beautiful slopes of the Mulanje Mountains in the south to the peaceful shores of Lake Malawi , which runs nearly the full length of the eastern part of the country .
The following year , Brother Henschel visited Malawi again and a special convention outside the city of Blantyre was attended by some 10,000 .
I told my wife and children to hide among the nearby banana trees .
From there , I watched as our house and all our personal belongings were destroyed .
We fervently prayed to Jehovah for his help and guidance in this volatile situation .
An older woman came running and cried out : “ Leave them alone , please !
This man is my brother’s son .
Political party card
We escaped and ran to the home of an elder .
Another time , we were crossing a river in a boat .
The owner of the boat was the political chairman of the area , so he decided to check all the passengers for political party cards .
The next day , the chief of police took me to another room , where he wrote out a statement that said : “ I , Trophim R .
At the Lilongwe police station , I was treated kindly .
The chief of police said : “ Here is a plate of rice because you have been bound on account of God’s Word .
Later , things changed for the worse .
Another time , they wanted to know where our headquarters was located .
I explained that the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses is described in the Bible .
They read that passage three times .
We each received a two - year prison sentence .
So guards , don’t trouble them by asking them for a cigarette and don’t send them to collect a burning piece of charcoal to light your cigarette .
When it was dark or rainy , prisoners were not allowed to move about .
2 : 12 .
Regarding that period , we feel like the apostle Paul when he wrote : “ We do not want you to be unaware , brothers , of the tribulation we experienced . . .
We were very uncertain even of our lives .
1 : 8 - 10 .
However , that relationship is under attack by pressures not only from Satan’s world but also from our own imperfect flesh .
This trying situation faces all Christians .
Would you like to strengthen it ?
How can you communicate with God ?
For example , read and meditate on Jesus ’ words to “ stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth . ”
( b ) What should be our objective when engaging in personal study ?
It also deepens our appreciation for Jehovah’s endearing ways , causing us to love him even more .
25 : 4 .
( a ) What concern could arise regarding Jehovah’s treatment of King Azariah , as described at 2 Kings 15 : 1 - 5 ?
Should this disturb us or cause us to wonder whether Jehovah punished Azariah without due cause ?
Eighty - one priests confronted him and endeavored to correct him .
How did Uzziah respond ?
He “ became enraged ” against the priests .
Let us not miss the point .
11 - 13 .
We praise him , thank him , and seek his guidance .
Aside from any such benefits , how do you know that your sincere prayers are actually heard by Jehovah ?
Would he have taught his disciples to pray had he thought that prayer was nothing more than a psychological crutch ?
14 , 15 . ( a ) How do we benefit from being specific in our prayers ?
( b ) How did one sisterʼs prayers help her strengthen her bond with Jehovah ?
Answered prayers will make Jehovah more real to you .
In addition , the more you express your innermost concerns to Jehovah , the closer he will draw to you .
Today , I do not like field service ​ — I love it .
As a result , our ever - growing relationship with Jehovah will enable us to meet our trials successfully .
Thus , both are actively involved .
“ Trust in him at all times , O people . ” ​ — PS .
If you were a Christian back then , you would daily face the possibility of being arrested and tortured .
Would other Christians come to his aid ?
Paul may have had some initial concerns in that regard , for he wrote to Timothy : “ In my first defense no one came to my side , but they all forsook me ​ — may they not be held accountable . ”
Even so , Paul acknowledged that he had not been entirely without help .
Recalling that experience must have strengthened Paul , helping him to trust that Jehovah would fortify him to endure his present trials and any future difficulties that might arise .
4 , 5 . ( a ) From whom can you always receive needed assistance ?
It could have been lack of employment , pressures at school , a health problem , or some other distressing circumstance .
Therefore , rather than nurture resentment when human help appears to be limited , view such situations as the apostle did ​ — as opportunities to rely fully on Jehovah and experience firsthand his loving care .
Why might it be especially challenging to trust in Jehovah when we are under stress ?
Why ?
1 : 2 .
Yes , he will “ make the way out . ”
When relief does not immediately follow our prayers for help , let us wait on the One who knows just when to act in our behalf .
Remember that he too is exercising patience , for he is ever eager to come to our rescue .
10 - 12 . ( a ) How might circumstances become particularly difficult for a Christian who is caring for a chronically ill family member ?
Illustrate .
When under severe hardship , you may feel as did Paul ​ — that you are in or at least very near “ the lion’s mouth . ”
For example , suppose you are nursing a dear family member through a chronic illness .
32 : 8 .
You might receive conflicting opinions from doctors .

It taught me to rely on him rather than on myself or even on other people .
As a result , I have experienced working hand in hand with Jehovah . ”
Even within the family , trials may come that test our relationship with Jehovah ( See paragraphs 14 - 16 )
From your study of the Bible , you know how disfellowshipped ones are to be treated .
In this regard , think for a moment about the first man , Adam .
Why , then , did he disobey ?
Adam’s eating of the fruit that Eve offered him must have been because of his desire for his wife .
3 : 6 , 17 .
Does this suggest that we should not have strong love for our relatives ?
* Use this heartbreaking situation to make your relationship with Jehovah more real .
For what purpose was Paul “ rescued from the lion’s mouth ” ?
In what ways can we build trust in Jehovah and strengthen our relationship with him ?
If any situation makes us anxious , use it to draw closer to Jehovah .
See the February 8 , 1994 ; February 8 , 1997 ; May 22 , 2000 ; and January 22 , 2001 , issues of Awake !
Names have been changed .
See the article “ Why Disfellowshipping Is a Loving Provision , ” in this issue .
And what exactly leads to a person’s being disfellowshipped ?
For example , Jehovah insists that we avoid such serious sins as sexual immorality , idolatry , thievery , extortion , murder , and spiritism . ​ — 1 Cor .
Faithful servants of Jehovah in the past made such mistakes , yet God did not reject them outright .
King David is a prime example .
David committed adultery and murder ; yet , the prophet Nathan informed him : “ Jehovah . . . forgives your sin . ” ​ — 2 Sam .
God pardoned David’s sin because of David’s sincere repentance .
At first , we may feel that the decision to disfellowship the wrongdoer is drastic or even unkind , especially if we have close ties to that person .
Nevertheless , Jehovah’s Word gives us sound reasons for believing that such a decision is a loving one .
God’s good name is upheld if the people who bear that name make Jehovah’s moral standard their own .
The apostle Peter counseled Christians : “ As obedient children , stop being molded by the desires you formerly had in your ignorance , but like the Holy One who called you , become holy yourselves in all your conduct , for it is written : ‘ You must be holy , because I am holy . ’ ”
Clean , holy conduct brings honor to God’s name .
He said that he wanted to join an organization that “ does not tolerate bad conduct . ”
Jesus ’ description of the loving father who rejoiced at his son’s change of heart helps us understand Jehovah’s feelings .
Likewise , disfellowshipped ones who are no longer members of the Christian congregation ​ — their spiritual family — ​ may come to realize what they have lost .
“ Should the righteous one strike me , it would be an act of loyal love , ” said the psalmist David , and “ should he reprove me , it would be like oil on my head . ”
To illustrate : Imagine a hiker who succumbs to exhaustion on a cold winter day .
While waiting for a rescue party , his companion occasionally slaps him in the face to keep him awake . The slap may sting , but it could well save his life .
12 : 7 - 11 .
“ He was still my son , ” explains Julian , “ but his lifestyle had put up a barrier between us . ”
“ In the long run , despite the pain , it brings good results .
But olive trees have the remarkable ability to survive the elements .
“ There is hope even for a tree , ” Job said .
When rainfall breaks a severe drought , a dry olive stump can spring back to life with shoots rising from its roots , producing “ branches like a new plant . ” ​ — Job 14 : 7 - 9 .

9 The Bible Changes Lives
I Learned That Jehovah Is Merciful and Forgiving 10
True , there is much religious confusion on the subject and strange , gloomy notions abound .
Nonetheless , the Bible itself is quite clear about the end ​ — revealing what it is and what it is not .
First , though , let us clear up some misconceptions and establish a definition .
THE END IS NOT AN EPIC , FLAMING DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH .
The Bible reveals that the end is scheduled ​ — God has set a specific time for it .
Keep looking , keep awake , for you do not know when the appointed time is . ”
Clearly , God ( “ the Father ” ) has scheduled the exact “ appointed time ” when he will initiate the end .
What will bring about the end ?
“ [ God ] is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth . ”
THE END OF RELIGIONS THAT HAVE FAILED GOD AND HUMANS .
But what will you do when the end comes ? ”
“ Many will say to me in that day : ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and expel demons in your name , and perform many powerful works in your name ? ’ And then I will declare to them : ‘ I never knew you !
Note that the upcoming “ day of judgment and of destruction ” is compared with the destruction of “ the world ” of Noah’s time .
COVER SUBJECT
The Creator of humans and the earth wants you to know that his time to take action is approaching .
These features include major wars , food shortages , earthquakes in one place after another , an increase of lawlessness , a lack of love , and sly efforts by religious leaders to mislead people .
The time period when Noah lived was described in a similar way : “ The earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God , and the earth was filled with violence .
They have the weaponry in their hands .
And the earth is being ruined in another way . The systems that support life on earth ​ — the air we breathe , the animal and plant ecosystems , the oceans — ​ are steadily being degraded because of human mismanagement .
God’s Kingdom is being proclaimed worldwide in hundreds of languages
Nonetheless , there is ever - increasing evidence that we are at the conclusion of a unique period in the history of humanity .
Those scientists testified : “ A careful review of these threats leads us to conclude that the risk of civilization - threatening technological catastrophe remains high . ”
COVER SUBJECT | IS THE END NEAR ?
The Bible informs us that the end will involve destruction : “ There will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now . . .
We read : “ Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way , consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion , as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah . ”
Rather than following the majority today and ignoring the clear signals that we are living in such important times , we need to “ keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah . ”
It was like a drug for me .
By the time I was 14 , I excelled in devising ways to trick people .
One time , I made $ 10,000 in a single day !
However , I did pay many hefty fines for fraud , false representation , and selling without a permit .
The turning point came when my second girlfriend too started to study with the Witnesses !
She made changes in her life , and I was impressed that she was becoming milder and more patient .
I accepted an invitation to a meeting at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
When I read that verse , the gravity of my situation brought me to tears .
I realized that I needed to transform my life completely .
I was violent and aggressive , and my whole life was built on lies .
However , I also learned from studying the Bible that Jehovah is merciful and forgiving .
Finally , after I openly disclosed my troubled past during yet another interview , the interviewer said : “ I don’t really know why , but something tells me that I should hire you . ”
In time , both my wife and I were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses .
For the past 14 years , I have served in the full - time ministry , helping others to learn what the Bible teaches , and recently , my wife has joined me in the full - time ministry .
Over the past 30 years , I have had the joy of helping 22 of my coworkers to begin worshipping Jehovah .
The Bible describes the future Judgment Day as a happy time when Jehovah , the Judge of all the earth , will save mankind from injustice . ​ — Read Psalm 96 : 12 , 13 ; Isaiah 26 : 9 .
During Judgment Day , Jesus will bring such people back to life so that they might know and love the true God . ​ — Read Acts 24 : 15 .
The Bible also describes a day of judgment that will occur suddenly before the thousand years begin .

LIFE STORY
At that time , my future looked bleak .
Well , let me tell you some of my life story .

powerful ?
deceptive ?
2 , 3 .
More than anything else , Satan wants to see the end of Jehovah’s sovereignty .
The words “ the original serpent ” bring to mind that tragic day in Eden when Satan used a snake to deceive Eve .
What will be discussed in this article ?

He is what Jesus called him ​ — “ a murderer . ”

Time and again , the demons have demonstrated their superhuman strength , causing great misery to those whom they have tormented .
( See opening image . ) ( b ) From your own observation , how does this world reflect Satan’s vicious spirit ?
To him , the world might be a mere “ appetizer . ”
5 : 20 - 27 .
27 : 11 .
While Abraham and Sarah were in Egypt , Pharaoh had Sarah brought to his home ​ — evidently so that she could become his wife .
( Read Genesis 12 : 14 - 20 . )
The Bible does not say , but we have good reason to believe that the Devil would have been delighted to render Sarah unfit to bear the promised offspring .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Satan show his vicious disposition after the birth of Jesus ?
Jesus was born centuries after Abraham .
Indeed , Jesus was the primary part of Abraham’s offspring , the one who would later “ break up the works of the Devil . ”
And with regard to the child Jesus , Satan did not hesitate to act .
King Herod was greatly upset when astrologers inquired about “ the one born king of the Jews , ” and he was determined to kill him .
He certainly does not have a soft spot for children .
14 , 15 .
Through deception , Satan keeps people from becoming “ conscious of their spiritual need . ”
4 : 4 .
Even many who think that they are worshipping God properly are shackled to false beliefs and useless rituals .
Listen intently to me , and eat what is good , and you will find great delight in what is truly rich . ” ​ — Isa .
55 : 2 .
( b ) How might Satan deceive us regarding the matter of urgency ?
Because Jesus understood what was about to happen .
Relaxing his guard would have been precisely what Satan wanted him to do .
But the Bible assures us : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
How can we win our battle against such a daunting enemy ?
The Bible says : “ Oppose the Devil , and he will flee from you . ”
The following article will discuss three areas in which we can fight Satan and win .
5 : 9 .
To them , Satan and the demons are fictional characters of novels , horror movies , and video games .
Promoting the idea that spirits do not exist is one of the many ways that Satan uses to mislead people .
That war still rages as Satan seeks to destroy the faith of the remnant of the 144,000 and the other sheep .
How has Satan shown himself to be full of pride ?
Explain . ( b ) What kind of pride is dangerous , and what Scriptural examples illustrate this ?
But Satan must delight to see humans display boastful pride , for it echoes his own arrogance .
( b ) Explain how pride could disrupt a congregation’s peace .
Today , people manifest pride in a number of destructive ways .
How does the Bible help us combat racism and other forms of improper pride ?
( See opening image . )
10 , 11 . ( a ) Why might it be easy to develop love for the world ?
( b ) How might Demas have displayed love for the world ?
Satan is “ the ruler of this world , ” and it is lying in his power .
Of course , not everything the world offers is evil .
It could be that Demas began to love material things more than spiritual pursuits .
Jesus warned his followers : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
If we slave exclusively for Riches , we have stopped serving Jehovah , and that is precisely what Satan wants us to do !
To fight Satan , we must maintain a balanced view of material things . ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 6 - 10 .
Another trap of Satan’s world is sexual immorality .
For example , one famous actress stated : “ Monogamy is impossible for both sexes .
I don’t know anyone who’s faithful or wants to be . ”
Whether married or single , we must strenuously resist all forms of sexual immorality .
3 : 13 .
Acknowledge your weakness .
And when a temptation arises , reject it without delay . ​ — Gen .
Jesus knew God’s Word , and that made it possible for him to act quickly and quote scriptures in the face of temptation .
There are many more .
Nothing that any human can do will cause us permanent harm .
On the other hand , Satan’s prospects are bleak indeed .
After the destruction of his ungodly system , Satan will be abyssed for 1,000 years .
Consider this : When referring to the time that Gog is defeated , Jehovah says regarding Gog : “ I will give you as food to all kinds of birds of prey and the wild beasts of the field . ”
The Bible clearly shows that Satan will be abyssed for 1,000 years , not eaten or buried . ​ — Rev .
But how can Satan mislead Gog if he himself is Gog ?
When we compare all these Scriptural references about the final attack on God’s people , it becomes evident that the name Gog of Magog refers , not to Satan , but to a coalition of nations .
Similarly , the prophet Daniel , who was a contemporary of Ezekiel , says of the king of the north : “ Reports out of the east and out of the north will disturb him , and he will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction .
And there will occur a time of distress [ the great tribulation ] such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time .
This action on the part of God’s representative Jesus is also described at Revelation 19 : 11 - 21 .
During the final test at the end of the 1,000 years , those who rebel against Jehovah will manifest the same murderous attitude as ‘ Gog of Magog , ’ those nations that attack God’s people at the end of the great tribulation .
As keen students of God’s Word , we wait with eager anticipation to see who in the near future will assume the role of “ the king of the north . ”
7 : 14 - 17 .
No doubt , many faithful people of Bible times formed mental pictures of things God had promised .
Did Abel , the first faithful human , “ see ” anything that Jehovah had promised ?
It cannot be said that Abel had foreknowledge of the eventual outworking of the promise contained in God’s words to the serpent : “ I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring .
He will crush your head , and you will strike him in the heel . ”
Why would a mental picture of the future have encouraged Enoch ?
What could Noah continue to keep in mind after the Flood ?
What helped Abraham to demonstrate outstanding faith ?
Like Ur , they had shaky foundations because of their ungodly governments .
How may Sarah’s view of the future have benefited her ?
In effect , she saw her offspring enjoying blessings that Jehovah had promised .
What gave her such expectation ?
11 , 12 .
As Moses thought deeply about what Jehovah had promised to do for the Israelites , his faith and his love for God grew .
Although they have little in a material way , for instance , they dream of becoming fabulously rich and of being completely secure , although human life now is “ filled with trouble and sorrow . ”
You are healthy , energetic , and have a bright outlook .
Those supervising the work of restoration make life a pleasure because they genuinely care about you .
For example , you are helping newly resurrected ones to come to know Jehovah .
No , this is not a dreamworld .
This appealing mental picture is based on Scriptural truths about the future . ​ — Isa .
11 : 9 ; 25 : 8 ; 33 : 24 ; 35 : 5 - 7 ; 65 : 22 .
When we talk to other Christians about what we would like to do as Jehovah continues to fulfill his promises , our mental picture of the future becomes more vivid .
Our own faith in God and love for him may well increase as we use our ability to envision the fulfillment of what Jehovah has promised .
Why must we strive to control our thinking ?
What should we do to prevent it from harming us ?
Indeed , “ during all their distress it was distressing to him . ”
Just as a mother has tender feelings for her baby , Jehovah is moved to act lovingly in behalf of his people .
In a sense , Jehovah can put himself in the place of others , and he has given us that ability . ​ — Ps .
Like his Father , Jesus was loving and compassionate . ​ — Ps .
Because he felt pity for the crowd awaiting him , however , Jesus took time “ to teach them many things . ” ​ — Mark 6 : 30 , 31 , 34 .
Alan remembers Jesus ’ words : “ Just as you want men to do to you , do the same way to them . ”
Jesus ’ statement implies that we must ask ourselves , ‘ What would I want my neighbor to do to me if I were in his circumstances ? ’
Some are challenged physically because of injury , disease , or aging .
Still others are part of a religiously divided family or a single - parent household .
Everyone faces some problem , and often it is one we ourselves have not experienced .
What helped Jesus to show kindness ?
Give an example .
How can we imitate God’s kindness ?
In the ministry , a householder says , “ I’m too busy to talk right now . ”
Our being able to conceive of events that we have not lived through can also help us to imitate Jehovah’s wisdom and foresee the probable results of our actions .
Despite all that God had done for them , Moses knew that they would do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes .
To imitate God’s wisdom , we would do well to think about or even visualize the likely consequences of our actions .
22 : 3 .
But fire is deadly when it is uncontrolled and burns down a house and kills its occupants .
Similarly , contemplation is useful when it helps us to imitate Jehovah .
What way of life did Eve possibly picture in her mind ?
Eve’s sin in the garden of Eden did not involve sexual immorality .
Moreover , Paul warned : “ Do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh . ” ​ — Rom .
How happy we are when we have his approval because we have stored up “ treasures in heaven ” !
Jesus used an illustration to show that “ the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches ” can choke the word of the Kingdom .
Good words of encouragement from someone who understands us can make our heart rejoice .
Confiding in our parents , our spouse , or a trusted friend who views things from God’s standpoint may help to relieve our anxiety .
How does Jehovah help us to cope with anxiety ?
Let us therefore make good use of our God - given ability to imagine the hope ahead and imitate Jehovah’s love , kindness , wisdom , and happiness . ​ — Rom .
FEASTING together at Jehovah’s table has always been a theocratic highlight .
Overwhelmed by the throngs , waiters and waitresses quit en masse .
Sierra Leone , 1982
Working with fellow believers also helped many young ones to set spiritual goals .
At many of the large conventions , huge cafeteria tents housed rows of standing - height tables that encouraged diners to finish eating quickly and make room for others .
One person who was not a Witness remarked : “ That is a strange religion .
After inspecting our cafeteria at Yankee Stadium in New York City , United States Army personnel urged Major Faulkner of the British War Department to make a similar examination .
Therefore , he and his wife came to the 1955 “ Triumphant Kingdom ” Assembly in Twickenham , England .
Then , beginning in 1995 , delegates were asked to bring their own food to conventions .
Of course , many opportunities remain for volunteers to assist other convention departments .
As told by Kevin Williams
My posture , my eyes , and my sense of humor have all come from him .
They labored long hours in primitive conditions and tropical heat .
In 1843 , Thomas wrote : “ My heart was overwhelmed within me . . . .
I was on the edge of desperation . ”
Just before the house was completed , Mary gave birth to her second son , Thomas Whitton ( 3 ) Williams , my direct ancestor .
In 1883 , Thomas Whitton Williams and his wife , Phoebe , ( 4 ) moved their young family to Perth , Western Australia .
Violet became a full - time evangelizer , or pioneer .
No one ever collected the money .
His daughter Florence ( 6 ) served as a missionary in India .
Dubbed the Lady Williams apple , the new variety became a forebear of the Cripps Pink apple , one of the world’s most popular apple varieties .
He and Grandma served for years as volunteer workers on Witness construction projects in Australia and the Solomon Islands .
A popular music group named one of its albums Antichrist Superstar .
Martin Luther , German Reformation leader , labeled Roman Catholic popes as antichrists .
Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ ?
John mentioned “ many antichrists , ” indicating that the antichrist is , not an individual , but a collective term .
What else did John write regarding the antichrist ?
Hence , in the first century , false prophets and apostates were already at work , endeavoring to weaken the Christian congregation .
All those involved in spreading lies and religious deception about Jesus Christ and his teachings were included in John’s term “ antichrist . ”
Jehovah’s view of them was revealed when Paul described them as “ the son of destruction . ”
They deliberately spread lies and deceptions with the intent of confusing the identity of the Father , Jehovah God , and of His Son , Jesus Christ .
Let us look at two examples .
On the other hand , knowing God’s name , Jehovah , has helped many honesthearted worshippers to draw closer to God .
“ I was fascinated by the thought that God has a personal name , something I had never heard before . ”
From that point on , he made changes in his life to conform to Bible standards and to please Jehovah .

▪ Live in Harmony With the Model Prayer ​ — Part I
These articles show how we can live in harmony with such requests .
COVER : Faithful Witnesses use boats to reach some of the people living on islands of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago off the northwest coast of Panama .
1 : 24 .
What did Jesus show when he turned water into wine at a wedding feast ?
The four Gospels provide faith - strengthening details about some of the miracles that Christ performed .
For good reason , then , the apostle Paul could say about him : “ Christ is the power of God . ”
The number of guests may have been greater than expected . But whatever the case , the wine ran out .
What is evident is that at Cana , Mary and Jesus felt compassion for the newly married couple and wanted to save them embarrassment . Jesus knew that hospitality was a duty .
So he miraculously turned some 100 gallons ( 380 L ) of water into “ fine wine . ”
( Read John 2 : 3 , 6 - 11 . )
4 , 5 . ( a ) What lesson does Jesus ’ first miracle teach us ?
We show that we have learned from Jesus by generously providing material and spiritual things to others as we are able .
Poverty is not new .
Therefore , how heartening it is to understand that Jesus ’ miracles serve as portents of better times ahead under Kingdom rule when all will have plenty to eat and be satisfied !
Jesus ’ disciples came to him to discuss the food situation .
With five loaves and two fish , Jesus fed about 5,000 men , as well as women and children !
Are we not touched to think of the way Jesus used his miraculous power to care compassionately for entire families , including the little ones ?
Even some of our brothers , though having enough to subsist on , are not fully “ satisfied . ”
( Read Mark 4 : 37 - 39 . )
How has Almighty God shown himself to be capable of controlling the forces of nature ?
And we read at Jonah 1 : 4 : “ Jehovah hurled a strong wind at the sea , and there was such a violent storm on the sea that the ship was about to be wrecked . ”
When their full attention is directed toward the earth for the 1,000 years , all people will dwell in security .
Terrifying natural disasters will be a thing of the past .
For example , we may help them recover from a natural disaster .
“ I was especially fond of the sons of men . ” ​ — PROV .
8 : 31 .
What proves that Jesus has deep love for humans ?
What love he has for the human family !

Jesus thus demonstrated the kind of marvelous things that will soon take place earth wide .
Not surprisingly , woven throughout the fabric of Jesus ’ preaching tours were evidences of his genuine concern for the human family .
Let us examine four of Jesus ’ miracles .
The man had no doubt that Jesus possessed the power to heal him , but what he needed to know was , did Jesus have the desire to do so ?
Would Jesus be like the Pharisees , who had developed a heartless view of people suffering from this disease ?
And he healed people instantly , sometimes even from a distance .
What do these amazing examples show ?
Yes , Jesus will then act on his heart’s desire to help all afflicted ones .
A few months passed after Jesus ’ encounter with the leprous man in Galilee . His travels took him from Galilee into Judea to preach and declare the good news of God’s Kingdom .
The lives Jesus touched with his message and his manner must have numbered into the thousands .
Then the month of Nisan arrived .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What drew people to the pool of Bethzatha ?
What drew them to this location ?
The response was immediate .
How does Mark 5 : 25 - 34 highlight Jesus ’ compassion for those who suffer from sickness ?
Satan wants to convince us that we are unloved and worthless .
What a sympathetic King and High Priest !
3 : 8 .
( Read John 11 : 33 - 36 . )
Onlookers could see the affection Jesus felt for Lazarus and his family .
What compassion Jesus showed by using his God - given power to bring his friend back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 43 , 44 .
14 , 15 . ( a ) What indicates Jehovah’s strong desire to rid mankind of suffering ?
And it is not only that he can remember but that he and his Son want to do so .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What was evidently a major purpose of Jesus ’ miracles ?
Malachi 4 : 2 gives us reason to trust that the healed ones will “ skip about like fattened calves , ” excited and delighted to be released from confinement to imperfection .
These lifestyles are even promoted in advertising and entertainment .
Our confident reply is , Yes , with Jehovah’s help , true Christians can remain chaste . ​ — Read 1 Thessalonians 4 : 3 - 5 .
At that point , even a servant of Jehovah may be ready to act on his desire when an opportunity arises .
When we draw close to Jehovah in prayer , he draws close to us .
Our upbringing or our past conduct may have developed in us a liking for practices that Jehovah condemns .
How can God’s Word help to protect us from unclean thoughts ?
The wisdom contained in God’s Word is “ first of all pure . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) What led one young man to become involved with an immoral woman ?
At Proverbs 5 : 8 , we read : “ Stay far away from [ the immoral woman ] ; do not go near the entrance of her house . ”
The danger of disregarding this counsel is illustrated in Proverbs chapter 7 , where we read about a young man who goes for a stroll near the house of an immoral woman .
Even so , he has to live with the disastrous consequences of his actions .
For example , at night , television networks may relax their restrictions on program content . What if we occasionally channel surf ?
Why is flirting dangerous ?
When the wife of his master , Potiphar , tried to seduce him , Joseph rejected her efforts .
According to one Bible scholar , Potiphar’s wife was , in effect , saying : “ ‘ Let’s just be on our own together for a little , ’ in the hope of making [ Joseph ] take the first step . ”
39 : 12 .
The Bible also alerts us to the danger of allowing our eyes to lead our heart astray .
He failed to look away and to direct his thoughts elsewhere .
That led him to desire a woman who was someone else’s wife and to take steps to commit adultery with her .
We must solemnly decide to control our eyes and not allow them to gaze with immoral lust at another person .
If any of what has been presented so far has identified areas in which you could be more effective in your fight against wrong desires , take immediate action .
Of course , discussing with others problems of such a personal nature is not easy .
But courageously placing ourselves under the kindly scrutiny of a mature Christian may prevent us from rationalizing any wrong desires .
Illustrate . ( b ) Why is it good for those who view pornography to seek help promptly ?
Christian elders are especially qualified to help us .
He relates : “ I knew that my thoughts displeased Jehovah , but I was too ashamed to share with others what I was feeling . ”
They listened carefully to my problems .
The longer the delay in seeking help , the greater the risk that unclean desires will ‘ become fertile and give birth to sin ’ that will hurt others and bring reproach on Jehovah’s name .

He had already studied the Bible with several Witnesses , and his Braille copy of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life was well - worn .
Because of the background noise and Kingsley’s poor hearing , I had to raise my voice and speak much louder .
Kingsley was eager to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall , but this was not an easy task .
During meetings , Kingsley kept a speaker next to his ear , listening attentively and even commenting !
After he had studied for some time , Kingsley decided to enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School .
Two weeks before his first Bible reading , I asked him whether he had been practicing .
He confidently said , “ Yes , Brother , I have practiced about 30 times . ”
I congratulated him on his efforts and asked to hear the reading .
He had memorized the entire Bible reading !
He replied : “ No , I have practiced about 30 times per day . ”
Why ?
On September 6 , 2008 , after he had studied the Bible for three years , Kingsley symbolized his dedication to Jehovah by water baptism .
Why should we pray for God’s name to be sanctified ?
How might we use the prayer recorded at Matthew 6 : 9 - 13 in our ministry ?
The expression “ our Father , ” not “ my Father , ” reminds us that we belong to an “ association of brothers ” who truly love one another .
Christians whose hope is to live forever on earth can also address Jehovah as “ Father . ”
He is their Life - Giver , and he lovingly provides for the needs of all true worshippers .
Parents give their children a fine gift when they teach them to pray and help them to view Jehovah as a caring heavenly Father .
5 : 11 , 12 ; 91 : 14 .
What a privilege it is for us not only to know God’s personal name but also to bear it as “ a people for his name . ”
We do not want to be like some in the first century who did not practice what they preached .
After the untimely death of her husband , a sister in Norway was left alone with a two - year - old son .
Five years later , she married an elder .
Her son , now 20 years old , is a baptized brother .
For that to happen , Jehovah must act to remove all who willfully reject his sovereignty .
The article linked the “ seven times ” of Daniel’s prophecy with “ the appointed times of the nations ” spoken of by Jesus .
( b ) What are we privileged to do ?
The prophecy recorded at Revelation 12 : 7 - 12 explains why the birth of God’s Kingdom basically coincided with the beginning of the disastrous events that continue to plague mankind .
Jesus foretold : “ This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations , and then the end will come . ” ​ — Matt .
They do so by their way of life and by having a zealous share in the disciple - making work .
No doubt you can think of other good examples of individuals who pour themselves out in doing God’s will despite the limitations of old age . ​ — Read Philippians 2 : 17 .
How do you feel about what Jehovah will yet do in answer to our request for his will to be done on earth ?
Until the enemies of God’s Kingdom are removed from the earth , we will continue to pray for God’s will to be done .
Most resurrected ones will be “ the unrighteous , ” who lived and died without learning the truth about Jehovah God and his Son .
It will be a privilege to impart knowledge of God’s will and purpose to resurrected ones , thereby helping them to qualify for “ everlasting life . ” ​ — Acts 24 : 15 ; John 17 : 3 .
1 - 3 .
She feels that two of her specific prayers were answered .
She asked Jehovah to open the way for her to give a witness .
He was with his mother and grandmother , who were seeing him off on a flight to South Africa .
What needs will we consider ?
When we are suddenly faced with a problem , we may have no difficulty praying for help , and Jehovah is delighted to hear such pleas from his loyal ones .
Notice that this is a personal request not purely for “ my ” bread for the day but for “ our ” bread for the day .
Victor , a circuit overseer in Africa , explains : “ I often sincerely thank Jehovah that my wife and I don’t have to be seriously concerned about where our next meal will come from , nor do we have to worry about who will pay the rent .
He concluded by repeating this important advice : “ Never be anxious about the next day . ”
If we were to pray only for such physical needs , however , it would indicate an imbalance .
We have spiritual needs that are of much greater importance .
( See opening image . )
For our sin God could demand and exact our lives . . . .
Our daily need for forgiveness highlights the only legal basis on which God can cancel our sins ​ — Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
Usually , such sins are minor and give us an opportunity to show that we truly love our brothers and are willing to forgive , as God has mercifully forgiven us . ​ — Col .
Why is it important to have a forgiving spirit ?
If we talk about the matter , others may side with us , causing a division in the congregation .
( Read Matthew 6 : 14 , 15 . )
12 , 13 . ( a ) What happened to Jesus shortly after his baptism ?
Questions needed time to be settled .
For example , was something wrong with the way God created man ?
But Satan did not give up .
However , Satan attempts to ensnare Jesus ’ followers , including you .
Jehovah gives us his powerful holy spirit , which can strengthen us and help us to resist temptation .
God also forewarns us through his Word and the congregation about situations that we must avoid , such as spending excessive time , money , and energy on nonessential material things .
Espen and Janne live in an affluent European country .
With the birth of their first child , they had to stop pioneering , and now they have a second child .
Because Satan and his world cannot force us to do anything against our will .
But we can resist , even as thousands of our brothers have done . ​ — 1 Cor .
To survive the end of Satan’s world , what must we continue to do ?
Do you desire such a happy outcome ?
Yes , be determined to live in harmony with the model prayer .
AFTER Anita * was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , her husband became fiercely opposed .
“ He prevented me from going to meetings and forbade me even to mention God’s name , ” says Anita .
But what can help you to endure ?
Consider one example . Tragedy struck Ana’s family on a Monday afternoon .
She had to go back to work , which helped because her job required almost complete concentration but did not eliminate the pain she felt .
She is convinced that he did .
She says : “ The peace that only God can give soothed my soul and saved my sanity .
For example , during a time when the congregation in Thessalonica underwent severe persecution , Paul urged those Christians to “ keep encouraging one another and building one another up , just as [ they were ] in fact doing . ”
What a refreshing assurance !
There are yet other things we can do to endure .
“ Despite my fatigue , I made sure that our family maintained a regular spiritual routine , ” he reports .
What can we do yearly to prepare to commemorate Jesus ’ death ?
What circumstances in the first century helped the spread of the good news ?
However , we can look for lessons to be learned from individuals and events mentioned in the Bible . ​ — 3 / 15 , pages 17 - 18 .
In the last century , a fragment was found that contains portions of John’s Gospel .
During the rest of the week , I lived to party , abuse drugs , and commit sexual immorality .
I would use anything as a weapon to win .
It seemed that protesting did not satisfy my violent nature .
So I started participating in hate crimes .
For example , on occasion my friends and I saw films featuring the past suffering of African slaves in the United States .
They invited me to their congregation meetings , and I accepted .
The congregation was made up of many nationalities , but it was obvious that there were no racial divisions .
Initially , I did not want to study the Bible with the Witnesses , but I liked going to their meetings .
The next day , they bragged about the murder .
I resolved to change my life and start studying the Bible .
Even after I was baptized , however , I had to keep working on my temper .
In October 1974 , I began serving as a full - time minister , spending 100 hours each month teaching the Bible to others .
Rather , I believe that they are testimony to the transforming power of the Bible . ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
To this day , we are close friends .
You might reason , ‘ I’m not blameless or righteous , and I definitely don’t always do what is right . ’
Job was “ a blameless and upright man . ” ​ — Job 1 : 1 , footnote
Lot was called a “ righteous man . ”
However , let us take a closer look at the lives of those Bible characters .
The Bible says that what David did “ was very displeasing to Jehovah . ” ​ — 2 Samuel 11 : 27 .
Job , Lot , and David all made mistakes , some very serious ones at that .
Love of God and a desire to be obedient marked Job as “ blameless , ” Lot as “ righteous , ” and David as “ doing only what was right ” in God’s eyes .
So if we have bad thoughts that we wish had not come into our mind or say something we are ashamed of or do things that we later realize are wrong , let us take courage from the examples just discussed .

It will also show us why God’s people can face the great tribulation with full confidence .
Christians , however , have promised to be loyal to Jehovah .
3 They Offered Themselves Willingly ​ — In Russia
COVER : A group takes a lunch break during field service activity while working the interior sections of the vast Siberian territory
Still , the publishers were conducting several hundred Bible studies !
“ After that talk , ” says Matthew , “ I couldn’t stop thinking about Russia , so I prayed to Jehovah specifically about my desire to move there . ”
How did things turn out for him ?
Matthew
Despite those initial obstacles , Matthew says : “ Moving to Russia was the best decision I ever made . ”
Hiroo has now lived in Russia for 12 years and has served in several congregations .
I have learned to trust in Jehovah more in all aspects of my life . ”
In 2005 , Hiroo married Svetlana , and together they continue to serve as pioneers .
Says Matthew : “ The congregation that I visited had 200 in attendance , but the meetings were all conducted by one elder of advanced age and one young ministerial servant .
As a ministerial servant , he was assigned to care for the accounts , literature , and territory .
It’s the best way to spend my life ! ”
The two couples , along with many other willing workers , continue to assist the growing congregations .
That was not an easy living arrangement .
But Jehovah always helped me to see that I would benefit from continuing my service . ”
Preaching in areas where there is a great need for Kingdom publishers makes for a dynamic and exciting life . ”
They soon found people who were looking for Bible truth .
An elderly man opened the door and asked , ‘ Are you preachers ? ’
When we said yes , he said : ‘ I knew you would come someday .
For many hours we answered their questions and sang Kingdom songs with them , and we had dinner together .
“ After seeing that map , ” says Oksana , “ we realized more than ever that there is a great need for Kingdom preachers .
It helped us to make up our minds to move to Russia . ”
was helpful .
In 2008 , they moved to Russia .
This service strengthened our family . ”
And how has serving where the need is greater affected young Aleksey ?
If you decide to do so , you may soon feel like Yury , who said about his decision to serve where the need is greater : “ My only regret is that I did not do it earlier . ”
See The Watchtower , October 15 , 1999 , pages 23 - 27 .
“ I will glorify the place for my feet . ” ​ — ISA .
What is the “ paradise ” that the apostle Paul saw in vision ?
In the Hebrew Scriptures , to what can the term “ footstool ” refer ?
Besides referring to the earth , the term “ footstool ” is also employed figuratively in the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the ancient temple used by the Israelites .
What is God’s great spiritual temple , and when did it come into existence ?
It came into existence in 29 C.E . at Jesus ’ baptism when Jesus was anointed as High Priest of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple . ​ — Heb .
9 : 11 , 12 .
We thereby follow the example of the faithful servants of Jehovah described at Psalm 99 : 1 - 3 , 5 .
6 , 7 .
By 1919 , those approved by Jehovah and serving at his spiritual temple were clearly identified .
They had been spiritually refined in order to make their service to God even more acceptable to him .
( Read . )
It can refer to the physical , earthly Paradise yet to come .
The spiritual paradise serves to identify clearly those who have God’s approval and who are today serving him at his spiritual temple . ​ — Mal .
They know that their confidence is well - founded , a confidence all of us share .

Over the years , the older ones in our midst have personally experienced some of the organizational adjustments that have increased the beauty of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization .
Why ?
16 , 17 .
What recent adjustments have particularly impressed you , and why ?
18 , 19 .
It is an honor to be allowed by Jehovah to contribute to the beauty of our spiritual paradise .
26 : 15 ; 54 : 2 .
In that way , we make this paradise more appealing to onlookers .
How pleased Jehovah and Jesus must be when they observe our beautiful spiritual paradise today !
The enjoyment we have now in working to enhance its beauty is but a foretaste of the joy we will have later in working to make the earth a physical paradise .
What events similar to those in 66 C.E . will we soon face ?
IMAGINE that you are a Christian living in Jerusalem in 66 C.E . A lot has been happening around you .
Next , the Roman soldiers started to undermine the outer wall of the temple area !
No doubt you remember the words of Jesus as recorded by the Gospel writer Luke : “ When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies , then know that the desolating of her has drawn near . ”
Jesus also said : “ Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains , let those in the midst of her leave , and let those in the countryside not enter into her . ”
Then , an amazing thing happens .
How will the great tribulation begin ?
The clergy have prostituted themselves with the leaders of this wicked world .
Instead of loyally supporting Jesus and his Kingdom , they have given their support to human rulers and have compromised godly principles just to gain political influence .
And if someone asks him , ‘ What are these wounds between your shoulders ? ’
he will answer , ‘ Wounds I received in the house of my friends . ’ ”
The political “ ten horns ” will not be allowed to annihilate God’s people .
The majority of mankind will seek refuge in human organizations that are likened to “ the rocks of the mountains . ”
At that time , we will be the only ones following the example of the ancient prophet Daniel by continuing to worship our God no matter what . ​ — Dan .
This may well involve a declaration announcing that Satan’s wicked world is about to come to its complete end .
The Bible likens this message to hailstones when it says : “ Great hailstones , each about the weight of a talent , fell from heaven on the people , and the people blasphemed God because of the plague of hail , for the plague was unusually great . ” ​ — Rev .
16 : 21 .
( b ) How will people react to the signs that will appear in heaven ?
It seems likely that some events will overlap .
People will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth , for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .

25 : 46 .
But how will Christ’s brothers and their faithful companions react at that time ?
What will happen after Gog of Magog starts the attack on God’s people ?
Both Matthew and Mark record the same event : “ [ The Son of man ] will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds , from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity . ”
This gathering work does not refer to the initial ingathering of anointed ones ; nor does it refer to the final sealing of the remaining anointed ones .
13 : 43 .
However , the Bible clearly shows that “ the sign of the Son of man ” will appear in heaven and that Jesus will come “ on the clouds of heaven . ”
Additionally , “ flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s Kingdom . ” So those who will be taken to heaven will first need to be “ changed , in a moment , in the blink of an eye , during the last trumpet . ”
What reaction does this provoke ?
They will obey the instructions given in the days of King Jehoshaphat : “ You will not need to fight this battle . Take your position , stand still , and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf . O Judah and Jerusalem , do not be afraid or be terrified . ”
The apostle Peter was inspired to write : “ Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way , consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion , as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah . . .

See The Watchtower , July 15 , 2013 , pages 13 - 14 .
The fleshly bodies of the anointed alive at that time will not be taken to heaven .
In verse 1 , the days of old age are called “ the days of distress , ” or “ the calamitous days , ” ftn .
Even so , you are not doomed to a life of misery .
For example , Isaac , Jacob , and Ahijah lost their eyesight .
Sarah felt “ worn out . ”
We too need strong faith .
Today , 93 - year - old Ines suffers from a muscle weakness , but still she says : “ Every day I feel richly rewarded by Jehovah .
Every day I think about Paradise .
We strengthen our faith by praying , examining God’s Word , and attending Christian meetings .
And Jehovah always delights in your prayers , even if you are limited in what you can do . ​ — Prov .
Make good use of whatever is available to you .
Many who cannot attend meetings enjoy listening in by telephone .
1 : 11 , 12 .
Can you think of avenues of witnessing still open to you ?
Well into her 80 ’ s , she learned to use a computer to write letters .
He donated funds and organized support for the construction of a temple .
Similarly , you can take an active interest in what is going on in the Kingdom work worldwide .
As slaves in Egypt , they had likely made more bricks than they cared to remember .
Now they would become artisans of the highest order when they were assigned to take the lead in the construction of the tabernacle .
Does it matter who notices yours ?
But at the time they were fashioned , how many really saw their splendor ?
His opinion makes our prayers truly valuable .
The same is true of anything that we accomplish in our sacred service .
Why did Jesus not take sides in any controversy of this world ?
Why ?
The way that people resolve these issues , for better or for worse , might touch us or our families personally because we are inescapably a part of human society .
( b ) What will this article address ?
We are not swayed by efforts to involve us in exalting any portion of Satan’s world over another .
Because we are imperfect , though , some of us may be struggling to eliminate divisive attitudes characteristic of our former way of thinking .

When Jehovah through his Son created man and woman , his intent was that they fill the whole earth .
God designed humans in such a way that they could produce different races .
Controversy first arose in this regard in Eden when Satan challenged Jehovah’s rule .
In all sincerity , do you take Jehovah’s side by choosing to obey his laws and standards instead of doing things your own way ?
Your answers to these questions will determine how you respond when people ask your opinion on controversial matters .
Their efforts may be sincere and well - motivated .
Individuals in Corinth were saying : “ ‘ I belong to Paul , ’ ‘ But I to Apollos , ’ ‘ But I to Cephas , ’ ‘ But I to Christ . ’ ”
What was the solution to such disruptive thinking ?
Paul exhorted the Christians : “ Now I urge you , brothers , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you should all speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you , but that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought . ”
Neither should there be divisions of any kind in the Christian congregation today . ​ — 1 Cor . 1 : 10 - 13 ; read Romans 16 : 17 , 18 .
Their loyalties lie elsewhere .
( b ) What lesson can we learn from Zoila’s experience ?
Consider another example , that of Zoila . Originally from Mexico , she now attends a congregation in Europe .
But commendably , she sought Jehovah’s help to quash any negative reaction that arose in her heart .
Never would we want to say or do anything that could foment divisions or promote inappropriate loyalties among our brothers ​ — or among anyone else for that matter . ​ — Rom .
Researching these and related topics may prove to be a worthwhile project for personal study or family worship .
Sooner or later , all of Jehovah’s servants will find themselves in situations in which their conscience obliges them to stand out as different from those around them ​ — whether colleagues , classmates , neighbors , relatives , or others .
For our pleasure , Jehovah has created great variety in all things .
Some members of the congregation there may have had a form of Roman citizenship , which would have afforded them certain privileges above those of their brothers .

SONGS : 127 , 118
1 , 2 . ( a ) What places of worship have Jehovah’s servants used in times past ?
FROM early times , God’s servants have had their established places for pure worship .

Early Christians met in the homes of members of the congregation .
No Kingdom Hall can rightly be called “ the house of Jehovah ” in the same sense that these words applied to the temple in Jerusalem .

For example , a man in Turkey said : “ The cleanliness and orderliness that I observed at the Kingdom Hall impressed me .
The mayor attended .
“ The cleanliness of this hall reflects your true faith , ” he commented .
Of course , Jehovah wants his servants and other guests to feel comfortable there .
3 : 1 .
Jehovah’s organization goes to tremendous lengths to provide and help finance modest Kingdom Halls .
A congregation in Costa Rica that benefited from this provision wrote the following : “ When we stand in front of the Kingdom Hall , we feel that we must be dreaming !
127 : 1 .
Many brothers and sisters have experienced great joy in being able to participate in Kingdom Hall construction .
Thus , if people desire to be acceptable to Jehovah , they must also practice good hygiene .
In harmony with these principles , we should always feel comfortable inviting interested people to our meetings , confident that the condition of the hall will complement the good news we share with them .
They will see that we worship a God who is holy and who will soon transform the earth into an uncontaminated paradise . ​ — Isa .
6 : 1 - 3 ; Rev .
Some people may give more importance to cleaning than others do .
Each body of elders will need to make sure that a schedule is drawn up and that adequate supplies and equipment are made available for keeping the congregation’s place of worship in optimal condition .
King Jehoash of Judah ordered the priests to use contributions that had been made to the house of Jehovah “ to repair the house , wherever any damage [ was ] found . ”
What is your resolve concerning the buildings that we use for pure worship ?
By supporting these efforts , we show our zeal for Jehovah’s place of pure worship , as Jesus did . ​ — John 2 : 17 .
The natural cover of the highlands consisted mainly of Aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis ) , evergreen oak ( Quercus calliprinos ) , and terebinth ( Pistacia palaestina ) .

Hope for the Dead ​ — How Can You Be Sure ?
Imitate Their Faith
“ I Arose as a Mother in Israel ” 12
COVER SUBJECT | LIFE AFTER DEATH ​ — IS IT POSSIBLE ?
I knew I wasn’t good enough for heaven or bad enough for hell . It was not clear to me exactly what was in purgatory .
THE BIBLE’S ANSWER : “ The living know that they will die , but the dead know nothing at all , nor do they have any more reward , because all memory of them is forgotten .
How did the faithful man Job view the Grave ?
Clearly , Job did not understand the Grave to be a fiery hell , a place where his suffering would be even worse .
We can examine the inspired Scriptural records concerning eight people who returned from the dead . ​ — See the box “ Eight Resurrections Described in the Bible . ”
Not one of those eight spoke about being in a place of bliss or torment .
If the people who were resurrected had gone to such a place when they died , would they not have told people about it ?
In the Scriptures , nothing of the kind is recorded .
Can they awaken from this sleep ?
The son of the widow of Nain Jesus interrupted a burial procession outside Nain to resurrect a young man and restore him to his grieving mother . ​ — Luke 7 : 11 - 15 .
The most important resurrection , that of Jesus Christ , differed significantly from these eight , as the following article will show .
Jesus thus foretold the future time when , under the rule of his Kingdom , the Grave would be emptied .
“ It gave me real hope , and I started thinking about the future with optimism . ”
Job asked : “ If a man dies , can he live again ? ”
Then he confidently answered : “ I will wait all the days of my compulsory service [ time in the Grave ] until my relief comes .
You will call , and I will answer you . ” ​ — Job 14 : 14 , 15 .
But of Jesus ’ resurrection , we read : “ Jesus Christ . . . is at God’s right hand , for he went to heaven . ”
But what will those close followers of Jesus do there ?
The Scriptures tell us : “ Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection ; over these the second death has no authority , but they will be priests of God and of the Christ , and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years . ”
Those resurrected to heaven will rule as king - priests with Christ over the earth .
God’s Word assures us that billions who have died will live again
Where will Daniel awake from the sleep of death ?
All those who choose to serve God will have the prospect of living as long as Jehovah himself lives ​ — forever .
All who choose to serve God will have the prospect of living forever in complete health and happiness
* That is why Paul called Jesus “ the firstfruits ” ​ — he was the first one raised to eternal life .
Jehovah is the God of truth .
Jehovah has never lied , and he never will .
On another occasion , Jesus encountered the widow of Nain , who had lost her only son in death .
I can hardly wait to see my grandfather again . ”

3 “ Let the Many Islands Rejoice ”
POPULATION
PUBLISHERS
It was May 22 , 2000 . But why was this meeting so important ?
I was baptized in the Queensland outback in 1968 .
But my love of reading helped me in school .
Would I accept a scholarship to go to university ?
I still remember listening to a missionary give one of the talks in Hiri Motu .
Even though I could not understand a word of what he said , his talk motivated me to become a missionary , to learn other languages , and to give talks like that one .
Learning Tuvaluan was not easy .
This meant total immersion in the language and in village life .
How could they do personal study ?

These humble people needed spiritual food in their own language !
In 1980 the branch office assigned us to work as translators ​ — a work for which we felt totally unqualified .
I still remember the strong smell of ink and the effort required in the intense tropical heat to print all this literature by hand .
But sometimes help came from unexpected sources . One morning I called by mistake at the home of someone who was opposed to the truth .
It is not used that often in Tuvaluan . ”
Kingdom News No . 30 in Tuvaluan
The first piece of literature printed in Tuvaluan for distribution to the public was a Memorial invitation .

*
Composed pages were returned to us via air mail for checking and then sent back to the branch for printing .
In most cases , the corrected text is composed locally , producing files that can be sent to the printing branches via the Internet .
However , these faithful ones try to reflect Jehovah’s desire to get the good news preached “ to every nation and tribe and tongue [ or , “ language , ” ftn . ] and people . ”
One of the elders , who had a good job as a mechanic , offered to resign the next day and start immediately as a translator .
This was particularly heartwarming , since he was a family man and had no idea where his income would come from .
But Jehovah cared for him and his family , and he remained in the translation work for many years .
For example , at one point a question was raised as to whether it was worth all the effort to provide literature in Tuvaluan .
It seemed like a dream come true !
Now let me return to that presentation mentioned at the outset .
By the year 2000 , the Governing Body saw the need to strengthen translation teams worldwide .
Spiritual food is now available in one form or another in over 700 languages .
A few months after this , Bible translation was made part of the normal translation work , thus opening up the opportunity for the New World Translation to be made available in many more languages .
Interviewing my parents , Ron and Estelle , at a convention in Townsville , Australia , in 2014
With Loraini , witnessing in Fiji
Let the earth be joyful . Let the many islands rejoice . ” ​ — Ps .
77 : 12 .
( b ) With what need were all humans created ?
Before you answer that question , consider these examples : For several years , fellow believers kindly urged a sister named Taylene to be balanced and not to expect too much of herself .
Sandra struggles with an incurable illness .
At a convention , she was shown personal interest by the wife of a well - known brother .
Even small expressions of love from our brothers and sisters show me how much Jehovah loves us . ”
Humans were created with the need to love and be loved .
He designed the earth with an ecosystem in which we can safely exist and thrive .
Jehovah made sure that the earth could produce a seemingly endless variety of plants that can be prepared as wholesome food . Why , he even made eating a delightful and satisfying experience !
She remarks : “ It is truly amazing how everything comes to life ​ — flowers that are programmed to pop out of the ground and birds that return from their migration , including the tiny hummingbird that finds its way to the bird feeder outside my kitchen window .
For instance , the Scriptures tell us how he dealt with the Israelites , who frequently disobeyed him .
What can we expect of Jehovah ?
We can approach Jehovah in prayer at any time .
Jehovah hears our pleas and understands us even when no one else does .
Give an example .
4 : 6 , 7 .
What opportunity is open to humans because of the loving provision of the ransom ?
But God recommends his own love to us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”
( b ) those with the earthly hope ?
What are some ways that we can show our love for God ?
For example , we show love for God and neighbor by having a zealous share in the Kingdom - preaching work .
27 : 55 ; Luke 8 : 3 .
Are you not encouraged to know that Jesus feels so close to those who make sacrifices in order to follow him ?
Apparently , the women used their money , goods , or property to provide for their companions .
“ Even if it should delay , keep in expectation of it ! ” ​ — HAB .
SONGS : 128 , 45
Why should the passing of time not prevent us from keeping on the watch ?
How can we show that we are keeping in expectation of the end of this system of things ?
For example , Jeremiah prophesied that Judah would be desolated , and that is what occurred at Babylonian hands in 607 B.C.E .
Isaiah , who was inspired to foretell that Jehovah would bring about a restoration , declared : “ Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him . ”
Through the Messianic Kingdom , Jehovah will soon put an end to human suffering by destroying the wicked and delivering his people from this unstable world lying in Satan’s power .
After looking forward to the end of this system for what may seem to be a long time , however , some may wonder , ‘ Do we still have sound reasons to keep in expectation ? ’
Let us see .
Since Jesus did not say how long that period of time would go on before the end arrived , we need to be especially vigilant , watchful .
So we can expect that world conditions , bad as they are now , will continue to decline .
On the other hand , for the composite sign to serve its purpose , the fulfillment of it would have to be obvious enough to command the attention of those who have been obeying Jesus ’ counsel to “ keep on the watch . ”
And that has been the case since 1914 .
However , let us not allow the passing of time to weaken our resolve to keep in expectation .
They did so by intensifying their Kingdom - preaching work .
What did Habakkuk ask Jehovah , and how did God respond ?
In the new world , we will have reason to reflect on the fact that all the foretold events associated with the conclusion of the system of things did indeed take place .

We will surely be thankful that God , who ‘ has placed times and seasons in his own jurisdiction , ’ exhorted us to live with an awareness that ‘ the end of all things had drawn close . ’ ​ — Acts 1 : 7 ; 1 Pet .
( See paragraph 15 )
6 : 33 ; Mark 13 : 10 .
The sister recalled that one woman kept wailing : “ My suitcases !
My suitcases !
We keep the urgency of our preaching work in mind and help others to become survivors of the impending world catastrophe before it is too late .
As we await the end of the present wicked system of things , let us heed the disciple Jude’s inspired words : “ Beloved ones , build yourselves up on your most holy faith , and pray with holy spirit , in order to keep yourselves in God’s love , while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view . ”
( See opening image . ) ( b ) What spiritual blessings will there be in the new world ?
Think of how pleasant it will be to associate with our loved ones and friends , including those who have been resurrected !
73 : 28 ; Jas .
Learning about their customs would be beneficial .
In the new world , God’s sovereignty will be fully upheld .
It will be a pleasure to be under Jehovah’s arrangements in the new world as we work toward beautifying the earth , teaching resurrected ones , and doing Jehovah’s will for mankind .
( c ) We can be sure of what regarding life on earth in the new world ?
However , cooperation will bring us contentment and great happiness as we do Jehovah’s will wherever we live on earth at that time .
For instance , some members of the Bethel family in the United States have been reassigned to the field and are now enjoying abundant blessings in other forms of the full - time ministry .
What about our future prospects ?
Regardless of where we will then serve and what we will do , we can be sure that we will be grateful and contented , brimming with joy . ​ — Neh .
8 : 10 .
( b ) How can we show that we are patient ?
For example , we may hear of individuals who , to the delight of their relatives and friends , have been raised from the dead .
Learning to wait patiently for the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises now will help us to exercise patience then . ​ — Eccl .
During Christ’s Thousand Year Reign , it may take some time for the righteous and the unrighteous to shed imperfect traits .
Will we be able to deal lovingly with one another during that time ?
We are strengthening our faith in the reality of “ the inhabited earth to come . ”
Moreover , we are showing how deeply we yearn for the righteous conditions that will then exist on earth .
By making the ministry your career , you are preparing for continued service to God in the new world , where your theocratic training and experience will be of great value .
Participate in theocratic activities
Or we might strive to improve our understanding of Bible principles and their application .
Serving Jehovah is the most satisfying way of life there is .
Of course , we need not wait for the new world in order to enjoy spiritual blessings that result from wholehearted service to Jehovah ​ — they are available to us right now !
Indeed , some of us have been reaping such blessings for decades , and we know from experience that no other life course could produce greater satisfaction . ​ — Ps .
1 : 1 - 3 ; Isa .
How can we show that we are preparing for everlasting life in Paradise ?
May we show the intensity of our desire for the real life by preparing for it now .
Let us cultivate godly qualities and find great joy in sharing zealously in the Kingdom - preaching work that we have been given to do .
WE ARE living in very difficult times .
Moreover , the world will continue to deteriorate , for Bible prophecy foretold that “ wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse . ” ​ — 2 Tim .
3 : 13 .
For instance , the Internet , television programs , movies , novels , and magazine articles often present violence and immorality in a favorable light .
How are those who live by Scriptural standards often viewed ?
Furthermore , “ all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted . ” ​ — 2 Tim .
The Scriptures counsel those who want to do God’s will not to love this world and its practices .
Bad associations spoil useful habits . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
Instead , you must demolish them and smash their sacred pillars .

Such material is not designed to build faith in Jehovah and his promises .
For how long ?
“ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ” ​ — Ps .
In contrast with what the world produces , the material produced by Jehovah’s organization in these last days encourages conduct that leads to eternal life .
Or what sharing does light have with darkness ? ”
Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons .
For they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods ; then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you , and he will swiftly annihilate you . ” ​ — Deut .
You have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that I heard . ” But Solomon became a sad example of what can happen when a person ignores God’s command not to marry an unbeliever . ​ — Eccl .
4 : 13 .
What a warning that is for Christians who might think about marrying someone who does not love Jehovah !
What Scriptural counsel applies to a servant of God who is married to an unbeliever ?
What if someone becomes a worshipper of God while married to an unbeliever ?

Consider Noah , who lived in an evil world but had no desire to make its inhabitants his close friends .
He and the seven members of his family occupied themselves with the doing of God - given work , which included building an ark .
AS A boy , Antoine Skalecki had a pony or a horse as a constant companion .
On one occasion , Antoine almost lost his life in a cave - in .
Antoine was one of many children born in France to Polish parents in the 1920 ’ s and 1930 ’ s .
Why did Polish immigrants come to France ?
It was in Nord - Pas - de - Calais that many Polish residents first came in contact with the Bible Students , who had been preaching zealously in the region since 1904 .
By 1915 , The Watch Tower began to be printed in Polish each month , and The Golden Age ( now Awake ! )
Antoine’s family learned of the Bible Students through his uncle , who attended his first meeting in 1924 .
The sign reads “ Jehovah’s Witnesses ”
This was followed by increases of 20 , 23 , and even 40 percent in the years from 1948 to 1950 !
LIFE STORY
In an action film
Although I seemed to have everything to make me happy ​ — glamour , wealth , and a loving husband — ​ I was depressed and sad .
Sometimes we went to big assemblies .
My father’s way of life caused my mother a lot of grief , and she became deeply depressed .
For example , in 2002 , I met up with Cheri , an old acquaintance from Hong Kong .
She could find no consolation from her Buddhist religion .
My friend Cheri on a movie set
Excitedly , she told me that she had been driving and admiring the countryside when suddenly she started to pray out loud : “ Tell me , Who is the true God ?
That , she felt , was a reply from God , and she wanted to meet with Jehovah’s Witnesses as soon as possible .
“ I can tell them how I feel . ”
I was very pleased to hear that , because when Cheri was in the movie business , she never made friends .
By this time , I too was living in Hong Kong again .
I decided to reorganize my life to share more fully in teaching Bible truth .
Suffering that results from accident , illness , death of a loved one , natural disaster , or war can easily make people feel disappointed in God .
Mistakenly he blamed God , saying : “ I cry to you for help , but you do not answer me ; I stand up , but you just look at me .
Job did not know the source of his troubles nor why they came upon him or were permitted .
Happily , the Bible enlightens us on the reason why such events occur as well as how we should react to them .
Regarding God , the Bible tells us : “ Perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice . A God of faithfulness who is never unjust ; righteous and upright is he . ”
Adam and Eve certainly had no reason to be disappointed in God . ​ — Genesis 1 : 28 .
True is the description : “ All creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now . ”
The Devil told Eve that they would not die if they disobeyed God , thus accusing God of being a liar .
But , for a change , stretch out your hand and strike everything he has , and he will surely curse you to your very face . ”
Though Satan’s words were about Job , the implication was that all humans have selfish motives for serving God .
“ Stand Firm in the Faith ”

God’s servants should strive to grow spiritually , with the goal of reaching spiritual maturity .
We can learn vital lessons about faith from Peter’s attempt to walk on the Sea of Galilee .
▪ In What Ways Does Jehovah Love Us ?
In these two articles , we will consider ways in which Jehovah shows his love for us and how we can show our love for him .
Our mobile displays near famous monuments attract hundreds of people every month
PUBLISHERS
“ Attain . . . the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ . ” ​ — EPH .
When Paul wrote his letter , the congregation in Ephesus had already existed for some years .
Many disciples there had reached a high level of spiritual development . Some , however , still needed to press on to maturity .
Many brothers and sisters have long served God and have advanced to spiritual maturity .
What about you ? ​ — Col .
How so ?
A mature servant of Jehovah builds his life around the example of Jesus , who left a model for us “ to follow his steps closely . ”
A mature Christian strives to live in harmony with that counsel .
They can help him to handle difficult situations without becoming irritated and to endure heartbreaking disappointments without losing hope .
Jesus Christ had an excellent grasp of God’s Word .
Do you follow a routine of personal study , making every effort to set aside time each week for family worship ?
As you consider God’s Word , be alert to Scriptural principles that will help you to see more clearly how Jehovah thinks and feels .
Then try to apply Bible principles , relying on them when you make decisions , thus drawing ever closer to Jehovah .
How does a mature Christian’s knowledge influence him in everyday life ?
One reflection of such love is the setting of priorities in life that are in accord with Jehovah’s will rather than human inclinations .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How does Ephesians 4 : 15 , 16 highlight the need to promote unity in the congregation ?
( b ) How did one brother overcome a weakness and thus learn to work toward unity ?
( Read Ephesians 4 : 1 - 6 , 15 , 16 . )
Or what if you personally are wronged by someone in the congregation ?
Or do you try to construct a bridge across the gap between the two of you ?
But David never allowed the conduct of others to dampen his love for Jehovah .
But in choosing close friends , Jesus was selective .
He said to his faithful apostles : “ You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you . ”
Over the years , they may have had some ups and downs in life and may even have faced challenges in serving God .
Helga discussed the situation with friends in her congregation .
Now , years later , I am happy that I focused much of my youth on Jehovah’s service .
Jesus encouraged his followers : “ Let your light shine before men , so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens . ” ​ — Matt .
1 : 5 .
How can our conscience come into play as to health care ?
We would likely hear of even more evil than we do now .
Our study of the Bible should gradually give us an ever more precise picture of Jehovah , his personality , his qualities , and what he likes or dislikes .
With those questions in mind , let us consider three areas in which our conscience can be a positive factor : ( 1 ) health care , ( 2 ) recreation , and ( 3 ) the ministry .
Branch offices regularly receive letters from brothers and sisters who are considering one form of treatment or another .
How can we make decisions about medical treatments ?
For example , a Christian needs to remember the Biblical command “ to keep abstaining from . . . blood . ”
This knowledge could even influence a Christian’s conscience when he makes a personal decision regarding minor fractions derived from one of those four components .
For some illnesses , there may be no known cure .
Why should we respect the personal decisions of others ?
( See opening image . )
If we cannot understand the conscientious decision of a fellow believer on some personal matter , we should not quickly judge him or feel that we ought to pressure him to change his mind .
On the other hand , it may be that we need to examine our own conscience , which may need further training in line with divine principles .
The Scriptures warn against certain behavior identified as “ the works of the flesh . ”
How can the advice at 1 Timothy 4 : 8 and Proverbs 13 : 20 help us with regard to recreation ?
Many have concluded that a measure of regular exercise promotes good health and refreshes the body and mind .
Does this not suggest that we should be selective in our choice of recreation , guided by our Bible - trained conscience ?
How did one youth act in harmony with Romans 14 : 2 - 4 ?
Christian and Daniela are the parents of two teenagers .
One of our daughters complained that during recess at her school , some Witness youths behave in a way that she thought was not proper .
And she felt under pressure to behave in the same way .
To my surprise , he was very friendly and offered me the chance to speak to the whole class on the subject of creation . ”
Does your conscience similarly move you to do what is right ?
He looked at the windstorm and became afraid .
14 : 24 - 32 .
16 : 13 .
Why did Peter climb out of the boat , and how have we done something similar ?
Jesus had called him , and Peter trusted that God’s power would support him just as it was supporting Jesus .
Just as Peter’s faith enabled him to walk on water , our faith enables us to do things that from a human standpoint may seem impossible .
Once our faith moved us to dedicate ourselves to Jehovah , we became his friends , something we could never have done in our own power . ​ — Eph .
Our faith continues to empower us .
Jehovah says that when our faith moves us to put Kingdom interests first , he will provide for our material needs .
Recall that Peter did not sink because of a gust of wind or a big wave .
Think back on the sequence of events : “ Looking at the windstorm , he became afraid . ”
Do God’s promises seem less real to me now than they once did ?
God promises to forgive us on the basis of the ransom .
Consequently , we could lose our joy in God’s service and become inactive .
The apostle Paul showed that working hard for Jehovah leads to our having “ the full assurance of the hope down to the end . ”
How so ?
When he told them to forgive even those who had sinned against them repeatedly , they begged : “ Give us more faith . ” ​ — Luke 17 : 1 - 5 .
Why should we not be disheartened if we detect some weaknesses in our faith ?
Even Peter , an apostle , gave way to fear and doubt .
Keep in mind that an important lesson we learn from Peter’s experience comes from what he did after his faith wavered and he started to sink into the sea .
When Peter looked at the storm and started to sink , he could have tried to make it back to the boat on his own .
Just as Peter refocused on Jesus , we too must “ look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith , Jesus . ”
( Read Hebrews 12 : 2 , 3 . ) Of course , we cannot literally see Jesus as Peter did .
By focusing on Jesus ’ example and following his footsteps closely , we can be made firm in the faith ( See paragraph 15 )
He was never distracted by what the world could offer .
Make a list of people whom you look forward to meeting when they are resurrected and what you would like to discuss with them .
Pray for more faith .
We should follow his example because helping others build up their faith also strengthens our own .
his care for our physical needs ?
According to the apostle John , how has God shown us the way to love him ?
The apostle Paul said : “ God recommends his own love to us in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”
According to the prophet Micah , that is what Jehovah wants from us . ​ — Read Micah 6 : 8 .
When you receive a gift , what do you do ?
In addition , you will likely make good use of the gift , not taking it for granted .
Their continuing to receive such blessings , however , was contingent on their obeying God’s Law , which included regularly offering to Jehovah “ the best of the first ripe fruits ” of the land .
This is certainly a fine way to express love for Jehovah , whether we have much or little materially .
He said that the Father knows what we really need .
A Christian named Mike showed such love and trust .
When he was young , Mike started to develop a strong desire to serve God in a foreign land .
Encouraged by the many articles and reports about serving where the need is greater , Mike and his family decided to simplify their life .
They sold their house and moved into an apartment .
As reflected in King David’s case , what can meditating on the truth about Jehovah do for us ?
Then , touched by the wisdom of God’s Law , he said : “ The law of Jehovah is perfect , restoring strength . The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy , making the inexperienced one wise . ”
What should love for God move us to do with the abundant knowledge of Scriptural truth that he provides today ?
The Bible , however , urges us not only to love knowledge but also to acquire wisdom and understanding . That means to learn how to use the knowledge that God has given us so that we can benefit ourselves and others .
Shannon relates that when she was 11 years old , she and her 10 - year - old sister attended the “ Godly Devotion ” District Convention with their parents .
During one session , the young ones were asked to sit in a special section .
How , though , should we respond ?

For some , that can be a real challenge .
In the days of Malachi , many Jews did not appreciate God’s counsel .
In the world today , what is one common attitude that we must guard against ?
Through his organization , Jehovah gives us timely counsel about many areas of life ​ — our conduct with the opposite sex , our associations , and our recreation .
Spiritually , it is similar . Jehovah has given us his spirit , stimulating in us “ the desire and the power to act . ”
Yet , it would reflect a serious lack of love and trust for us to make decisions without taking his will into consideration . ​ — Phil .
As told by Melita Jaracz
As you can imagine , all in our farm family had chores .
My distraught parents asked the local priest , “ Where’s Johnny ? ” The priest said that the baby had not been christened , so he was not in heaven .
Mom and Dad were comforted to learn that the Bible says that the dead are asleep and that there will be a future resurrection . ​ — Eccl .
9 : 5 , 10 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
I’m so grateful for how we were trained to preach !
In 1942 , Eva and I were baptized .
Despite much pressure from Miss Scott , my teacher said firmly , “ This is my decision . ”
Miss Scott replied : “ No , it is not your decision .
In that way I supported myself in full - time service .
In 1955 , I wanted to attend the “ Triumphant Kingdom ” assemblies in New York City , U.S.A . , and Nuremberg , Germany .
He was a very dedicated person , serious in his devotion but kind and friendly in his disposition .
Something I particularly respected about Ted was that he never took his relationship with Jehovah for granted .
I always knew when a serious matter was weighing on Ted’s mind . He would get out of bed , kneel down again , and silently pray at length .
In 1974 , to our great surprise , Ted was invited to become a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses .

Ted and others at the Ministry of Justice in Moscow after our work received official registration
The following year , larger conventions were held , mostly in rented halls .
In 2007 we were on our way to attend a branch dedication in South Africa .
In England , Ted had trouble with his blood pressure , and a doctor advised him to postpone his trip .
Ted’s recovery was slow , and initially he was not able to go to the office .
We were grateful , though , that his speech was normal .
Despite his limitations , he tried to keep up his routine , even participating in the weekly Governing Body meetings by telephone from our living room .
After so many busy , happy years with my husband , adjusting to the present challenges has not been easy .
The Bethel routine is not easy , but it is a source of joy to be able to serve God in this way .
And my love for the preaching work has in no way diminished .
10 : 22 .
Is Anyone Listening ?
Why God Invites Us to Pray 5
“ I was a heavy gambler .
I pray for forgiveness of sins and to be a better Christian . ” ​ — Magdalene , Ghana .
In fact , surveys show that even some with no religious affiliation pray regularly .
Whether you are in the habit of praying or not , you may wonder : ‘ Does it really do any good to pray ?
Are people who pray just going through a meaningless exercise or , at best , getting some therapeutic benefit from the practice ?
In contrast , the Bible presents prayer as much more than just a form of therapy .
It tells us that someone really is listening to prayers that are made in the right way and for the right things .
Yet , the Bible assures us that there is a personal God and that he does hear prayers .

Other examples can be found at Daniel 9 : 21 and 2 Chronicles 7 : 1 .
It was as if I began to lose my desire to smoke .
I was able to stop . ”
Might God be interested in helping you with your personal concerns that are in harmony with his will ?
COVER SUBJECT | DOES IT DO ANY GOOD TO PRAY ?
Friends communicate with each other to cultivate a good relationship .
Likewise , God invites us to talk to him , opening the way for a warm friendship .
He says : “ You will call me and come and pray to me , and I will listen to you . ”
The more we pray to him , the more our friendship with God will flourish .
Yes , God invites you to pray because “ he cares for you ” and wants to help you .
The Bible tells us : “ Do not be anxious over anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving , let your petitions be made known to God . ” ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 .
Jesus said : “ Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . ”
If we accept God’s invitation to pray to him , what benefits may we expect ?
A 2012 Pew Research Center survey revealed that 11 percent of atheists / ​ agnostics in the United States pray at least once a month .
Praise “ I will praise Jehovah at all times ; his praise will be on my lips constantly . ” ​ — Psalm 34 : 1 .
Before you embark on any endeavor , you might naturally wonder , ‘ What’s in it for me ? ’
Not necessarily .
So , what can we expect if we make prayer a part of our life ?
“ Throw your burden on Jehovah , and he will sustain you . ” ​ — Psalm 55 : 22
I know that Jehovah will help me to take care of them . ”
Are you facing extreme stress , perhaps even life - threatening or tragic circumstances ?
For instance , on one occasion when Jesus was greatly distressed , “ he bent his knees and began to pray . ”
“ An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him . ”
He prayed : “ Now , I pray , strengthen my hands . ”
Some decisions we make can permanently affect us and our loved ones .
If we pray for wisdom , God can use his holy spirit to guide us to make wise decisions .
Even Jesus felt the need to ask his Father for help when making important decisions .
She says , “ I depend on Jehovah’s help through prayer . ”
( For more examples , see the box “ Benefits of Prayer . ” )
For more information , contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally or visit our website , www.jw.org .
Help to avoid temptation “ Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 40 .
Forgiveness of sins “ If my people on whom my name has been called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn away from their evil ways , then I will hear from the heavens and forgive their sin . ” ​ — 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 .
Herod’s engineers enlarged the flat area north of the temple in order to expand the terraces there .
Herod tried not to offend Jewish sensibilities or disrupt the temple’s services and sacrifices .
The goddess of justice ( left ) beating the goddess of injustice
At that , the islanders said : “ Surely this man is a murderer , and although he made it to safety from the sea , Justice did not permit him to keep on living . ” ​ — Acts 28 : 4 .
The Greek term for “ Justice ” here is “ di’ke . ”
How will God bring about a world without poverty ? ​ — Matthew 6 : 9 , 10 .
It would take a world government to end poverty .
God has promised such a world government . ​ — Read Daniel 2 : 44 .
As the foretold “ Prince of Peace , ” Jesus will establish world peace and security .
For more information , see chapter 8 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses
BIBLE PRINCIPLE : “ Continue . . . forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another .
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you , you must also do the same . ” ​ — Colossians 3 : 13 .
Hence we are wise to be inclined to forgive others , for sooner or later we will need to have others forgive us .
A report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , by Dr . Yoichi Chida and Professor of Psychology Andrew Steptoe , concluded : “ The current findings suggest a harmful association between anger and hostility and CHD [ coronary heart disease ] . ”

“ Give Us More Faith ”
▪ Serve Jehovah Without Distraction
CONGREGATIONS
66 : 14 .
What about us ?
Jehovah miraculously delivered his people out of Egypt , and then king after king fell before them .
Israel’s opponents refused to acknowledge that God was fighting for Israel , and that led to their defeat .
For example , unlike most of the nations who fought against Israel in Joshua’s time , the Gibeonites made peace with Israel .
They wisely recognized Israel’s backer to be the true God .
Rahab too perceived God’s hand in the events of her day .
To them , that was an obvious conclusion !
Nonetheless , do we really have evidence that God is active in people’s lives today ?
As a teenager , she had studied the Bible with the Witnesses but had lost contact with them when she got married and moved to that island .
Within a year , she dedicated her life to Jehovah .
Many of God’s servants have seen evidence of his help when they broke free from such addictive habits as smoking , drug abuse , or the viewing of pornography .
When the electricity came back on , Amy picked up a Watchtower magazine with an article on a Gilead graduation program that discussed all the things she was struggling with : new culture , homesickness , new people to get along with .
She says : “ I felt that Jehovah was speaking to me that night .
So as a whole , we have abundant proof that God is working in behalf of his people .
( Read Isaiah 66 : 14 . )
Do you clearly see Jehovah’s hand in your life ?
Explain why we at times may not clearly see Jehovah’s hand in our life .
What was the solution to Elijah’s problem ?
Job got so distracted by his own concerns that he neglected to see things from God’s viewpoint .
In the light of the Scriptures , we need to meditate on what is happening around us .
I was awestruck ! ”
How can we be “ pure in heart ” ?
We must be clean on the inside and stop any wrong conduct .
“ Help me out where I need faith ! ” ​ — MARK 9 : 24 .
HAVE you ever thought , ‘ Am I the kind of person Jehovah will want to save during the great tribulation and bring into the new world ? ’
This may sound very basic , but the truth is that “ faith is not a possession of all people . ”
These texts help us understand how important it is to cultivate strong faith .
( b ) What questions will we now consider ?
The apostle Peter drew special attention to the importance of faith when he spoke of its “ tested quality ” that “ may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ . ”
Or we may be moved to say , as did Jesus ’ apostles : “ Give us more faith . ” ​ — Luke 17 : 5 .
The need for more faith raises some questions .
*
When Jehovah’s time came to end the drought , even before there was any sign of rain , Elijah told Ahab : “ Go up , eat and drink , for there is the sound of a heavy downpour . ”
Do not such accounts make us examine ourselves to see if our faith is that strong ?
Illustrate how we can keep our faith strong .
How do the following help build faith : ( a ) good association ?
( Read Hebrews 10 : 24 , 25 . )
As we sense how Jehovah helps us in life and how he answers our prayers , our faith grows .
No wonder Joshua spoke so strongly to the Israelites , saying : “ Not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . ”
He later added : “ Therefore , fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness . . .
As for me and my household , we will serve Jehovah . ”
What does James show is necessary regarding faith ?
Our actions will show that we have real faith .
Sharing in the preaching work is an excellent way to demonstrate our faith .
Jesus said that we can pray for material things , including “ bread according to our daily needs . ” Bible accounts convince us that Jehovah can provide for us .
We show faith as we grapple with the challenges of daily life ( See paragraph 14 )
Rebecca says that at one point her husband felt that the nature and pressure of his secular work might endanger their spirituality , so he resigned .
Paul , quoting the inspired words of Habakkuk , wrote : “ The righteous one will live by reason of faith . ”
Therefore , it is vital that we put faith in the One who can really help .
Jehovah’s servants do all they can to carry out the will of God , but knowing their limitations , they trust in Jehovah to bless the outcome .
Are we not glad that our God is with us ?
( a ) How was the apostles ’ request for faith answered ?
The Bible assures us that we can when “ we ask according to [ God’s ] will . ” ​ — 1 John 5 : 14 .
LIFE STORY
Despite challenges and difficulties , he always remained faithful and had an extraordinary zest for life .
He was born in 1926 to a peasant family in the village of Podvirivka , located in the Chernivtsi Oblast , Ukraine .
I was surprised to learn that the Devil , not God , is the source of all the trouble in the world .
Along with the publications , I read the Gospels and realized that I had found the truth .
It was wartime , and I was not about to kill anyone .
We resolutely told the authorities that we would not participate in the war .
20 : 13 .
Charred trees lined the road .
“ The war ended in 1945 , but we were still sentenced to ten years in prison for refusing to fight .
Because I was actively preaching , the Soviet security agency wanted to send me to prison again .
At this time , most of our printing was done in secret underground locations .
“ One day , a brother with whom I worked asked me , ‘ Nikolai , have you been baptized ? ’
At that time , brothers who were still free were appointed to replace those who had been arrested , and the Kingdom work continued . ”
“ The underground printing work was much more difficult than prison !
I saw my family only when I went to visit them , which was seldom .
One of my pursuers jumped on a horse and kept shooting at me from horseback until he ran out of ammunition .
One shot hit me in the arm .
One time I could not even attend an important meeting with other brothers because I was bleeding from my nose and mouth . ”
Six months later the Supreme Court of Ukraine announced the verdict .
After examining some of our confiscated magazines , one guard exclaimed : ‘ If you continue to read them , you will be invincible ! ’
What we need is your loyalty and allegiance . ’ ”
“ We always put in an honest day’s work and often did more than we were assigned to do ”
After being released from the labor camp in 1967 , Uncle Nikolai helped organize congregations in Estonia and St .
Today , two flourishing congregations meet there .
IF A person could not trust everything that was written in a newspaper over 200 years ago , the same applies to much of what can be read on the Internet in the 21st century .
If a news item seems unbelievable , it probably is .
Furthermore , when the information discredits others , think about who would benefit from such news being spread and whether the source has ulterior motives in spreading it .
Jesus , who was the object of false accusations , warned his followers that enemies would persecute them and “ lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against [ them ] . ”
We also have to be careful about news or experiences of a spiritual nature that we receive secondhand .
For example , it is neither loving nor upbuilding to spread gossip , even though the information may be true .
Spreading information ahead of time can do much harm .
As the Bible says , “ the naive will inherit foolishness , but the shrewd are crowned with knowledge . ” ​ — Prov .
See Our Kingdom Ministry , April 2010 , “ Question Box . ”
Is this information from a reliable source ?
“ Mary . . . kept listening to what [ Jesus ] was saying .
How did both Martha and Mary set a fine example for us ?
WHAT comes to mind when you think about the Bible character Martha ?
Why , then , is Martha mentioned in this way in the Gospel account ?
What lesson can we learn from this account ?
In response to their hospitality , Jesus is moved to give Martha and Mary a spiritual gift .
“ Distractions , ” said The Watchtower of September 15 , 1958 , “ will likely increase as this world nears its doom . ”
Today , computer technology and the Internet are being used in a powerful way to spread the good news , reaching people on remote islands and in every corner of the earth .
As the Bible warns , there is a danger in making too much use of what the world has to offer .
Why is the counsel not to be loving the things in the world so important ?
( Read Matthew 6 : 22 , 33 . )
But how did Jesus react to this flattering request ?
What did Jesus say to a man who had a family dispute , and what warning did Jesus give ?
But Jesus refused to be drawn into this dispute .
He had much work to do , and he faced a humiliating trial and a cruel death .
No doubt , Philip carried this positive message back to the inquirers . ​ — John 12 : 20 - 26 .
Though Jesus refused to be distracted from his main purpose of preaching the good news , he was not always thinking about work .
He focused on “ the more important things ” and slaved in God’s service , traveling back and forth between Syria , Asia Minor , Macedonia , and Judea .
Relate an experience .
Like Paul , some servants of God choose to remain single so that they have fewer family responsibilities and can devote themselves to Kingdom service .
Married servants of God often have more extensive family responsibilities .
( The Watchtower , March 1 , 2006 ) They gave up a profitable business in Australia to enter full - time service .
In what important ways is the human brain unique ?
Because our brain is unique , we are able to learn a language .
Man’s linguistic abilities are a miraculous gift designed by God .
To all who desire to honor the Creator of language , God has given a wonderful gift , the Bible .
It is available in whole or in part in over 2,800 languages .
When you read , what may help you to improve your understanding and your ability to remember what you read ?
When getting to the end of a paragraph or before starting a new subheading in a publication , you might pause and ponder over what you have just read to be sure that you understand it correctly .
How can this be avoided ?
When is the best time to meditate on God’s Word ?
That is why the imperfect human brain is inclined to switch to easier , less demanding tasks .
Reflecting on what you read in the Bible is one important way to meditate , but there are others .
This will no doubt move you to praise Jehovah for his goodness and ​ — if you are with a companion — ​ to share your appreciative feelings .
( b ) How can we apply Paul’s counsel when we prepare for our ministry ?
For example , we need time to meditate as we prepare to conduct a Bible study .
The same is true when we prepare our heart to go out in the field service .
All such preparation will move us to witness effectively “ with a demonstration of spirit and power ” from the Word of God . ​ — 1 Cor .

What additional opportunities do we have to meditate on spiritual things ?
Do you at times take notes during public talks , assemblies , and conventions ?
magazines and the latest convention releases give us fresh information that we can read and digest .
When you read the Yearbook , you may find it helpful to pause before moving from one experience to another .
That will give you time to reflect on what you read and to let the experience touch your heart .
What should be the primary focus of our meditation , and why ?
Meditating on spiritual things will help a person grow to Christian maturity .
Therefore , let us continue to ponder over God’s Word .
15 , 16 . ( a ) How do we personally benefit from pondering over spiritual matters ?
By continuing to ponder over spiritual things , we will maintain our enthusiasm for the truth .
Meditating deeply on God’s greatest gift , the ransom sacrifice of Jesus , will help us to cherish the privilege of having a close relationship with our Holy Father , Jehovah .
Indeed , wonderful benefits come to all who are “ examining the Scriptures daily ” and meditating on what they learn . ​ — Acts 17 : 11 .
How do you find the time to meditate ?
At the time that my condition became apparent , my parents encouraged me to work hard so that I would not constantly think about my appearance .
That attracted many customers .
I was still very short , and I had to struggle with even simple things in life , such as the height of store counters .
Everything seemed to be designed for people almost twice my height .
I felt sorry for myself , but that changed when I was 14 years old .
I reacted by staying indoors for weeks at a time .
The sandy roads in our neighborhood were always slippery , and in the rainy season , muddy .
How do I support myself ?
Sadly , in 2004 , pain caused by my deformed spinal column had increased to the point that it was only reasonable for me to stop pioneering .
I have every reason to be happy because drawing near to God has been good for me . ​ — As told by Sarah Maiga .

Should he turn and wave ​ — one last time ?
What led the young man to pursue such a course of life ?
The people may have understood the Greek language , but they still spoke the local tongue , Lycaonian .
So Paul performed a miracle and healed the man ! ​ — Acts 14 : 5 - 10 .
Why , from boyhood Timothy had probably seen that man countless times on the streets of Lystra .
How relieved they must have been when he stirred , got up , and then courageously went right back into Lystra !
After making new disciples there as well , they again braved danger and returned to Lystra .
“ They strengthened the disciples , ” the account tells us , “ encouraging them to remain in the faith . ”
Timothy had seen Paul live up to those words , facing tribulation bravely in order to share the good news with others .
Wisely , they seek out friends with strong faith , who will encourage and strengthen them .
And they do not let opposition turn them away from serving the true God !
Picture the excitement in Timothy’s household when Paul arrived , this time accompanied by Silas .
“ The holy writings ” that Timothy had been taught “ from infancy ” by his mother and grandmother included sound , practical counsel for young people .
Here is one example : “ Remember , then , your Grand Creator in the days of your youth . ”
He saw that the best way for him to remember his Grand Creator included sharing the good news about God’s Son , the Christ .
Timothy gradually learned to overcome any natural shyness that held him back and to be bold in telling others the good news about Jesus Christ .
No doubt they were touched to see how the youth built up and encouraged everyone around him .
God inspired some prophecies to be made about him ​ — perhaps relating to the kind of service he would one day render to many congregations .
They laid their hands on the young man , a gesture that signified that he was appointed to a special post of service to Jehovah God . ​ — 1 Timothy 1 : 18 ; 4 : 14 .
After visiting the congregations in Galatia , the missionaries left the broad , paved Roman roads and walked hundreds of miles across the vast tablelands of Phrygia , heading north and then west .
Paul was able to leave Timothy in Beroea with Silas .
Timothy earned it through hard work , humble service , and faithful endurance under difficult challenges .
Paul entrusted him with the responsibility not only to visit congregations to strengthen and encourage them but also to appoint men who qualified to serve as congregation elders and ministerial servants . ​ — 1 Timothy 5 : 22 .
He sent one final inspired letter to Timothy .
in this issue .
By this time , Joseph had been imprisoned for a number of years .
That the writer mentions this seemingly insignificant detail at all shows that he was familiar with Egyptian customs .
Not necessarily .
Whom did the ancients consider to be Greek ?
He noted that as a result , “ those are called Greeks that have had the advantage of our education , rather than the natives of Greece . ”

▪ One Hundred Years Under Kingdom Rulership !
COVER : A circuit overseer and some special pioneers travel by boat in the Amazon rain forest .
PUBLISHERS
PIONEERS
What has the Messianic Kingdom been doing that convinces you that it is God’s loving arrangement for mankind ?
What is God’s dominant quality , and how does knowing this make you feel about him ?
Of what does God’s love assure us ?
Imagine what life would be like if God did not have love for mankind .
When rebelling against Jehovah’s rule , the Devil influenced the first human pair to do the same .
In effect , Satan claimed that his rule would be better than that of the Creator .
In his great wisdom , Jehovah has allowed enough time to pass to expose very clearly the inadequacy of any rule other than his .
Today , world conditions keep getting worse .
After Jehovah destroys wickedness and those who cause it , if anyone ever again would challenge Jehovah’s way of ruling in love , there would be no need for God to permit the challenge to stand .
Yes , God’s “ invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward , because they are perceived by the things made , even his eternal power and Godship . ” ​ — Rom .
( Read Revelation 4 : 11 . )
You hate all those who behave wickedly . ”
This will come to pass because our loving God always does what is in the best interests of his faithful servants .
The Bible tells us : “ He will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore .
( Read John 17 : 3 . )
God lovingly sent his willing Son to earth ( See paragraph 13 )
14 , 15 .
God’s love for humans is so great that he does not withhold good from them regardless of the cost to himself .
At their resurrection , Jesus ’ 144,000 heavenly joint heirs take with them the experience of human life .
Let your Kingdom come .
Contrast the rulership of Jesus with that of sinful human rulers .
What a contrast there is between Jesus ’ loving heavenly kingship and the rulership by humans who have led many millions of people to their death in warfare !
Bible prophecy shows that God’s heavenly Kingdom was established when Christ’s presence began in 1914 .
Why should Jehovah’s servants reflect his love ?
Notice that Jesus placed love of neighbor second only to love of Jehovah .
But who is our “ neighbor ” ?
He purposed for them to have a happy , enduring union and to fill the earth with their offspring .
However , rebellion against Jehovah’s sovereignty marred the first marriage and brought sin and death to all mankind .
6 , 7 . ( a ) What does the Bible say about headship ?
But headship is not to be exercised in a domineering way .
For example , Jehovah exercises his headship over Christ in a kind , unselfish way , and Jesus responds to it .
God’s Word answers : “ Let us work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith . ”
12 , 13 .
7 : 9 , 14 , 15 .
When the last days began in 1914 , there were only a few thousand servants of Jehovah worldwide .
As a result , today a great crowd with an earthly hope is being gathered .
The scope of the preaching work is remarkable .
The Watchtower is the most widely distributed magazine in the world .
4 : 4 .
17 , 18 .
We show love of neighbor even if our message is rejected by an angry householder who berates us .
In his Sermon on the Mount , he declared : “ You heard that it was said : ‘ You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
Why will love of God and neighbor permeate the new world ?
For instance , even if some do not respond favorably to the Kingdom message , we show neighbor love when they are in need .
The Kingdom was truly dear to his heart . ​ — Read Matthew 12 : 34 .
How many may have been present when the commission at Matthew 28 : 19 , 20 was given , and why can we draw that conclusion ?
Why have we used a variety of tools in our preaching work ?
A gardener may use a variety of tools to prepare his garden to receive seed .
What was a testimony card , and how was it used ?
Still others , thinking that the card was theirs to keep , accepted it from the publisher and closed the door .
Another tool that was used in the 1930 ’ s and early 1940 ’ s was the portable phonograph , which some brothers nicknamed Aaron because the machine did most of the talking for them .
On hearing one of the recorded Bible talks , a householder named Hillary Goslin obtained the publisher’s permission to borrow the phonograph for a week in order to acquaint his neighbors with the Kingdom message .
( Read Matthew 9 : 37 . )
Engaging in a new feature of the work , perhaps one outside our comfort zone , helps us to build trust and faith in Jehovah , leading to greater spirituality . ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 12 : 9 , 10 .
Publishers needed to know how to overcome objections tactfully and how to teach honesthearted ones skillfully .
Doubtless moved by God’s spirit , Nathan H .
( b ) How has Jehovah’s promise recorded at Psalm 32 : 8 proved true in your case ?
Children too joined the school , although it was not necessarily easy for some to present a talk to the congregation .
Angelo Manera , mentioned earlier , remembered a first student talk given by a young lad who had just started public school . “ He was so nervous that when he started his talk , he began to sob .
Ask Jehovah to help you overcome your fears .
What purpose has been served by Gilead School ( a ) in the past and ( b ) since 2011 ?
Gilead was inaugurated in 1943 , and since then over 8,500 have been trained .
Name some of the other schools that have helped qualified Witnesses to grow spiritually .
Without a doubt , the King is continuing to train his subjects !
What perceptive comment did Charles Taze Russell make about the preaching work , and how has this proved to be true ?
Our King , Jesus Christ , continues to train us .
H .
There is reason to believe that most of those present on that occasion became Christians .
Significantly , he adds : “ Most of [ them ] are still with us , though some have fallen asleep in death . ”
THE man’s wife could hardly have brought him more surprising news .
Let us consider each of these qualities , one at a time .
How did Jesus express love for his disciples ?
Jesus did not hesitate to tell his disciples that he loved them .
How can you imitate Jesus ’ way of teaching ?
Help your children to feel that way by often telling them “ I love you . ”
When that happens , imitate Jesus .
“ If they warned me about the consequences of misbehaving , they would always follow through .
Her husband , Pranas , adds : “ Later , our children were keen to be involved at assemblies and on theocratic projects .
When a crowd came to see Jesus , how did he show insight ?
On one occasion , some of his listeners in Galilee appeared eager to follow him .
( b ) How did Jesus ’ warning prove to be timely ?
Ask yourself : ‘ What may tempt my child to look at pornography ?
You can succeed in doing so with love , humility , and insight .
ON MOST Bible studies , we use the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
If possible , use the study guides on jw.org to help your young ones reason on the material in the Bible Teach book so that it reaches their heart . ​ — Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > TEENAGERS .
Parents may decide to have one parent study these books with a child apart from the regular Family Worship sessions .

“ Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men . ” ​ — LUKE 2 : 52 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What concerns do some parents have when their children become teenagers ?
You may understand Berenice’s concern if your child is a teenager or is approaching adolescence .
While acknowledging that adolescence can be challenging for parents and teenagers alike , one expert on child development states : “ Adolescence is not a period of being ‘ crazy ’ or ‘ immature . ’
Why could Jesus call his apostles his friends ?
Jesus was a loving and loyal friend .
He spent time with them , shared his feelings with them , and carefully listened when they poured out their hearts to him .
Therefore , he desired that they zealously participate in spiritual activities .
And he lovingly assured his disciples that he would help them to succeed . ​ — Matt .
28 : 19 , 20 .
You want your teenage children to remain spiritually healthy .
As Jesus helped his disciples , you seek to help your teenage children to succeed in the ministry by developing in them a love of teaching God’s Word and by helping them stick to a good field service routine .
If my spiritual routine gets disrupted now , I have a longing to return to it as quickly as possible .
I don’t think I would have developed that longing had our parents not been firm in maintaining a spiritual routine .
( b ) How did Jesus ’ humility affect his disciples ?
Not at all .
In fact , the more he relied on Jehovah , the more his disciples trusted him .
“ Giving reasons helps teenagers to trust you because they see that your decisions are not arbitrary or capricious but reasonable , ” says Barry , who raised four children .
Jesus , however , knew that Peter’s comment reflected faulty thinking .
To help him and the other disciples , Jesus gave frank counsel , stated the consequences of a self - sparing attitude , and outlined the blessings of a self - sacrificing spirit .
13 , 14 . ( a ) What may indicate that your teen’s faith is wavering ?
They hugged me , told me that they understood , and promised to help me . ”
For instance , when a man named Nathanael heard that Jesus had come from Nazareth , he said : “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ”
Critical ?
Prejudiced ?
In thought or word , never label your son or daughter a “ rebellious teenager ” or a “ problem child . ”
Keep working tirelessly to train your children to serve Jehovah .
The Israelites attacked in the spring of the year , just after harvesttime when grain supplies were abundant .

Foreign colporteurs relied on testimony cards to speak for them about the Kingdom hope .
Early colporteurs used bicycles and motorcycles to spread the good news in France
When preaching in apartment buildings , colporteurs were often chased away by caretakers .
A good sense of humor greatly helped these zealous colporteurs !
In the early 1930 ’ s , the number of Kingdom publishers in France did not exceed 700 , and most of them were scattered throughout the country .
5 : 11 .
Those self - sacrificing colporteurs maintained a positive outlook despite obstacles .
Those early pioneers indeed left a legacy of endurance and zeal for consideration by others who want to expand their ministry .
Today , there are some 14,000 regular pioneers in France .
65 : 12 , 13 ; 147 : 7 , 8 ; 148 : 3 , 4 .
He also provides sound reasons for us to be generous .
When Paul wrote his second inspired letter to the congregation in Corinth , he emphasized the proper attitude to have toward giving .

Jehovah’s gift evidently includes the sum total of all the goodness that God extends to his people through Jesus Christ .
How can we show appreciation for all that Jehovah and his Son have done and will yet do for us ?

The original text of the Bible was written on perishable materials , such as leather and papyrus .
Such copies were expensive , and few people could afford them .
But with the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press over 550 years ago , circulation of the Bible greatly accelerated .

She even went from house to house to raise funds for the party .
Sadly , however , he has vivid memories of the hypocrisy of the priests who drank heavily , gambled , and stole from the collection plate , all the while preaching to him about burning in hell if he sinned .
Jeffery spent most of his working life in marketing and sales for international ship owners based in the United Kingdom and the United States .
Regrettably , these are not isolated cases .
According to the Bible , hypocrisy got its start , not among humans , but with an unseen spirit creature .
When the ancient nation of Israel fell into the trap of false worship and spiritual hypocrisy , God repeatedly warned them of the consequences .
When the nation failed to turn around , God allowed foreign powers to destroy Israel’s religious center ​ — Jerusalem and its temple — ​ first by the Babylonians in 607 B.C.E . and ultimately by the Roman armies in 70 C.E .
On the other hand , God and His Son , Jesus , greatly value humans who are honest and sincere .
For example , early in Jesus ’ ministry , a man named Nathanael approached him .
Jesus told his audience : “ Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them . . . as the hypocrites do . ”
For , in reality , “ all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ” ​ — Romans 3 : 23 .
On one occasion , disciples of the Pharisees and party followers of Herod approached Jesus with a tax question .
When the Christian congregation was established at Pentecost 33 C.E . , an environment was created in which truth and honesty flourished .
True Christians worked hard to eradicate hypocritical tendencies from their personality .
The teachings of Jesus and the apostles , as found in the Bible , are just as powerful today as they were in the first century .
“ I saw real love and genuine interest for fellow man being displayed . ” ​ — PANAYIOTA
She did not see any outward display of righteousness to impress others .
Happily , after a period of readjustment , Daniel felt he could resume his privileges of service with a good conscience , and he gladly accepted responsibilities in the congregation once again .
Jeffery , who spent his life in the business world , said : “ As I progressed in Bible knowledge , I realized that I could no longer be the slick , fast - talking salesman who was prepared to say anything to get the contract .

It also encourages us to imitate Jesus ’ example in using this powerful gift to honor God and benefit others .

“ Please listen , and I will speak . ” ​ — JOB 42 : 4 .
SONGS : 113 , 114
Why does God simplify how he expresses his thoughts to humans ?
Why has the use of different human languages not hindered God’s communication with man ?
Jehovah has intimate knowledge of billions of intelligent creatures , earthly and heavenly .
Jehovah communicated with Adam in the garden of Eden , using human language .
All this information is of great value today . ​ — Rom .
Explain .
The Scriptures are silent about whether Jesus also spoke those languages .
8 , 9 .
( Read Acts 6 : 1 . )
As Christianity spread , much communication among Christians was in Greek .
In fact , the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , which contain inspired records of what Jesus taught and did , were widely distributed in Greek .
Jehovah directed the inspiration of the Bible , but he allowed it to be presented in different styles .
Has God’s communication with humans been hindered by the use of different languages and minor variations in translation ?
Later , Bible manuscripts were copied again and again by Jews and Christians , preserving the holy writings . These were translated into many more languages .
John Chrysostom of the fourth / ​ fifth century C.E . said that by his day , Jesus ’ teachings had been translated into the languages of the Syrians , Egyptians , Indians , Persians , Ethiopians , and innumerable other peoples .
How was the transmission of the Bible opposed ?
Despite a campaign by the clergy to burn publicly all the Bibles that they could find , copies began to circulate in great numbers .
( a ) How have present - day language barriers been overcome ?
There was a need for a Bible that would accurately convey in modern speech the intent of the original writings .
When releasing the first volume on August 2 , 1950 , Brother N .
Knorr told a convention audience : “ More and more the need has been felt for a translation in modern speech , in harmony with revealed truth , and yet furnishing us the basis for gaining further truth by faithfully presenting the sense of the original writings ; a translation just as understandable to modern readers as the original writings of Christ’s disciples were understandable to the simple , plain , common , lowly readers of their day . ”
That hope was realized in a significant way by 1963 when the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures was produced in six more languages ​ — Dutch , French , German , Italian , Portuguese , and Spanish .
Septuagint means “ Seventy . ”
Translation reportedly began in Egypt in the third century B.C.E . and may have been finished by 150 B.C.E .
SONGS : 37 , 116
Why was the New World Translation revised ?
( b ) How have God’s people used their language abilities since then ?
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
In the 1940 ’ s , the New World Bible Translation Committee established principles of translation that have been followed in over 130 languages .
That version omitted the name , reversing the policy of the editors of the American Standard Version of 1901 .

( Read Ezekiel 38 : 23 . )
These were restored primarily because the Dead Sea Scrolls , which predate the Hebrew Masoretic text by over 1,000 years , contain the name in these verses .
The appendix of the 2013 revision of the New World Translation contains updated information on this matter .
And the New World Bible Translation Committee would never undermine the name’s significance by omitting it from the Bible .
( Read Malachi 3 : 16 . )
Because the equivalent terms could give the impression that the “ soul ” is an immaterial part of man .
That could reflect the mistaken view that it is something like a ghost and not man himself .
Questions from translators raised awareness that similar misunderstandings were possible .
Thousands of questions from Bible translators were reviewed during the revision process .
Obsolete English expressions were replaced , and a concerted effort was put forth to make the text clear and easy to understand without sacrificing accuracy .
What has been the effect of this revised English New World Translation ?
14 , 15 .
What a privilege to have Jehovah speak to us in our own language ! ”
A report from Rwanda stated : “ For a long time , many people with whom the brothers were studying had not progressed because they had no Bibles .
They could not afford to purchase the local church edition .
A Rwandan family with four teenagers said : “ We really thank Jehovah and the faithful and discreet slave for giving us this Bible .
To show our gratitude to Jehovah , we read the Bible as a family every day . ”
( b ) What should be our determination ?
Satan tries to block such efforts , but we trust that Jehovah wants to have all his people listen as he speaks to them in clear , understandable language .
Some reference works present this understanding , though not all scholars agree .

For example , there are now about 10 percent fewer English words in the translation .
That captures the meaning of a Bible term often used in parallel with “ faithfulness . ” ​ — Ps .
The Hebrew and Greek terms translated “ seed ” appear often in the Scriptures , both in an agricultural sense and with the figurative meaning of “ offspring . ”
Past editions of the New World Translation consistently used “ seed , ” including at Genesis 3 : 15 .
57 : 3 .
6 : 12 .
Why are the expressions “ sons of Israel ” and “ fatherless boys ” now translated “ Israelites ” and “ fatherless children ” ?
The two main Hebrew verb states are the imperfect , denoting continuous action , and the perfect , denoting completed action .
However , Jehovah evidently called to Adam repeatedly , so this is still highlighted at Genesis 3 : 9 with the rendering “ kept calling . ”
Rhythm is achieved in Hebrew poetry , not by rhyming words , but by the logical order of the thoughts .
Previous editions of the New World Translation formatted Job and Psalms in verse format to show that they were originally meant to be sung or recited .
An example of this is Isaiah 24 : 2 , where each line contains a contrast , and one line builds on another to emphasize that no one would be excluded from God’s judgment .
Recognizing such passages as poetry shows the reader that the Bible writer was not simply repeating himself ; rather , he was using a poetic technique to emphasize God’s message .
The distinction between Hebrew prose and poetry may not always be clearly evident , so there are differences among Bible translations as to which passages are poetic .
For example , at 2 Samuel 13 : 21 , the Greek Septuagint contains the equivalent of the words : “ But he would not hurt the feelings of Amnon his son , because he loved him , for he was his firstborn . ”
A short dictionary that explains words and expressions used in the Bible
choose the right time to speak ?
be gracious in our speech ?
IN EARLY October 1871 , what has been described as the most deadly forest fire in U.S . history engulfed the dry woodlands of northeastern Wisconsin .
The point of James ’ illustration is made clear in verse 6 .
The Bible even says that “ death and life are in the power of the tongue . ”
19 : 14 .
4 : 4 .
How can we show appreciation for God’s gift of speech ?
Rather , you would show your appreciation by putting it to good use .
We show our gratitude for Jehovah’s gift of speech by using it wisely .
How does the Bible illustrate the importance of choosing the right time to speak ?
Placing them against the background of silver carvings would enhance their beauty .
Similarly , carefully picking a suitable time to speak can make our speech more appealing and effective .
How ?
Although Jehovah’s Witnesses in the area suffered along with their neighbors , they took advantage of every opportunity to use the Bible to comfort those who were mourning .
Our brothers discerned that immediately following the tsunami was not necessarily the best time to tell the grief - stricken victims about the resurrection hope .
Words have the power to hurt as well as to heal .
( Read Proverbs 12 : 18 . )
Using words to inflict pain is common in Satan’s world .
4 : 29 , 31 .
If our hearts are full of love and compassion , our speech will likely be positive and upbuilding .
How can we enhance our ability to select the right words ?
Regarding the relationship between Jehovah and his firstborn Son , we read : “ Jehovah has given me [ Jesus ] the tongue of those taught , so that I may know how to answer the tired one with the right word . ”
Trumpets were used in Israel to assemble the camp and to disperse it , as well as to spur the army to do battle .
Jesus set the finest example of appropriate word selection . Consider his short yet powerful discourse recorded in Matthew chapters 5 through 7 .
Instead , he chose clear , simple expressions to reach the hearts of his listeners .
In fact , graciousness can make our speech more persuasive .
2 : 23 .
Elders can imitate Jesus ’ example by giving counsel “ in a spirit of mildness . ” ​ — Gal .
In time , he got baptized , and he later served at Bethel .
May we follow Jesus ’ example by choosing the right time , striving to select the proper words , and putting forth effort to be gracious .
WHAT : Select the proper words
“ Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed . ” ​ — PS .
What may we at times wonder , and what examples in the Bible come to mind ?
Similar concern was expressed by two kings in the days of the prophets Elijah and Elisha .
King Ahaziah , son of Ahab and Jezebel , had a bad fall , so he asked : ‘ Will I recover from this injury ? ’
1 : 2 ; 8 : 7 , 8 .
By means of his prophets , Jehovah even performed resurrections .
At times , he punished individuals with sickness , such as the Pharaoh in Abraham’s day and later Moses ’ sister , Miriam .
Then “ no resident will say : ‘ I am sick . ’ ” ​ — Isa .
How should we view grave illnesses or infirmities , and what should we do about them ?

But those and other gifts , such as speaking in tongues and prophesying , would soon come to an end .
King David wrote : “ Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one ; Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity .
Yes , an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course .
According to Psalm 41 : 4 , what did David seek from Jehovah ?
Still , the king was sure that God would sustain him on his sickbed .
( a ) How did David’s case differ from that of King Hezekiah ?
In that unusual case , God intervened .
Because David’s sin had been forgiven , he could ask that God would comfort and support him and that the physical resources of his body might enable him to recover .
He did so for “ the father of Publius [ who ] was lying in bed sick with fever and dysentery . ”
Paul “ prayed , laid his hands on him , and healed him . ”
The Bible does not indicate where or when Luke received his medical training .
We do not live at a time when a fellow Christian can use “ gifts of healing ” to cure us .
Paul did so when Timothy was experiencing stomach problems , perhaps because the local water was polluted .
Each person has the right to choose which to accept or employ .
Other individuals or companies stress the use of products that are high - priced in order to make large profits .
The final words , a type of complimentary close , can also be rendered “ be strong . ”
Rather , it points to Jehovah’s provision through Jesus for giving everlasting life to obedient mankind ​ — truly something we can look forward to . ​ — Isa .
41 : 12 .
LIFE STORY
“ AND just why won’t you worship your ancestors ? ” my mother asked .
It was not like Mom to speak this way .
But just two months of study with Jehovah’s Witnesses convinced me that the Bible is true .
As my knowledge of the truth increased , I told Mom that I would no longer share in Buddhist rites . Suddenly , her attitude changed .
Never had I imagined that my mother would say this !
Dad took Mom’s side .
So I agreed to do as they said for three months , but I promised Jehovah that I would attend the meetings again when that time was up .
First , I thought that my feelings would not change in three months ’ time .
In the family , opposition took many forms .

So I waited until I was 20 years old .
Then , to ease Mom’s mind , I asked the branch office for an assignment in southern Japan , where we had relatives .
Meanwhile , I studied English with a view to expanding my service .
After seven years , I received a letter from Atsushi , one of the special pioneer brothers mentioned earlier .
I had never had romantic feelings for Atsushi , nor did I think that he had any toward me .
In time , we got married . How happy I was to have Mom , Dad , and several relatives attend our wedding !
After we had served all the congregations in the circuit one time , we received a telephone call from the branch office . The question ? ‘ Would we accept an assignment to circuit work in Nepal ? ’
So I telephoned them .

Each country has its unique background and culture .
I am deeply grateful that I found peace with God and with my mother .

Hitoshi’s family and friends encouraged him to remain firm in his resolve to be honest , yet he began to have some doubts .
In fact , some may even view it as a liability , particularly in the business community .

And more important , how can we avoid getting caught up in these dishonest practices ?
When the truth comes to light , however , dishonesty often brings negative consequences .
Trust can be shattered , however , by just one act of dishonesty .
And when trust has been broken , it can be very difficult to rebuild .

WHAT IS IT ?
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS : “ You must not defraud a hired worker who is in need and poor . ”
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS : “ Let the one who steals steal no more ; rather , let him do hard work , doing good work with his hands , so that he may have something to share with someone in need . ”
“ Do not be misled . . . . Thieves , greedy people , drunkards , revilers , and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 , 10 .
Christians take seriously the apostle Paul’s inspired words : “ We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ”
What does that involve ?
Most people glance at themselves in a mirror every morning before going out in public .
Why ?
Because they want to look their best .
Indeed , the person we are on the inside can either add to or detract from our outward appearance .
The book The ( Honest ) Truth About Dishonesty put it this way : “ Essentially , we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self - image as reasonably honest individuals . ”
It has stood the test of time .
After all , we live in a morally depraved world that pressures us to accept its corrupt standards .
Later , I married , and my husband and I began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .

“ My supervisor at work encouraged me to lie about some missing supplies at work , but I refused .
Being honest in a dishonest world calls for courage .
A clean conscience , peace of mind , and self - respect ​ — such rewards show that it really does pay to be honest . Do you not agree ?

What Does the Bible Say ?
COVER SUBJECT
Perhaps you have wondered : ‘ How long does it take to get over grief ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’

“ There is no such thing as ‘ getting over ’ grief , ” writes Dr .
Alan Wolfelt in his book Healing a Spouse’s Grieving Heart .
The expression “ began to ” suggests that it took some time for him to cope with his loss .
Six years later the pain in my heart is still there .
Clearly , such painful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
How can we cope with grief ?
As we note in the “ Imitate Their Faith ” article in this issue , Isaac was still grieving over the loss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 67 .
Not all of it , however , is helpful .
Others may push you to do the opposite and expose all your feelings .
Mental - health experts acknowledge that tearfulness is a normal part of grieving .
The Bible lends no support to the notion that it is wrong or unmanly to shed tears of grief .
There are many reasons why a bereaved person may feel angry , such as when thoughtless and unfounded comments are made by a respected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a South African man named Mike .
Or maybe your last encounter with the deceased involved an argument . This may add to your feeling of guilt .
The Bible reminds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best Friend a bereaved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
Make a list of comforting scriptures .
( See accompanying box . )
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
God promises to resurrect the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Thankfully , she received ongoing support from loyal friends .
“ To be honest , ” says Kaori , “ I wasn’t happy about that .
I didn’t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I didn’t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way Mama Ritsuko treated me , I came to feel close to her .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her upbuilding association . ”
“ I lost my loyal husband with whom I had spent 33 years of marriage , ” says Poli .
After the funeral , Poli moved to Canada with her youngest son , 15 - year - old Daniel .
Both mother and son are doing well today .
You may recall that Gail , mentioned earlier in this series , doubts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Rob .
You will call , and I will answer you . You will long for the work of your hands . ”
Job was confident that his God would miss him and would long to restore him to life .
Matthew’s account reads : “ Jacob became father to Joseph , ” employing a Greek term indicating clearly that Jacob was Joseph’s natural father .
Joseph was in the same sense “ son ” of Heli , as he married Heli’s daughter Mary .

IMITATE THEIR FAITH | REBEKAH
After weeks of travel , she was finally getting used to the swaying gait of the camel as she sat perched high atop its back .
Her childhood home in Haran was far behind her , hundreds of miles to the northeast .
She might never see her family again .
Questions about her future surely flooded her mind ​ — especially now as she neared her journey’s end .
There are other beautiful and rare qualities associated with Rebekah’s faith .
Rebekah grew up to be a very beautiful young woman , but she was no passive , vain beauty .
It was such a modest request and so politely made !
She could see that his kind eyes were watching her attentively , and she wanted to be as generous as she could .
* But did Rebekah know that when she made her offer ?
Then he asked : “ Please tell me , whose daughter are you ?
He was a servant of Abraham , the brother of Rebekah’s grandfather .
This servant’s name was probably Eliezer .
Imagine Eliezer telling his story as Rebekah’s father , Bethuel , as well as her brother Laban , listened with rapt attention .
Eliezer went on to tell his hosts that when he arrived at the well near Haran , he prayed to Jehovah God . He asked Jehovah , in effect , to choose the young woman for Isaac to marry .
And who had come along and done precisely that ?
As was the custom , they concluded a marriage covenant , betrothing Rebekah to Isaac .
What would she say ?
When she answered , she revealed how she felt about this sudden , perhaps daunting , change in her life .
What a remarkable spirit she had !
Today , our customs regarding marriage may be quite different , but we can still learn much from Rebekah .
Rebekah had seen camels aplenty in her life , but we cannot assume that she was an experienced camel rider .
Novice camel riders often complain of discomfort ​ — even after a very short ride !
Picture the old man talking to her by an evening campfire , telling her of Jehovah’s promise to His friend Abraham .
As the caravan traversed the Negeb and twilight began to fall over the land , Rebekah saw a man out walking in the fields .
He looked thoughtful , contemplative .
That kind of submission may strike some today as old - fashioned .
Really , though , men as well as women may take a lesson from Rebekah’s humility , for who of us does not need more of that lovely quality ?
Even for us , some 39 centuries later , it is easy to love Rebekah .
How can we help but admire her courage , her industriousness , her hospitality , and her humility ?
Eliezer is not named in this account , but he was likely the servant involved .
“ You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way . ”

OTHER BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED
This issue of The Watchtower discusses how God will fulfill that promise and what it can mean for you .
It adheres to the Bible as its authority .

COVER SUBJECT | WHY DID JESUS SUFFER AND DIE ?
He died in excruciating pain .
* His manner of death , as described in the Gospels , agrees with Roman executional methods of the time .
All these factors strongly indicate that the Gospel writers were honest and accurate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is generally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
All doubt was removed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrected Jesus on separate occasions .
Regarding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest , not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . ”
Why not to all the people ?
Matthew’s Gospel tells us that when the religious enemies heard reports of Jesus ’ resurrection , they schemed to suppress them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
In spite of the trials and hardships we face , our normal and natural desire is to live .
So , what went wrong ?
The Bible’s answers are heartening , and they have a direct bearing on why Jesus suffered and died .
But Genesis , like the Gospels , gives every indication of being a factual , historical record .
This explanation of why we die is in harmony with what we know today about heredity .
But has God done anything to remedy the situation ?
But we were born in this sinful condition through no fault of our own .
Jesus ’ death opens the way to a happy , endless life
Could he be trusted to keep his promises ?
God’s adherence to justice in working out our salvation is assurance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrificial death , God opened the way to endless life in Paradise on earth .
Jesus ’ death is thus an expression not only of God’s unfailing justice but , more specially , of his great love for humans .
By enduring under trial , Jesus left us a model to follow .
The way to unending life is open .
Do you want to live forever ?

The Bible speaks of an approaching disaster , a “ great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now , no , nor will occur again . ”
But this is not the end of planet Earth by irresponsible human activities or some catastrophic natural event ​ — for it is God’s purpose that the earth remain forever .
“ God is love , ” says the Bible , and God , whose name is Jehovah , promises that “ the righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Nonetheless , Jesus encouraged us to “ keep on the watch . ”
Following the 2004 tsunami , a warning system was installed in the affected region in an effort to prevent similar loss of life from occurring in the future .
The Bible foretold : “ This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations , and then the end will come . ” ​ — Matthew 24 : 14 .

What is dedication , and how is it related to baptism ?
“ I HAVE known you since you were born , ” said a Christian elder to 12 - year - old Christopher , “ and I’m happy to hear that you want to get baptized .
Therefore , Christian parents take time to teach their children what is involved in being a disciple of Christ .
If so , you are to be commended !
We read at Proverbs 20 : 11 : “ Even a child is known by his actions , whether his behavior is pure and right . ”
Thus , baptism is an important and appropriate step for a young person who has manifested considerable maturity and has made a dedication to Jehovah . ​ — Prov . 20 : 7 .
He may have been in his early teens when he was forcibly taken from his parents into exile in Babylon .

“ Why Live by Bible Standards ? ” ​ — chap . 34
This was the year that God’s people started to return to their God - given spiritual estate .
But when did that captivity actually begin ?
Eventually , “ breath came into them , and they began to live . ”
37 : 7 - 10 , 14 .
Some of them endeavored to produce Bibles in the languages of the common people .
Given these facts , it becomes clear that God’s people went into captivity to Babylon the Great with the growth of the apostasy in the second century C.E .
This was a dark period of time , similar to what the ancient Israelites experienced while in exile .
Put simply , we cannot be certain whether Jesus actually stood in the temple or he did so only by means of a vision .
Consider first what the Bible record says . In his Gospel account of this event , the apostle Matthew was inspired to write : “ Then the Devil took him [ Jesus ] along into the holy city , and he stationed him on the battlement [ “ parapet ; highest point , ” ftn . ] of the temple . ”
For example , in the issue of March 1 , 1961 , The Watchtower explained : “ It does not seem reasonable to place a literal construction on all that appears in the account of Jesus ’ temptation in the wilderness .
Such was not at all necessary for the temptation to have force . ”
How did Jesus get from the wilderness to Jerusalem ?
The ancient historian Josephus stated that if a person stood there and looked down , he “ would become dizzy ” because of the height .
What , though , of the temptation wherein Jesus was shown “ all the kingdoms of the world ” ?
So Satan may have used some sort of vision to show these to Jesus , similar to the way a projector and a screen can be used to show someone pictures of various places on earth .
The fact is , as stated at the outset , we cannot be dogmatic about this matter .
But one thing we can be sure about is that these temptations were real and that Jesus gave a conclusive answer to the Devil in each case .
Ezekiel 37 : 1 - 14 and Revelation 11 : 7 - 12 each speak of a spiritual restoration that took place in 1919 .
On the other hand , the prophecy in Revelation refers to the spiritual rebirth of a small group of anointed brothers who have taken the lead after a relatively short period of forced inactivity .

From the beginning , what has characterized God’s works ?
As wisdom personified , God’s first creation said : “ I was beside [ Jehovah ] as a master worker .
Cooperation continued to mark God’s works .

This pattern of working together characterized the early Christian congregation under its head , Jesus Christ .
Toward the end of the first century C.E . , the apostle John received a vision of seven angels , each of whom sounded a trumpet blast .
The “ star ” had a key in his hand with which he opened the shaft of an abyss .
What work do God’s people have to do , and what is the only way that they can do this ?
How are we united as we preach the good news ?
The guidance given through congregations around the globe prepares us for a united effort .
The commemoration of Jesus ’ death also unites us .
In the weeks before the Memorial , we cover as much of our congregation’s territory as possible , inviting others to join us for that important occasion .
A solitary locust does not have a great impact .
( Read Ephesians 4 : 15 , 16 . )
A key is to submit ourselves to and respect those whom Jesus has designated to provide direction in the congregation , the elders .
What may younger ones do to help their congregation be united ?
And it is not hard to see that when members of a family share comments about God’s Word , they are drawn closer together ​ — all love the same God and all are interested in doing his will .
We should make it a point to do the same . That will unite us with our mate and draw us closer to our heavenly Father . ​ — Read Ecclesiastes 4 : 12 .
That involves cooperating to the greatest extent possible without compromising .
When the children became adults and left home , Mary felt very much alone .
Then David began to read the magazines that she left out for him .
How can older married ones help younger ones ?
Older ones can even assist younger members of the congregation in this regard .

So that vehicles on the road would not be crossing railroad tracks at the wrong moment and be struck by a speeding train .
9 : 5 , 6 .
Let us look at a few examples of how God continued to provide guidance through the centuries .
When God’s people escaped the tyranny of Egypt , new directions were needed .
God’s people would be living , not as a captive group of people , but as a freed nation solely under Jehovah’s Law .
The Law made it clear as never before that the Israelites were imperfect .
Furthermore , the Law helped to preserve the genealogical line leading to the Messiah and to identify him when he appeared . Yes , the Law acted as a temporary tutor , or “ guardian , ” leading to Christ . ​ — Gal .
We can stop and look at the underlying principles of the Law .
What new circumstances made new direction from God necessary ?
In 33 C.E . , Jehovah switched his favor from the congregation of natural Israel to the Christian congregation .
For spiritual Israel , “ the law of the Christ ” was mainly based on principles inscribed on hearts .
“ The law of the Christ ” would apply to and benefit Christians wherever they lived . ​ — Gal .
Just prior to the establishment of the new covenant , Jesus gave two significant commands .
Consider the preaching of the good news that Jesus would have his followers do .
The method and the scope of the preaching work were new .
That commandment involves a call not just to love one another in normal aspects of everyday life but to be willing even to surrender our life in behalf of our brother .
Especially since the appointment of “ the faithful and discreet slave , ” Jesus has provided his people with spiritual food at the proper time .
How should we respond to the guidance being given ?
Do you desire to do that ?
Indeed , to keep receiving God’s blessing , we need to pay attention to all the directions provided through the Christian congregation .
Having an obedient spirit now will help us to follow directions during the “ great tribulation , ” which will eliminate Satan’s entire evil system .
Likewise , the Bible informs us that scrolls will be opened to give us directions in new world living .
Following his example , true Christians would have understood that spreading “ the good news of the Kingdom of God ” would involve finding people who desired to know Bible truth .
We do not have any of the 12 apostles of Jesus with us on earth today , but many servants of Jehovah manifest a missionary spirit .
Others have moved to a different area of their native country .

For example , a missionary in a foreign land has to adapt to new circumstances .
What about us if we cannot move to where the need is greater ?
Should we conclude that we know everything about our congregation’s territory ? Or could we try to find innovative ways to reach people ?
Encourage others to “ do the work of an evangelizer ”
Having a positive attitude will help us to be zealous and enthusiastic for the ministry .
Thus they can be a blessing to many , such as when they take the lead in the field ministry .
True , there may be occasions when it would be particularly appropriate for one of those brothers to provide assistance .
For instance , when Salvatore experienced a financial crisis that made it necessary for him to sell his business , his home , and many of the family’s belongings , he wondered how his family could cope .
Despite the real anxiety that marked the earlier period , both families can now look back with happy memories on the time they spent together .
It comforts people with the good news that God’s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise .

What Does the Bible Say ?
“ We have only error - ridden copies , and the vast majority of these are centuries removed from the originals and different from them , evidently , in thousands of ways . ”
Does it matter whether or not the Bible has been changed ?
How did those manuscripts survive decay , opposition , and attempts to tamper with the text ?
THE THREAT : Papyrus and parchment were the primary writing materials used by Bible writers and copyists .
“ Jews were known to put scrolls containing Scripture in pitchers or jars in order to preserve them , ” says New Testament scholar Philip W .
THE RESULT : Thousands of portions of Bible manuscripts ​ — some over 2,000 years old — ​ survive to this day .
No other ancient text has so many manuscripts from so long ago . Papyrus is a writing material made from an aquatic plant of the same name .
Now , less than 250 years later , it has faded to the point of being barely legible .
Consider two examples :
His officials “ tore and burnt the rolls of the Law whenever they found them , ” wrote historian Heinrich Graetz , “ and killed those who were found to seek strength and consolation in their perusal . ”
Thereafter , the Bible was translated and produced at an unprecedented pace .
Yet , some copyists and translators have attempted to alter the Bible’s message .
Place of worship : Between the fourth and second centuries B.C.E . , the writers of the Samaritan Pentateuch inserted after Exodus 20 : 17 the words “ in Aargaareezem . And there you shall build an altar . ”
The Samaritans thus hoped to make the Scriptures support their construction of a temple on “ Aargaareezem , ” or Mount Gerizim .
Do older manuscripts prove that the Bible’s message has been preserved ?
A member of the editorial team of the Dead Sea Scrolls concluded that one scroll “ provides irrefutable proof that the transmission of the biblical text through a period of more than one thousand years by the hands of Jewish copyists has been extremely faithful and careful . ”
“ Although the Papyri supply a wealth of new information on textual detail , ” The Anchor Bible Dictionary observes , “ they also demonstrate remarkable stability in the transmission history of the biblical text . ”
“ It may be safely said that no other work of antiquity has been so accurately transmitted ”
“ No other ancient book has anything like such early and plentiful testimony to its text , ” wrote Sir Frederic Kenyon about the Christian Greek Scriptures , “ and no unbiased scholar would deny that the text that has come down to us is substantially sound . ”
What is so special about that book ?
Many students of the Bible have come to the same conclusion as the apostle Paul , who wrote : “ All Scripture is inspired of God . ”
They believe that the Bible has survived because it is the unique Word of God and because God has preserved it until today .
To limit the power of the Almighty ​ — who am I to do that ? ” ​ — Isaiah 40 : 8 .
But if a wind was blowing , no one was to come within 100 cubits , or about 150 feet ( 45 m ) .
Rather than chasing lepers away , he was willing to touch them ​ — and even heal them . ​ — Matthew 8 : 3 .

More than 100,000 people were murdered in Latin America in one year , and some 50,000 in Brazil alone .
Many causes have been identified , including the following : tension arising from social and economic inequalities , a general disdain for the lives of others , the abuse of alcohol and drugs , the exposure of children to the violent behavior of adults , and the fact that violent criminals act with seeming impunity .

Yes , and Alex deeply regrets all the bad things he did .
What made him change ?
César explains : “ For the first time , I found a purpose in life .
What do those experiences show us ?
These were things I never imagined I would be able to get rid of . ”
The Bible promises that God will soon cleanse this earth of violence .
How can we be sure that God wants to intervene and eradicate violence ?
The Creator loves peace and justice .
So your beliefs may be very different from those of other professed Christians .
There was no need for other names to identify them , since only one Christian faith existed .
There is only one way ​ — to use the Bible as a measuring stick .
Why , our very salvation is at stake !
We invite you to read the accompanying six questions and note the Bible’s answers to those questions .
This short quiz may help you to make the most useful comparison you could ever make .
1 QUESTION : Who is God ?
Jesus is subject to God and obedient to His will .
“ The Father is greater than I am . ” ​ — John 14 : 28 .
“ [ Jesus ] is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation . ” ​ — Colossians 1 : 15 .
People can be filled with holy spirit and empowered by it .
“ The seventh angel blew his trumpet . And there were loud voices in heaven , saying : ‘ The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ , and he will rule as king forever and ever . ’ ” ​ — Revelation 11 : 15 .

Is the Bible a Record of God’s Thoughts ?
THE BIBLE CHANGES LIVES
My father emigrated to Australia from Germany in 1949 .
However , my father had no tolerance for any religion .
She told us about a future paradise earth and how we could be happy if we followed the Bible’s standards of conduct . ​ — Psalm 37 : 10 , 29 ; Isaiah 48 : 17 .
At 18 years of age , I felt compelled to leave home because of Dad’s violence .
Our first daughter was born three years later , and I reconsidered what was important in my life .
One day , my workmates introduced me to pornography .
My behavior reflected what I was putting into my mind .
My speech was vulgar , and I had a filthy sense of humor .
I developed a warped view of sex .
I resumed my study of the Bible , although there had been a lapse of two decades .
One day I called a meeting with my work crew .
That passage says : “ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart , and do not rely on your own understanding . In all your ways take notice of him , and he will make your paths straight . ”
Our home is a haven of peace .

This article highlights what moved Jephthah and his daughter to live by divine principles despite challenging circumstances .
This article reviews four things that will help us to endure and three examples of steadfast endurance .
This article identifies four keys to maintaining our neutrality and avoiding compromise .
What challenge did Jephthah and his daughter face ?
THE anxious wait is over .
Her father’s heart swells with pride because he knows that his daughter’s willingness to support his decision brings Jehovah’s smile of approval .
( b ) According to Psalm 106 , what happened to the Israelites because of their disobedience ?
Every day , Jephthah and his daughter would have been reminded of the disastrous consequences of unfaithfulness to Jehovah .
Will we learn from the mistakes of the Israelites ?
( b ) How did Jephthah react ?
8 , 9 . ( a ) What principles in the Mosaic Law may have helped Jephthah ?
The Law also taught that a person must not ignore the needs of others , even of someone who “ hates ” him . ​ — Read Exodus 23 : 5 ; Leviticus 19 : 17 , 18 .
11 : 32 , 33 .

12 : 20 , 21 ; Col . 3 : 13 .
Under the Mosaic Law , a burnt offering was given entirely to Jehovah , so Jephthah evidently meant that he would devote the person to the exclusive service of God .
He had no other child ; his daughter was his only hope for a descendant , someone to carry on his name and his inheritance in Israel .
Would you have made the same choice ?
( See paragraphs 16 , 17 )
She sacrificed her natural desires for a husband and children in order to promote true worship .
( b ) How do the words at Hebrews 6 : 10 - 12 encourage you to be self - sacrificing ?
Although Jephthah’s life was full of challenges , he allowed Jehovah’s thinking to guide his choices in life .
Bitter disappointments caused by others failed to weaken his determination to remain faithful .
The Bible urges us to “ be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises . ”


Jesus warned that we who live in the last days would face severe trials and cruel mistreatment , but he also said that gaining the victory would depend on our endurance .
A person who endures manifests courage , steadfastness , and patience .
Endurance is “ the spirit which can bear things , not simply with resignation , but with blazing hope , ” says one reference work .
It is the virtue which can transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the goal . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 7 . )
7 : 28 .
Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 13 .
Nourish your faith with spiritual food .
To endure the ascent and reach their goal , climbers must consume as many calories as possible . Similarly , to endure in our Christian course and reach our goal , we must regularly take in as much spiritual food as possible .
When you struggle with adversity , therefore , imagine this invisible scene .
You can take personally Jehovah’s inspired request : “ Be wise , my son , and make my heart rejoice , so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me . ” ​ — Prov .

The darkness of Jesus ’ trials was temporary , but the brilliance of his heavenly reward would be everlasting .
The experiences of “ those who have endured ” teach us how to remain steadfast , reassure us that we can succeed , and remind us that our faithful course will be rewarded .
Let us consider a few examples .
Surely those cherubs were not originally created for this assignment !
They did not become bored and give up .
Are you a congregation elder or a circuit overseer who feels the weight of your heavy responsibilities ?
What “ work ” must endurance complete ?
Similarly , we are determined to endure until we reach the new world .
“ They continued devoting themselves . . . to associating together . ” ​ — ACTS 2 : 42 .
WHEN Corinna was only 17 years old , her mother was arrested and sent to a Soviet labor camp .
Later , Corinna herself was exiled to Siberia , thousands of miles away from her home .
Nevertheless , all Christians face obstacles .
Secular work , a busy schedule , or fatigue because of our daily routine can make it difficult to attend meetings .
Every congregation meeting helps us to learn about our God , Jehovah .
We also increase our knowledge of God’s Word by paying careful attention to talks , demonstrations , and Bible readings .
Of course , it is not just those who speak from the platform who encourage us .
Why is it so important to be at our meetings ?
The glorified Jesus Christ said : “ Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations . ”
We need holy spirit to help us resist temptation , to embolden and equip us for the ministry , and to enable us to make sound decisions .
When our brothers see us at the meetings and hear us comment and sing , how does this help them ?
No wonder the apostle Paul wrote : “ Let us be concerned about one another ” !
Meetings unite us with fellow believers .
Generally , a flock of sheep stays together under the care of its shepherd .
When you attend meetings regularly , you may very well prove to be a father , mother , brother , or sister to one of these dear ones !
“ When I first heard song number 68 , ‘ A Prayer of the Lowly One , ’ sung by our congregation , I was moved to tears .
Jesus said : “ Where there are two or three gathered together in my name , there I am in their midst . ” In principle , Jesus ’ statement applies to our meetings .
They can be certain that Jehovah understands their situation and deeply appreciates their whole - souled worship .

Unless otherwise indicated , Scripture quotations are from the modern - language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
But not everyone to whom we preach appreciates this .
Dew forms gradually , accumulating drop by drop from the water vapor in the air .
When we show such consideration , our words are more readily absorbed and our ministry is more effective .
Gavin felt refreshed by these conversations and finally accepted a Bible study .
Without the moisture provided by dew , plants wither and die .
Dew is a blessing from Jehovah .
Our ministry can be a blessing to those who respond .
Gavin received just such a blessing .

Individual drops of water achieve very little , but the combined effect of millions of dewdrops saturates the earth with moisture .

When I was 12 , the Spanish Civil War broke out .
His liberal ideas displeased the dictatorial government .
Since I was a very religious girl , I liked the idea of staying at a convent for a while .
Finally I asked for a confessor , and I told him what had happened .
The truth soon touched my heart .
Although I had few opportunities to share the truth with my family , I did do so as much as I could .
As I explained at the outset , they vigorously opposed my beliefs , especially my sister Araceli .
Araceli : My negative experiences in the convent had made me bitter .
And I even got rid of all my images .
I remember that Jehovah’s Witnesses called at my home on several occasions , but I never opened the door .
Eventually , I told them : “ All right .
Felisa : When I got baptized in 1973 , there were about 70 Witnesses in the city of Santander , the capital of the province of Cantabria , Spain .
I remember praying , “ Thank you , Jehovah , for not giving up on me and for giving me so many opportunities to find what I was looking for ​ — the true knowledge of the Bible . ”
Our arguments were replaced with lively Bible discussions .
Felisa : Now at the age of 91 , I am a widow and do not have the strength I once had .
But I do read the Bible every day , attend meetings when my health permits , and enjoy participating in the ministry as much as I can .
I have left many publications with them and have had some interesting conversations .
He studied the Bible and became an unbaptized publisher .
How much we have enjoyed being together , talking about our dear God , Jehovah , and his Word !
Finally , my sisters and I are united spiritually .
“ Pay back . . .
What should we do when it becomes difficult to stay neutral ?
We submit to the authority of the government under which we live by obeying its laws , respecting its officials , and paying the taxes it levies .
We pay back to God what is rightfully his , in part , by remaining neutral in the world’s political affairs .
Additionally , unlike false religions that divide their members by meddling in politics , true worship preserves our international brotherhood by helping us to remain neutral . ​ — 1 Pet .
Let us consider four keys that will help us to succeed .
Man - made governments promote nationalism , which divides the human family .
God lets the world’s political structure remain because it provides a measure of stability that , in turn , helps us to preach the good news of the Kingdom .
Although the Bible teaches that God’s adversary , Satan , has authority over political systems , it does not say that he directly controls each leader or official .

If we are attached to our possessions , we risk compromising our neutrality when we are under test .
Ruth , in Malawi , saw several Witnesses do so when they were persecuted in the 1970 ’ s .
Undue pride .
A third key to maintaining our neutrality is to gain strength from Jehovah .
Pray for holy spirit , which can give you patience and self - control , qualities needed to cope with a government that may be corrupt or unjust .

( See also the box “ God’s Word Strengthened Their Conviction . ” )
Jehovah can strengthen you by means of his Word .
Meditate on verses that will help you maintain your neutrality under test .
God’s Word can also reinforce your hope in future Kingdom blessings .
This hope is essential if we are to endure persecution .
Select passages that describe blessings that you especially hope to enjoy , and visualize yourself experiencing those blessings in Paradise .
Faithful servants of Jehovah provide the fourth key to maintaining neutrality .
For instance , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego refused to worship an image representing the Babylonian State .
Also , Jesus stayed completely separate from the political and social conflicts of the world .
It promotes faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now ruling as King of God’s Kingdom .

Perhaps you cut your hand or scraped your knee .
Maybe she cleaned the wound and then put a bandage on it .

( See the accompanying box . )
Jesus comforted people by giving them wise advice , by treating them kindly , and even , in some cases , by curing their sicknesses .
Moved with pity , Jesus replied : “ I want to !
Consider four principal means that God uses to comfort people .
Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible .
“ I learned to accept any sort of work , and we cut down on all unnecessary expenses . ” ​ — Jonathan
* “ For two years we had to survive on family handouts and a few odd jobs .
Priscilla constantly reminded herself of Jesus ’ words at Matthew 6 : 34 .
He said that we should not become anxious about tomorrow , since each day has its own anxieties .
Although I now have a job , we keep our lifestyle simple in line with Jesus ’ advice at Matthew 6 : 20 - 22 .
The peace of God protected my heart when I turned to him daily in prayer .
I now have new goals in life . ” ​ — Raquel
He showed me Ecclesiastes 3 : 6 and kindly told me that there is a time when we have to ‘ give up as lost . ’
“ Seeing my strength diminish is very hard .
Julian , who has been battling multiple sclerosis for nearly 30 years , feels likewise .
“ I have exchanged an executive’s chair for a wheelchair , ” he says .
“ Although the plane crash took the life of our son , we still have many happy memories of times shared together . ” ​ — Robert
Robert , mentioned in the opening article , has similar thoughts .
He says : “ My wife and I experienced the peace of mind spoken of at Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 . It came to us through our prayers to Jehovah .
I truly believe that Jehovah was supporting us by means of their countless messages of comfort . ”
IMITATE THEIR FAITH | DAVID
DAVID braced himself against the rush of soldiers jostling past him .
What scared them so ?
Even without his formidable armor , he probably weighed more than two large men combined .

The two armies , Philistine and Israelite , remained deadlocked as Goliath repeated his taunts day after day .
In David’s eyes , this pagan Goliath was doing far worse than embarrassing the army of Israel ; he was insulting the God of Israel , Jehovah !
And what can we today learn from the faith of David ? ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 11 - 14 .
Let us go back to a time many months earlier .
Evening was falling as David tended his father’s sheep somewhere on the hillsides near Bethlehem .
The beauty of God’s creation moved him , and his musical skills had grown steadily through many happy hours of practice .
David’s life was never the same after that anointing .
Rather , he leaped right into the fray to defend his father’s helpless sheep .
What outstanding lessons for all of us to learn ! ​ — Ecclesiastes 12 : 1 .
David saw Goliath’s taunts as a direct insult to Jehovah .
Saul and his men had indeed lost heart because of Goliath .
But David did not think that way .
David knew how he had won those battles .
He would place a stone in the pouch , whirl it over his head at great speed , and then release one of the straps , hurling the stone with lethal accuracy .
Just imagine the young man calling out to Goliath : “ You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin , but I am coming against you in the name of Jehovah of armies , the God of the battle line of Israel , whom you have taunted . ”
Goliath had shown disrespect for Jehovah God , and Jehovah would respond .
As David put it , “ the battle belongs to Jehovah . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 45 - 47 .
He did not make the mistake that Saul and the members of his army did .
He loaded his sling and whirled it over his head until it fairly whistled .
And that is just where David aimed . ​ — 1 Samuel 17 : 41 .
Finally , Saul and his soldiers found their courage .
Today , servants of God do not engage in carnal warfare .
Like him , we need to see Jehovah as real ​ — as the only God to serve and to hold in awe .
If we choose Jehovah as our God and we put faith in him as David did , then no challenge , no problem , need daunt us .
Did such a doubt cross your mind as you read the preceding article ?
The Bible says that Goliath’s “ height was six cubits and a span . ”


Some insist that Goliath could not have been that tall , but consider : In modern times , the tallest man documented was over 8 feet 11 inches ( 2.7 m ) tall .
Jesus ’ identity as the Messiah is supported by two detailed genealogies showing that he descended from King David .
Clearly , David was a real man .
The Bible says that the battle occurred in the Valley of Elah .
But it gets still more specific , noting that the Philistines camped on a hillside somewhere between two towns , Socoh and Azekah .
Were these real places ?
Turning , he said , ‘ Over there , to your right , are the ruins of Azekah .
I thought of Saul and David standing right where I was .
More important , it is part of God’s inspired Word , so it comes from the God of truth , the One who “ cannot lie . ” ​ — Titus 1 : 2 ; 2 Timothy 3 : 16 .
“ The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed . . . . It will crush and put an end to all these [ human ] kingdoms . ”
The Kingdom of God rules from heaven . ​ — Matthew 10 : 7 ; Luke 10 : 9 .

Most differences between Christians can and should be resolved privately by the individuals concerned .
He should be treated “ just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector . ”
Such sins might involve a measure of fraud or might include damaging a person’s reputation through slander .
First , an attempt should be made to resolve the issue without involving others .
It may be necessary to reason with the sinner more than once .
What shows that following Jesus ’ counsel is practical and loving ?
As peacemakers , we will enjoy a good relationship with our fellow believers and will promote the unity of the congregation .
Above all , we will have a good relationship with Jehovah , “ the God who gives peace . ”
the message they preach and why they preach it ?
As we know , Jesus foretold that the good news of the Kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth .
Many religious groups feel that they are preaching the Gospel , or good news .
Were Jesus ’ disciples to be passive , waiting for people to come to them ?
After his resurrection , Jesus addressed hundreds of his disciples and told them : “ Go , therefore , and make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them . . . , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you . ”
10 : 7 ; Luke 10 : 3 .
Jesus indicated as much when he invited his disciples to become “ fishers of men . ”
Rather , it involved the use of fishing nets ​ — a labor - intensive activity that at times required the coordinated efforts of many . ​ — Luke 5 : 1 - 11 .
What should be the message of the preaching work ?
What should be our motive for doing this work ?
Jesus preached “ the good news of the Kingdom , ” and he expects his disciples to do the same .
Even some opposers acknowledge this fact .
Jesus told his disciples : “ You received free , give free . ”
The Word of God should not be commercialized .
When speaking of the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses , one researcher stated : “ The main goal is preaching and teaching . . . .
What methods did Jesus and his disciples use to preach ?
They went to the people wherever they could be found ​ — in public areas and in private homes .
As Jesus instructed , they place a high priority on the preaching work .
Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to deliver that message , using methods that Jesus and his disciples used .
Jesus described the scope of the preaching work by saying that the good news would be preached “ in all the inhabited earth . ”
( See opening pictures . )
There are approximately 600,000 members of the clergy in the various denominations in the United States , where there are some 1,200,000 Witnesses of Jehovah .
Over 200 million copies of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures have been published in over 130 languages .
Last year alone , we produced approximately 4.5 billion pieces of Bible literature .
What other group of ministers is doing a similar work ?
How do we know that Jehovah’s Witnesses have God’s spirit ?
How long would the foretold preaching work continue ?
With full confidence , we can say : “ Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ”
Because we are preaching the right message , the good news of the Kingdom .
By going to the people , we are also using the correct methods .
Public employees perform services for which they are paid by the government , and they neither ask for nor expect to receive anything in addition to their normal wages .
Tips are thus demanded by officials who legalize marriages , who accept legitimate income tax payments , who issue building permits , and so on .
In such circumstances , a Christian might view a tip as an additional fee that he is required to pay in order to obtain a legitimate service .
Either action would distort justice . ​ — Ex .
In other cases , after receiving free medical treatment in a public hospital , some Christians give gifts to doctors and nurses out of gratitude for the treatment received .
It is impossible to consider here every conceivable situation in every different land .
Irrespective of local circumstances , therefore , when deciding how to act , Christians should pursue a course that leaves them with a good conscience .
The context shows that Jesus spoke these words in order to correct the thinking of the scribes and the Pharisees , who criticized him for associating with tax collectors and sinners .
We ask , ‘ Since there is joy in heaven , should there not also be joy on earth when a sinner has repented , turned around , and made straight paths for his feet ? ’ ​ — Heb .
12 : 13 .
Investigation of the site has revealed that the two pools were divided by a dam .
It is noteworthy that John 5 : 4 , which said that an angel disturbed the water , is not found in highly regarded ancient Greek manuscripts , such as the fourth - century Codex Sinaiticus .
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES love the Bible .
We view the Bible , not as a collection of human ideas , but “ just as it truthfully is , as the word of God . ” ​ — 1 Thess .
Some especially enjoy the Gospels , which paint a beautiful picture of Jehovah’s personality as reflected in his Son .
And who among us has not found comfort in the Psalms or drawn practical lessons from the book of Proverbs ?
( b ) What publications do we receive for specific groups of people ?
In addition to publications for Jehovah’s Witnesses in general , we receive Bible - based material that appeals to specific groups .
25 : 6 .
What is it ?
Or what if we are not part of the primary audience for a certain publication ?
It will be helpful to consider three suggestions for benefiting from all portions of the Bible and the various types of spiritual food available to us .
He adds : “ Remembering this motivates me to look beyond the obvious . ”
When we reflect on such questions , we will surely get more out of our Bible reading .
As an example , think about the Scriptural qualifications for Christian elders .
Since the majority of us do not serve as elders , we might initially think that this passage would have little application to our own life .
Jehovah wants us to feel safe in the care of the appointed undershepherds .
How can I apply this information in my life ?
How can I use this information to help others ?
We could use the list of qualifications for Christian overseers to help interested ones or Bible students to see ways that elders among Jehovah’s Witnesses differ from the clergy of Christendom .
Also , when reading through the list , we might recall the effort that elders in our own congregation are putting forth in our behalf .
Reflecting on how they expend themselves deepens our “ respect for those who are working hard ” among us .
And the more we show our sincere respect for these hardworking overseers , the more we add to their joy . ​ — Heb .
What significant events occurred when a particular Bible book was written ?
Background information of this nature may bring to light lessons that are not immediately obvious .
Jehovah notices and values the integrity of all his faithful worshippers , including those who are relatively young . ​ — Ps .
148 : 12 - 14 .
Many of the problems addressed in material for young people are not unique to them .
What else do our publications help young people to do ?

“ I have always struggled with Bible reading , ” wrote a 24 - year - old wife and mother .
I can see how the books of the Bible harmonize and are interwoven like a beautiful tapestry .
I have never been this excited over Bible reading . ”
BIBLE STUDIES

5 : 17 .
And look !
2 , 3 . ( a ) Why does the Bible not give us rules for every situation in life ?
However , there are numerous situations for which the Bible provides no specific command .
How does this reflect Jehovah’s wisdom ?
Some may feel that it does not matter what we choose to do .
Under such circumstances , it is our personal responsibility to examine the details and make a choice that is guided , not by mere personal preference , but by what Jehovah will approve of and bless . ​ — Read Psalm 37 : 5 .
Because he was familiar with his Father’s thinking , Jesus knew that he should not turn the stones into bread .
9 , 10 .
Do not become wise in your own eyes .
To acquaint ourselves with Jehovah’s thinking , we need to make personal study a priority .
When reading or studying God’s Word , we might ask ourselves , ‘ What does this material reveal about Jehovah , his righteous ways , and his thinking ? ’
We need to have an attitude like that of the psalmist David , who sang : “ Make me know your ways , O Jehovah ; teach me your paths .
Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me , for you are my God of salvation .
In the ministry ? ’
Reflecting on these thoughts may help us come to a decision that will be practical for us and will have our heavenly Father’s blessing .
Yet , you may know of no specific Bible law that forbids it .
In principle , this counsel applies equally to Christian men .
( b ) When we are choosing entertainment , how can we know what is pleasing to Jehovah ?
The disciple James wrote : “ The wisdom from above is first of all pure , then peaceable , reasonable , ready to obey , full of mercy and good fruits , impartial , not hypocritical . ”
Being aware of this , we should be moved to reject entertainment that fuels impure thoughts and inclinations .
Of course , it would be inappropriate to ask others to make a decision for us .
All of us should act in accord with Paul’s inspired words : “ Each one will carry his own load of responsibility . ” ​ — Gal . 6 : 5 , ftn .
How do we benefit from making decisions that please Jehovah ?
When we base our decisions on Jehovah’s thinking , we draw closer to him .
With diligent effort , however , we can even now acquire the wisdom , knowledge , and discernment needed to make wise decisions .
12 : 2 .
Why does God expect us to put forth effort to overcome our weaknesses ?
1 - 3 . ( a ) What changes may it be hard for us to make after our baptism ?
Kevin admitted , “ Learning to control my temper was actually harder than quitting my old vices ! ”
Regardless of how fervent that desire may be , however , our imperfect state renders us incapable of pleasing God at all times .
7 : 18 ; Jas .
3 : 2 .
It is therefore unrealistic to expect that after baptism ​ — or even after many years in the truth — ​ we will no longer make mistakes , experience setbacks , or be troubled with wrong motives and inclinations .
Certain tendencies might persist for years .
Cultivating our friendship with Jehovah involves striving to imitate God and Christ more closely and being the sort of people they want us to be .
13 : 11 .
Continued effort is required in order “ to be readjusted ” and manifest “ the new personality . ”
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude , and should put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty . ”
Jehovah is pleased to give an appropriate measure of power to his human servants when needed .
Jehovah has given us the peerless gift of free will .
14 , 15 .
By means of his Word and holy spirit , Jehovah helps us to discern his will , to do it , and to change our life to the extent necessary in order to meet his requirements .
In addition to daily Bible reading , we need to study God’s Word along with our Christian publications with a view to imitating Jehovah’s wonderful qualities .
articles that are especially helpful in cultivating Christian qualities or in overcoming particular weaknesses .
Loyal worshippers of Jehovah will eventually have the privilege of serving him forever in perfection .
How can we be sure that the Bible has power to continue changing our life ?
As we see Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts , we will have clear evidence that the Bible can keep changing our life . ​ — Ps .
Note what helped them .
Linda : “ I familiarized myself with our tracts so as to be prepared to offer them .
AFTER days of wind and rain , Monday , September 1 , 1919 , dawned warm and sunny .

Throughout this period of test , faithful Bible Students had been “ watching the Lord’s leading , . . . praying at all times for the Father’s guidance . ”
Now they were reunited in joyful assembly here at Cedar Point .
All week long , delegates puzzled over the letters “ GA ” printed on the convention program , welcome cards , and signs around the convention grounds .
Rutherford finally unveiled the mystery for the 6,000 conventioners .
The Golden Age , “ a Journal of Fact , Hope , and Conviction , ” would be used to open up a new method of spreading the truth ​ — a door - to - door subscription campaign .
When asked how many wished to enter that work , all in the audience leaped to their feet .
A Service Meeting would be held on Thursday evenings for the brothers to share experiences and file service reports .

It comforts people with the good news that God’s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise .
It adheres to the Bible as its authority .
Jesus Christ existed in heaven , in the spirit realm , before he came to the earth .
Jesus ’ Father , of course , is God , whose name is Jehovah , and Jehovah’s “ house ” is in the heavens .
These depictions of God harmonize with the words of the psalmist who wrote : “ Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise .
He is more awe - inspiring than all other gods .
Shortly before Stephen had this vision , Jesus was put to death at the instigation of the very ones whom Stephen was addressing ​ — the Jewish leaders .
God created angels long before man’s appearance .
At the founding of the earth , the angels were on hand to observe and to shout in applause . ​ — Job 38 : 4 - 7 .
Their involvement in this work was revealed in a vision to the apostle John , who wrote : “ I saw another angel flying in midheaven , and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth , to every nation and tribe and tongue and people . ”
“ War broke out in heaven : Michael [ Jesus Christ ] and his angels battled with the dragon , and the dragon and its angels battled but they did not prevail , nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven .
So down the great dragon was hurled , the original serpent , the one called Devil and Satan , who is misleading the entire inhabited earth ; he was hurled down to the earth , and his angels were hurled down with him . ” ​ — Revelation 12 : 7 - 9 .
Thoroughly evil , they bitterly oppose Jehovah and have led most humans on a course contrary to Jehovah’s loving direction .
Satan and his demons are depraved and cruel .
For example , Satan killed the livestock and the servants of the faithful man Job .
Just as Jesus was resurrected from earth to life in heaven , others will be too .
Along with Jesus , they will make up a Kingdom government that will eventually rule over the inhabitants of all the earth and bring blessings to them .
Let your Kingdom come .
Things that have caused so much pain and sorrow to humankind will be no more .
At a future time , they will be restored to life with the prospect of living forever in that Paradise on earth . ​ — Luke 23 : 43 .
To gain Jehovah’s protection , you need to learn what is pleasing to him and then do it .
For example , in the first century , Christians in the city of Ephesus collected all their books on magic and burned them .
These visions assure us that Jehovah God and his Son , Jesus Christ , as well as the faithful angels and those who have been bought from the earth , all deeply care about us and seek our welfare .

“ Ask , please , . . . the birds of the heavens , and they will tell you .
OVER 3,000 years ago , the ancient patriarch Job realized that the birds of the heavens have much to tell us about the handiwork of God .
In the Bible , many of the references to the birds of the heavens teach us important lessons about life and our relationship with God .
Let us look at a few examples .
Swallow
Eagle
Its sight is so powerful that the eagle can reportedly spot a rabbit half a mile ( 1 km ) away .
There the fledgling chicks can also find shelter from the hot sun and heavy rain .
Jesus likewise wanted to offer the inhabitants of Jerusalem spiritual shelter and protection .
The Bible translator who was behind this initiative , Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples ( Latin , Jacobus Faber Stapulensis ) , later wrote to a close friend : “ You can scarcely imagine with what ardor God is moving the minds of the simple [ people ] in some places to embrace his Word . ”
His method of interpreting the Scriptures had a strong influence on other Bible scholars and reformers . ​ — See the box “ How Martin Luther Was Influenced by Lefèvre . ”
Table of titles applying to God in the Psalms , as found in the Fivefold Psalter , 1513 Edition
Born a Catholic , Lefèvre was convinced that a renewal of the church could be possible only if the Scriptures were properly taught to ordinary people .
But how would the common people benefit from the Scriptures at a time when those sacred writings were mostly in Latin ?
Lefèvre’s deep love for God’s Word made him determined to make it accessible to the greatest number of people .
Both men and women were so eager to read Jesus ’ words in their mother tongue that the first 1,200 copies printed were out of stock after just a few months .
And he was convinced that the time had arrived for the Gospels to be “ purely proclaimed throughout the world , so that people may no longer be led astray by alien doctrines of men . ”
They soon ordered that his translation of the Greek Scriptures be burned publicly , and they denounced some other writings as “ favoring the heresy of Luther . ”
When the theologians summoned him to justify his views , Lefèvre decided to remain “ silent ” and fled to Strasbourg .
He strongly believed in “ the right , indeed , the duty , of every Christian to read and learn the Bible personally . ”
Martin Luther was still an obscure monk when he carefully studied Lefèvre’s works .
As told by Bernhard Merten
I cannot do that , because I have neither hands nor arms .
Mother and I lived with my grandparents in Burg , a small town in the former German Democratic Republic , or East Germany .
As a child , I loved those adventures .
My life was carefree and happy .
I saw them only during vacation .
Can you imagine what it is like to eat with a fork or a spoon held with your toes ?
At age 14 , I began to smoke .
I kept myself busy and got involved in social activities .
I also joined a singing club , did poetry sessions , and participated in sports for the disabled .
For the first time , I heard that God has a name .
Confident of my views , I agreed to Bible discussions .
My atheist mind - set was gradually falling apart as we examined Bible prophecies .
Because of the ban , we met in small groups in private homes and I knew only a few fellow believers .
Finally , we could worship Jehovah God in freedom .
I did well and experienced much joy .
I simply want to be a complete man .
I also feel comforted by God’s promise of Paradise , in which he will make “ all things new , ” including my arms .
I have received his help , and my heart rejoices . ” This wonderful truth I want to hold on to all my life .
I embrace it even without hands and arms .
“ Jehovah is near to all . . . who call on him in truth . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 18 .
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE ?
However , they can “ set matters straight ” with him by changing their ways . ​ — Isaiah 1 : 18 .

Questions About Those in the Spirit Realm 3
Lefèvre d’Étaples ​ — He Wanted the Common People to Know God’s Word 10
3 Jehovah “ Cares for You ”
In these two articles , we will see how Jehovah fulfills his role as “ our Potter ” and what we must do in order to be like soft clay in his hands .
18 “ Jehovah Our God Is One Jehovah ”
In today’s diversified and multicultural world , we must understand what Jehovah requires of us so that we can have him as “ our God . ”
Those who treat one another with kindness and generosity often become close friends .
As you can easily see , Jehovah is kind and generous to humans every day .

Is that not a manifestation of his care ?
An example from the Bible gives us the answer .
In that prayer , Jesus likely reviewed many of his disciples by name , considered their qualities and weaknesses , and asked his Father for help in choosing them .
Jehovah is not like that .
In fact , the ransom accomplishes more .
By means of Christ’s sacrifice , God freely forgives those whom he loves .
His Word says : “ Although [ one of God’s servants ] may fall , he will not be hurled down , for Jehovah supports him by the hand . ”
Jehovah ‘ supports his servants ’ in various ways .
Then she offered the book to those present .
how God molds those who submit to him ?
Yet , no human potter can begin to compare with Jehovah .
Late in the sixth creative day , God fashioned “ out of dust [ clay ] from the ground ” a perfect man and gave him the capacity to reflect his Maker’s qualities .
That perfect man , Adam , who was made from the earth was rightly called a “ son of God . ” ​ — Luke 3 : 38 .
2 , 3 .
How can we imitate the attitude of repentant Israelites ?
Nonetheless , throughout the generations “ a great cloud ” of Adam’s descendants have chosen to uphold God’s sovereignty .
Today , all who worship Jehovah in spirit and truth endeavor to reflect the same humble , submissive attitude .
To help us in that regard , let us consider three aspects of Jehovah’s work as our Potter : How he chooses those whom he molds , why he molds them , and how he does so .
When Jehovah observes humans , he does not pay attention to outward appearances . Rather , he examines the heart , the inner person .
This fact was amply demonstrated when God formed the Christian congregation .
He drew to himself and his Son many individuals who from a human standpoint might have seemed to be undesirable .
As they gained accurate knowledge of God’s Word and expressed faith , they allowed Jehovah to mold them .
5 , 6 .
“ When Jehovah’s Witnesses called on me , ” he recalls , “ I would just turn away and ignore them as if they did not exist .
Our accepting Jehovah as our Potter can affect our attitude toward fellow believers too .
4 : 8 , 11 - 13 .
Yes , out of love for his children , Jehovah patiently molds us .
8 , 9 .
We feel safe and secure despite the wicked world around us .
Moreover , in this setting , those of us who grew up in loveless , dysfunctional families finally experience real love .
Above all , we have come to know Jehovah and now experience his fatherly love . ​ — Jas .
4 : 8 .
In the new world , we will experience to the full the blessings of the spiritual paradise .
3 : 11 , 12 .
He knew that his faithful apostles could be molded by kind , patient counsel and by their observing his example of humility .
“ I remember you while upon my bed , ” wrote David .
How does Jehovah mold us by means of holy spirit and the Christian congregation ?
Jehovah will not ignore the sincere petitions of the meek . ​ — Ps .
10 : 17 .
Rather , they humbly look to God , asking for insight and wisdom .
Understanding how God may be molding us can help us in our relationships with fellow believers and in our attitude toward people in our territory , including our Bible students .
In Bible times , a potter did not dig up some clay and immediately begin to shape it .
He first prepared the clay , in part by removing stones and other undesirable matter .
In a spiritual sense , God helps to prepare willing individuals so that he can mold them .
The sister added : “ In time , Tessie was baptized and later served as a regular pioneer , even while she still had young children . ”
To this day , some pottery is still made by hand , the potter working very closely with his material .
SONGS : 60 , 22
WHEN the Jewish exiles entered ancient Babylon , they saw a city filled with idols and found a people enslaved to wicked spirits .
10 : 11 , 19 .
True worshippers today recognize Jehovah as the Universal Sovereign , the one having authority to mold peoples and nations .
Illustrate .
He had a humiliating “ crash ” at God’s hands and died a leper . ​ — Prov .
If so , how did you respond ?
If , however , we begin to develop a critical attitude or to excuse a wrong course rather than seek God’s forgiveness and help , our heart may already be hardening .
We find an example of how lack of faith can harden hearts in the case of the Israelites whom Jehovah delivered from Egypt .
Jehovah was deeply hurt .
We would do well to assess the quality of our faith .
Ask yourself : ‘ Do my priorities and decisions reflect that I truly believe Jesus ’ words ?
What will I do if secular pressures continue to mount ?
Why should we “ keep testing ” whether we are in the faith , and how can we do so ?
Honest self - appraisal in the light of God’s Word should be a regular part of our thinking .
God’s provisions to help us remain like soft clay include his Word , the Christian congregation , and the field ministry .
11 , 12 .
The field ministry can help us to cultivate what qualities , and with what benefits ?
What is more , as we display the Christlike personality , we adorn our message , which may affect the attitude of some householders .
Would the householder have written that if the publishers had shown even a hint of anger ?
Most young children are eager to learn , and they tend to be humble .
Accordingly , wise parents can strive to inculcate knowledge of the truth and love for it in the minds and hearts of their little ones .
“ We resolved to apply the Bible , ” said the parents , “ recognizing that doing things God’s way would result in the best outcome .
So we kept our contact with our son to absolutely necessary family business . ”
He also stated : “ When you are forced to beg Jehovah for help and forgiveness , you realize how much you need him . ”
Why is this adjusted understanding reasonable ?
He also saw a man among them who was “ clothed in linen ” and had “ a secretary’s inkhorn . ”
Ezekiel was not involved with the actual marking of people for survival ; neither are God’s servants today .
Those who do these things will receive the mark of survival during the coming great tribulation .
7 : 1 , 3 .
“ Listen , O Israel : Jehovah our God is one Jehovah . ” ​ — DEUT .
FOR centuries , the six words of the Hebrew text of Deuteronomy 6 : 4 have been used by people of the Jewish faith as part of a devotional prayer .
( Read . )
Of course , they did .
It does not appear that Moses was here refuting the false religious teachings of a triune god .
Jehovah is the Maker of heaven and earth , the Sovereign of the universe .
Some of those false gods were viewed as ruling over certain parts of nature .
Many of these false gods were dealt devastating blows by Jehovah through the Ten Plagues .
6 , 7 .
The passing of 430 years did not diminish Jehovah’s determination to do so . ​ — Gen .
Yes , Moses reminded the people that Jehovah was constant and unchanging in his love and care for them .
That being so , it logically followed that they were to render him exclusive devotion , loving him unreservedly with all their heart , soul , and strength .
6 : 6 - 9 .
Let us , therefore , see how we can show by our actions that we truly understand that “ Jehovah our God is one Jehovah . ”
( b ) How did Hebrew youths in Babylon demonstrate their exclusive devotion to Jehovah ?
1 : 1 – 3 : 30 .
In giving Jehovah exclusive devotion , against what must we be on guard ?
Let us see what meaning that should have for us .
At Colossians 3 : 5 ( read ) , we find strong counsel to Christians regarding what might break their exclusive relationship with Jehovah .
What warning did the apostle John give ?
The apostle John made much the same point when he warned that if anyone loves the things in the world ​ — “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life ” — ​ then “ the love of the Father is not in him . ”
The prophet Isaiah foretold that “ in the final part of the days , ” people of all nations would flock to Jehovah’s elevated place of true worship .
How happy we are to see this prophecy undergoing fulfillment before our eyes !

18 , 19 . ( a ) What counsel is mentioned at Ephesians 4 : 1 - 3 ?
To the Christians in Ephesus , a prosperous and diversified city , Paul offered some practical counsel .
Note that Paul first mentioned such qualities as humility , mildness , patience , and love .
Each of us should accept it as his or her personal responsibility to contribute to maintaining the oneness in the congregation .
What can we do ?

MEMORIAL ATTENDANCE ( 2015 )


What can we do about our own faults and those of others ?
How did the Bible foretell the increase of Jehovah’s people ?
The progress of God’s people is taking place in a very hostile world , which the Bible says is controlled by Satan , “ the god of this system of things . ”
( Read Romans 5 : 12 , 19 . )
Even faithful servants of God in the past said or did things that hurt others , and we can learn from what the Bible reveals about this .
We read : “ The sons of Eli were wicked men ; they had no regard for Jehovah . ”
Had you lived in Eli’s day , how would you have reacted to Eli’s toleration of the sins committed by his sons ?
Would you have let it stumble you to the point that you would no longer serve God ?
How did David sin seriously , and what did God do about it ?
Would David’s wrong conduct have stumbled you ?
( a ) How did the apostle Peter fail to keep his word ?
Another Bible example is that of the apostle Peter .
For example , at a critical moment , the apostles abandoned Jesus .
Peter repeatedly denied even knowing Jesus .
Many other cases in past centuries and in recent times could be cited in which some who served Jehovah committed bad acts and hurt others .
When Judas later betrayed him , Christ did not let that defection mar his own relationship with his Father , Jehovah ; nor did Jesus allow Peter’s denial to do that .
The Bible foretold what about Jehovah’s servants in this time ?
Jesus ’ confidence in Jehovah and his people was well - founded and still is .
It would certainly be unwise and misguided to blame Jehovah or his congregation for the faults of relatively few of God’s servants .
Therefore , it would not be good to expect too much of fellow believers and to let their faults rob us of the joy that comes from being part of God’s people in these last days .
An even greater mistake would be to allow the faults of others to stumble us and cause us to leave Jehovah’s organization .
To maintain our deep joy and firm hope , we want to keep clearly in mind the comforting promise of Jehovah : “ Look !
For example , one principle to remember is what Jesus said : “ If you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . ”
What good example did Joseph set ?
When a famine struck the region , Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food but did not recognize him .
Instead , he tested his brothers to find out if they had changed their disposition .
When he saw that his brothers had truly changed , Joseph identified himself to them .
If we discern that we have done so , the Bible’s direction is to go to the one whom we have offended and try to reconcile matters .
If we practice forgiving others , Jehovah will forgive us .
She told her husband , who like her was an unbaptized publisher .
The couple had serious financial problems and were in debt ; yet , they decided to take the money to the address listed in the passport .
The answers to those questions are not difficult .
It is more precious than corals ; nothing you desire can compare to it . ”
And he inspired the apostle Paul to write to the Hebrew Christians in the first century : “ Keep praying for us , for we trust we have an honest conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ” ​ — Heb .
Will we be honest in situations where a slight omission or twist of words might bring us material gain ?
This notion is so widespread that when material gain is involved , many think that being honest is simply out of the question .
Gagik’s example well illustrates that .
8 : 21 .
I am a good example for my two sons , and I have qualified for privileges in the congregation .
Jehovah has repeatedly shown that he can and will help disadvantaged ones who display honesty at all times .
Being honest allows us to maintain a clean conscience and to have freeness of speech in the ministry
Matthew 16 : 17 , 18 does not say that the apostle Peter would be head of the Christian congregation .

10 .
Jewish copyists first assigned verses to the Hebrew Bible , and in the 16th century , scholar Robert Estienne did likewise for the Christian Greek Scriptures . ​ — wp16.2 , pp . 14 - 15 .
To do that , we need to guard against negative influences that could cause us not to be alert and vigilant with respect to Jesus ’ coming .
Aaron and Stephanie
Really , I could be doing much more for Jehovah than I’m doing right now . ’
That honest self - evaluation motivated her to move to Ghana to expand her ministry .
In 2005 they assisted with disaster relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
They have since helped with a branch construction project in Micronesia .
Hans relates : “ We prayed to Jehovah for guidance because we wanted to go where he directed us .
The couple sent letters to four branch offices .
So they took decisive steps to reach their goal .
My family and I later started to use video chats .
“ My friend became my go - to person whenever I did not understand why people reacted in certain ways .
George and Adria relate that when they first moved to Ghana , they felt as if they had gone back in time .
She adds : “ Being far away from my family , I always turn to Jehovah for help .
He has become more real to me than ever before .
I also experience the outstanding unity found among Jehovah’s people .
Christine and Gideon
Imagine , the need for more teachers is so great that even Bible students are Bible teachers !
Amy relates how she quickly became aware of a great need : “ Shortly after arriving in Ghana , we preached in a small village and searched for deaf individuals .
We found , not one deaf person , but eight deaf persons in that one village alone ! ”
They assist a sign - language congregation to help some of the more than 300 deaf publishers and interested ones in the country .
So how happy they were when they received an invitation to attend the 126th class of Gilead School !
They serve in areas where more Kingdom proclaimers are needed .
110 : 3 ; Prov .
27 : 11 .

What blessings come to us as a result of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness ?
The owner needed more workers , however , and returned to the marketplace throughout the day to hire more and more men , offering a fair wage even to those whom he hired at the end of the afternoon .
When those first hired realized this , they complained .

Do I not have the right to give all my workers whatever I want ?
If we met all of Jehovah’s requirements perfectly , his kindness toward us would be deserved .
Jehovah , however , expressed his love toward fallen mankind in an incomparable act of undeserved kindness .
Yes , “ the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” ​ — Rom . 6 : 23b .
Happily , though , we can choose no longer to be ruled , or dominated , by sin .
How so ? “ Where sin abounded , undeserved kindness abounded still more .
To what end ?
Paul warned Christians : “ Sin must not be master over you , seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness . ”
Paul explained : “ The undeserved kindness of God . . . trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things . ” ​ — Titus 2 : 11 , 12 .
( See opening pictures . )
There will always be an expression of God’s kindness that will match each trial .
Being forgiven of our sins opens the door to many other wonderful blessings .
This reconciliation enables us to be at peace with Jehovah .
Being brought to righteousness .
( Read Daniel 12 : 3 . )
Approaching God’s throne through prayer .
Jehovah in his undeserved kindness grants us the blessing of approaching his heavenly throne in prayer .
How can undeserved kindness “ help us at the right time ” ?
Finding help at the right time .
Paul encouraged us to approach Jehovah freely in prayer , “ so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time . ”
Undeserving as we are , he answers our call , often through fellow Christians , “ so that we may be of good courage and say : ‘ Jehovah is my helper ; I will not be afraid .
Worse still , they endeavored to entice their brothers to join them in their contemptuous ways .
Even today , anyone doing that “ has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness . ” ​ — Heb .
He inspired Peter to write : “ You , therefore , beloved ones , having this advance knowledge , be on your guard so that you may not be led astray with them by the error of the lawless people and fall from your own steadfastness .
Paul answers : “ Since , then , we have gifts that differ according to the undeserved kindness given to us . . . if it is a ministry , let us be at this ministry ; or the one who teaches , let him be at his teaching ; or the one who encourages , let him give encouragement ; . . . the one who shows mercy , let him do it cheerfully . ”
1 , 2 .
How did the apostle Paul show that he was grateful for God’s undeserved kindness ?
What special ministry was Paul given ?
In this time of the end , Jehovah’s people have been commissioned to preach “ this good news of the Kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ”
Do we individually imitate Paul in showing gratitude for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness by zealously sharing in the ministry ? ​ — Read Romans 1 : 14 - 16 .
6 , 7 .
What a relief it is to learn that if we exercise faith in the shed blood of Jesus , our sins will be forgiven and our conscience will be cleansed !
5 : 18 - 20 .
( b ) What wonderful work will the anointed do for mankind ?
Toward them in particular , Jehovah will “ demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness . ”

Millions of humans who died without knowing God will also be resurrected .
But another scroll was opened ; it is the scroll of life . The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds .
Undeniably , the good news highlights Jehovah’s undeserved kindness .
As we witness to others , we can explain that under Christ’s Kingdom rule , mankind will benefit from the full application of the ransom sacrifice and will gradually be brought to perfection .
The Bible says : “ The creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God . ”
When we zealously preach this good news to others , we truly glorify Jehovah’s undeserved kindness !

Why should we control our desire to want more material things ?
Why are you convinced that Jehovah can provide your daily needs ?
What difference is there between what we need and what we want ?
What is the difference ? A “ need ” is something you must have because your life depends on it .
A “ want ” is something you would like to have , but it is not essential for everyday living .
What are some things that people want ?
What is materialism ?
How does Satan use “ the desire of the eyes ” ?
They can ensnare us and distract us from our spiritual routine of studying the Bible , preparing for and attending meetings , and sharing regularly in the ministry .
When the Kingdom message is “ sown among the thorns . . . , the desires for everything else make inroads and choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful . ” ​ — Mark 4 : 14 , 18 , 19 .
; Matt .
What will we consider next , and why ?
Read Matthew 6 : 25 .
Yet , Jesus also realized that ‘ life means more than food and the body than clothing . ’
Earlier in his sermon , Jesus taught his audience to petition their heavenly Father for their physical needs , saying that they could pray : “ Give us today our bread for this day . ”
Yet , they do not have to cultivate the ground and plant seed for food .
They have to go and find it , but the food is there in abundance .
Jesus asked his listeners : “ Are you not worth more than [ the birds of heaven ] are ? ”
Jesus again turns our attention to Jehovah’s handiwork .
Most assuredly he will !
How strong is our faith in Jehovah’s desire and ability to provide for us ?
Our “ godly devotion ” should prompt us to be content with “ food and clothing , ” or “ sustenance and shelter . ” ​ — 1 Tim . 6 : 6 - 8 ; ftn .
If we do that , then , as Jesus said , “ all these other things will be added ” to us .
If a person is unduly anxious about what may happen in the future , he may try to rely on himself rather than on God , and that can adversely affect his relationship with Jehovah . ​ — Prov .
Can you simplify your life to focus more on the Kingdom ?
For good reason , Jesus taught us to seek the Kingdom , not things .
Simplifying our life now will help us to “ get a firm hold on the real life ” yet to come . ​ — 1 Tim .
Eliminate unnecessary expenses
Prepare a realistic budget *
Dispose of things you do not use
( See opening picture . )

As Jehovah’s Witnesses , we take seriously Jesus ’ warning .

However , try as hard as we might , we cannot pinpoint the exact year , much less day and hour , when the great tribulation will begin .
How can we be sure of this ?
Jehovah’s prophecies have always been fulfilled right on time !

They have all come true for you .
( b ) Give an example of what could happen when watchmen fell asleep on the job .
10 , 11 . ( a ) Of what must we be careful , and why ?
How tragic it would be if we were to fail to keep on the watch !
Let us consider three negative influences that could weaken our alertness and vigilance if we are not careful .
What have you detected in your conversations with others ?
How is the spirit of the world affecting mankind , and how can we avoid that dangerous influence ?
13 : 11 - 14 .
Our imperfect flesh can weaken our resolve to stay alert .
Consider what happened the night before Jesus was to be executed .
That is what his companions should have been doing . ​ — Mark 14 : 32 - 41 .
According to Luke 21 : 36 , how did Jesus instruct us to “ keep awake ” ?
Since Jesus said that the end will come “ at an hour that [ we ] do not think to be it , ” this is no time to doze off spiritually , no time to pursue the illusions and fantasies that Satan and his world offer and that our flesh craves .
Through the pages of the Bible , God and Christ tell us what they have in store for us in the immediate future and how we can keep on the watch .
We must be aware of time and events so that we can be ready for what is coming .
When you stop , the footsteps behind you also stop .
For example , are you struggling with a weakness that you would like to overcome but you keep making the same mistake ?
Have you been unemployed for a long time and unable to find a job despite all the efforts you make to find one ?
Or is there something else that distresses you ?
In verses 10 and 13 , Jehovah calls out to his servants : “ Do not be afraid , for I am with you . Do not be anxious , for I am your God . I will fortify you , yes , I will help you , I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness .
Put yourself in the word picture that Jehovah has painted for us .
3 : 23 .
I am here because the elders wanted me to be here .
Takuya recalls : “ I was the one sinning , yet Jehovah , through the elders , extended help to me . ”
Being unemployed is a source of anxiety for many .
Some lose their job and have a hard time finding another source of income .
Imagine how you would feel if you were turned down by one employer after another .
Yet , she wanted to do more for Jehovah , so she quit her job and started to pioneer .
They may find that eating “ a dish of vegetables ” rather than “ a fattened bull ” can be enjoyable and perhaps even better for their health !
If you are focused on pleasing Jehovah , he will provide for you even in your old age .
Yes , but how ?
Through Tony and Wendy , a couple in the congregation who made an apartment available to them .
Seeing that the elderly couple had given their entire lives to Jehovah , Tony and Wendy were moved to take them in .
Some names have been changed .
Joseph had received a special blessing from his father , Jacob .
The kings in the line of Judah had ruled these two tribes , and the priesthood was associated with them , for the priests served at the temple in Jerusalem .
When were these two symbolic sticks joined together ?
It was when the Israelites returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple in 537 B.C.E . Representatives of both the two - tribe kingdom and the ten - tribe kingdom returned together from exile .
31 : 1 , 6 , 31 .
Initially , the prophecy began to be fulfilled in 1919 when God’s people were gradually reorganized and reunited .
They were like the stick for Joseph , and they did not have the hope of ruling with Christ .
How well Jesus ’ words describe the spiritual unity of Jehovah’s people today no matter what hope they have for the future !
It is interesting to note the progression that Jesus used when he told the illustrations that became part of the sign of his presence .

Britain had declared war on Germany in September 1939 when I was 16 .
Each night , I watched as squadrons of German bombers flew over our area .
But soon , guards and prisoners began asking why I was there , and I gladly explained my faith to them .
Those flying bombs were called doodlebugs .
We conducted a Bible study with one family of five .
That entire family eventually got baptized .
When a man threatened us with violence , I complained to a policeman , who said , “ Well , what do you expect ? ”
After the five - month course in New York , four of us Gilead graduates were assigned to the smaller islands of the Caribbean Sea .
Sometimes we went for weeks without being able to send or receive mail .

We used to tell them that there would be a Bible talk .
What happy times !
He and his wife were the first Witnesses of Jehovah in the Dominican Republic , and they had arrived in Puerto Rico in 1957 .
Nathan Knorr , who was then taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses , came to Puerto Rico .
Nevertheless , the next time Maxine and I saw Brother Knorr , he invited us to his room and cooked a meal for us .
From Puerto Rico , we visited my family in England several times .
With Maxine in Puerto Rico shortly after we got married and at our 50th wedding anniversary in 2003
So be happy in your work . It is for Jehovah . ” ​ — 2 Cor .

MARRIAGE is very much a part of life .
A review of its origin and purpose can help us to have a proper view of this relationship and enjoy its intended blessings more fully . After God created the first man , Adam , the animals were brought to him so that he could name them .
But “ for man there was no helper as a complement of him . ”
( Read Genesis 2 : 20 - 24 . )
Jesus confirmed that it was Jehovah who stated : “ A man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife , and the two will be one flesh . ”
There was no arrangement for divorce or for having more than one mate at the same time .
Adam was delighted with his lovely wife , whom he later named Eve .
Though they loved their parents , sons and daughters would leave them to get married and form new households .
How would you explain Genesis 3 : 15 ?
Despite what Satan did in Eden , Jehovah held out hope for mankind in the first Bible prophecy .
( Read Genesis 3 : 15 . )
The rebellion of Adam and Eve had an impact on their marriage and on all marriages thereafter .
For example , Eve and her female descendants would experience much pain during pregnancy and childbirth .
The Bible requires that husbands exercise headship in a loving way .
Before sin and imperfection brought about the death of Adam and Eve , the couple produced sons and daughters .
Cain’s descendant Lamech is the first man reported as having two wives .
What did Jehovah do to the wicked in Noah’s day , and what lesson should we learn from what happened at that time ?
Abraham made sure that his son Isaac married a worshipper of Jehovah .
The basic marriage practices of patriarchal times , including polygamy , were regulated by the Mosaic Law .
When serious problems arose in marriage , help was often provided by the elders .
Unfaithfulness , jealousy , and suspicions were dealt with appropriately .
What was “ indecent ” is not defined , but it is reasonable to assume that it did not include petty issues . ​ — Lev .
If he is unrepentant , the wrongdoer would be disfellowshipped in order to maintain the spiritual purity of the congregation .
He or she would have to “ produce fruits that befit repentance ” before being accepted back into the congregation .
With the cancellation of the Law at Jesus ’ death , God began a new arrangement .
He added : “ Let the one who can make room for it make room for it . ”
Many have chosen to remain single in order to serve Jehovah with an undivided mind .
What can help a Christian to decide whether to get married ?
Whether to stay single or to get married is a matter of determining in one’s heart if one is able to cultivate the gift of singleness .
Getting married can help a person to avoid letting passion lead him to such a practice as masturbation or to sexual immorality .
In addition , age is a factor to consider , for the apostle stated : “ If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly by remaining unmarried , and if he is past the bloom of youth , then this is what should take place : Let him do what he wants ; he does not sin .
Let them marry . ”
Once married , they will undoubtedly agree that the Bible gives the best advice for making their marriage a success .
What kinds of love should marriage mates show ?
The Bible emphasizes the importance of love .

Romantic love ( eʹros ) brings delight , and love for family ( stor·geʹ ) is vital when children enter the picture .
However , it is love based on principle ( a·gaʹpe ) that ensures the success of a marriage .
4 , 5 . ( a ) What is a husband’s responsibility as a family head ?
Focusing on the personal duties of each marriage mate , Paul wrote : “ Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord , because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation . ”
Admitting that marriage calls for adjustments , Cathy says : “ As a single sister , I was independent and took care of myself .
But by seeking Jehovah’s guidance in prayer and really listening to my wife’s input , it gets easier every day .
Yes , both mates will make mistakes .
Sincerely saying “ I am sorry for hurting you ” takes humility and courage , but it goes a long way in solving problems and drawing marriage partners closer together .
( b ) Why do marriage mates need to show tenderness ?
Loving consideration of the mate’s feelings and needs is essential .
10 , 11 . ( a ) How common is divorce ?
Though separation may seem to be the answer when serious difficulties arise , it often causes more problems .

Differences in emotional nature and upbringing may become issues , or disagreements may arise regarding money , in - laws , and child - rearing .
Any children born to them are considered “ holy ” and thus have a standing with God .
What if an unbelieving marriage mate chooses to separate ?
Giving priority to spiritual matters can increase the happiness of your marriage ( See paragraph 17 )
Although we are living in very trying times and marital relationships are failing all around us , it is possible for us to make marriage happy and successful .

When I read about how Jesus , Paul , and others persevered in the ministry , do I meditate on how their perseverance ought to affect my service to Jehovah ? ’

8 Keep Contending for Jehovah’s Blessing
We will also see how Christian parents can make it more interesting for their children to develop faith in God and in his Word .
SONGS : 81 , 32
In what practical ways can we strengthen the hands of our brothers and sisters ?
But you can be assured that God is ready to give you a helping hand . ​ — Read Isaiah 41 : 10 , 13 .
To let the figurative hands drop down has at times been used to describe someone who is discouraged , disheartened , or without hope .
Read Zephaniah 3 : 16 , 17 .
We can take to heart what God told the Israelites , that his mighty ‘ hand is not too short to save ’ his loyal servants .
What vital lessons can we learn from Israel’s victory over the Amalekites ?
Soon after the Israelites were miraculously released from slavery in Egypt , the Amalekites attacked them .
( a ) How did Asa respond when the Ethiopians were threatening Judah ?

God will similarly give us strength to stand firm against opposition , apathy , and anxiety so that we can carry out our preaching work .
Then see how his spirit “ energizes you , giving you both the desire and the power to act . ”
This moved Asa to make many changes so as to restore pure worship .
Moreover , doing that for others helps us to keep our spiritual focus and to feel the reality of what God has in store for us .
SONGS : 60 , 38
Paul ?
Paul compared the struggles of Christians to the exertion of athletes contending in Greek contests , such as footracing , wrestling , and boxing .
These include its doctrines , philosophies , and harmful practices , such as committing immorality , using tobacco , and abusing alcohol and drugs .
Is it really possible to defeat such powerful opponents ? Yes , but not without a struggle .
Jehovah trains us and helps us in our fight .
Are you putting into practice what you are learning ?
( b ) Which Bible characters will we consider ?
To be successful , those who are contending must not lose sight of their reason for struggling .
The patriarch Jacob struggled and persevered because he loved Jehovah , appreciated spiritual things , and had complete faith in Jehovah’s promise to bless his offspring .
Jacob gained the rich reward that we too are seeking ​ — Jehovah’s approval and blessing .
How did Rachel find the emotional and physical strength to continue battling against circumstances that were discouraging but completely beyond her control ?
Understandably , Rachel at one point cried out in triumph : “ With strenuous wrestlings I have wrestled . . .
30 : 8 , 20 - 24 .
The steadfast example set by Jacob and Rachel no doubt had a powerful effect on their son Joseph , influencing how he would handle tests of his own faith .
They kept on contending and acting in harmony with their earnest prayers .
What are some circumstances that might call upon us to wrestle for God’s blessing ?
No matter how long we have been serving Jehovah , all of us must fight against things that might hinder our service to God , who rewards the faithful .
Are you wrestling for God’s blessing ?
If you realize that you have to some extent been affected in a negative way , by all means pray for holy spirit .
12 , 13 .
There are many examples of how God’s Word , his spirit , and our Christian publications have helped Christians to overcome wrong desires .
What was his reaction ?
in The Watchtower of March 15 , 2013 , I really felt that Jehovah does want to help me . ”
Keep struggling . Keep contending . Keep persevering .
“ THIS man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings . ”
One of those “ kings ” was Roman Emperor Nero .
One way that we might do so has to do with Paul’s experiences with the legal systems of his day .
The Mosaic Law was the law of the land in Israel , and it was the moral code for devout Jews everywhere .
They did not force the different ethnic groups of their empire to give up their religions , except when it seemed that there was a danger to the State or to morality .
Rome granted the Jews broad rights in the empire .
They also did not have to share in military service .
Consider one event .

The Christian elders of the Jerusalem congregation heard a rumor being spread among the Jews that Paul was preaching “ an apostasy from Moses . ”
If that happened , Jews who associated with Christians could be punished .
Paul did that , which led to opportunities to ‘ defend and legally establish the good news . ’
Those charges could lead to his being sentenced to death .
He stayed calm and respectful .
The book The Life and Epistles of Saint Paul reports that when Nero accepted a case for him to judge , he heard it in his own palace , where he was aided by a group of advisers who had a lot of experience and influence .
Jesus told his disciples : “ You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a witness to them and the nations . ”
8 : 9 ; Jer .
3 : 12 ; 1 Pet .
3 : 15 .
Some favorable court decisions have refined legal codes , thus protecting freedom of speech and of worship .
10 : 31 .
How do 1 Corinthians 10 : 31 and Philippians 2 : 4 have a bearing on what we wear ?
Boys and men wear a jacket and tie , while the girls ’ and women’s skirt length is . . . in good taste , yet modern . ”
Indeed , Jehovah’s Witnesses are often commended for adorning “ themselves in respectable dress , with modesty and good judgment . . . in the way that is proper for [ those ] professing devotion to God . ”
The Law showed Jehovah’s strong feelings against clothing that does not make clear the distinction between male and female ​ — what has been described in our day as unisex fashion .
And they may be attracted to the God we worship .
7 , 8 .
( See paragraphs 7 , 8 )
Thus we will be proud to identify ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses .
One reason is that God’s people work hard to apply the Bible’s admonition : “ Deaden , therefore , your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality , uncleanness , uncontrolled sexual passion . ”
Jehovah’s standards , however , do not fluctuate with the weather . ​ — Mal .
Hence , our brothers and sisters appreciate it when we refrain from wearing clothes that are so tight or so loose that they are revealing .
Also , when relaxing at the beach or at a swimming pool , the style of swimwear we use should be modest .
Then he added this reason : “ For even the Christ did not please himself . ”
Yes , Jesus put helping others ahead of personal convenience ​ — helping them was key to his doing God’s will .
Christian parents have a responsibility to teach their families to apply Bible principles .
How good it is when parents teach their youngsters where and how to find suitable clothes !
However , Christians are not under the Mosaic Law , nor are they obliged to observe it .
In some cultures , a neatly trimmed beard may be acceptable and respectable , and it may not detract at all from the Kingdom message .
In fact , some appointed brothers have beards .
How grateful we are that Jehovah does not burden us with detailed lists of regulations about our dress and grooming .
Thus , even in our dress and grooming , we can show that we want to ‘ walk in modesty with our God . ’ ​ — Mic .
Our brothers and sisters as well as people in general should be able to see that we fittingly represent our righteous God .

Thanks to Jehovah , I even started a Bible study with my formerly opposed grandmother . ”

When she returned home from the convention , however , she felt that in her case , it was better to avoid even putting herself in a situation that could be spiritually dangerous , so she did not go .

An Australian sister was moved by a Watchtower study article in the issue of December 15 , 2013 , that dealt with the meaning of the Passover . That special observance is closely connected to Genesis 3 : 15 and the coming of the Messiah .
Why did this sister feel that way ?
This helped to strengthen her faith and drew her closer to Jehovah . ​ — Matt .
Jehovah’s prophets , however , always spoke the truth .
And they made plain their own failings and those of other servants of God .
How can young ones grow in appreciation for the value of Bible principles ?
Because of its guiding principles , many are convinced that the Bible was inspired by God .
( Read Psalm 19 : 7 - 11 . )
A young sister in Japan wrote : “ When my family applied Bible teachings , we were truly happy .
They , however , offer no sure hope for a better future . ​ — Ps .
What is an effective way to discuss creation or the Bible with fellow students , teachers , or others ?

Find out what that person believes .
If you are reasonable and willing to listen , he may be inclined to listen to you . ​ — Titus 3 : 2 .
He wrote : “ Every house is constructed by someone , but the one who constructed all things is God . ”
Yes , complex designs are the product of an intelligent mind .
So be a good listener .
Ask sincere questions , and express yourself with mildness and respect , especially when you talk with older ones .
They will also see that you have given much thought to your basic beliefs .
26 : 4 .
Few things build our faith as much as reading God’s Word .
Thinking back on his youth , a circuit overseer said : “ One thing that helped me to appreciate that the Bible is the Word of God was reading it right through .
How can you help them to build a strong faith ?

How might you use illustrations effectively in teaching ?
Our children acquire it little by little . ”
You may feel that you have dealt with a question to your child’s satisfaction . Then you find that he raises the same question again later !

You could also talk with them about the wise directions found at Galatians 5 : 19 - 23 .
4 : 12 .
The point is this : When teaching your children , do not get into a rut .

Something that is very important , of course , is your example of faith .
When a couple in Bermuda have anxious moments , they pray with their children that Jehovah guide them , and they encourage their children to pray on their own .
Only God can make it grow .
6 : 4 .
Paul was urging Hebrew Christians to cooperate with God’s purposes .
Paul used as an example the Israelites who had been saved out of Egypt .
Yet , the Israelites later hardened their hearts and did not exercise faith , so most of them failed to enter into that rest .
The second article shows how true faith is much more than just a mental understanding of the blessings that Jehovah has in store for us .
31 Did You Know ?
My parents , William and Jean , were devoted worshippers of Jehovah .
* So I had many fine examples to imitate .
An intoxicated doctor came by and verbally abused Father because of his Christian neutrality , saying that he was a coward and a draft dodger .
I was frightened but so admired Father .
He just kept on offering the magazines to the crowd that had gathered .
They both left .
With my parents , going to a convention in Wichita in the 1940 ’ s
We found a suitable meeting place and fixed it up .
We took turns , one presented a meeting part while the other answered all the questions .
Finally , an older sister started attending .
Eventually , some Bible students , as well as some inactive ones , began coming to the meetings , and before long we had a thriving congregation .
We called a brother who came and took us to his home and then to the congregation meeting .
This was the first time I clearly saw that Jehovah provided a necessity for me because I was putting Kingdom interests first .
After considering the fine examples we had grown up with , we decided to make ourselves available for anything Jehovah’s organization invited us to do .
Then in 1962 , we were thrilled to receive an invitation to the 37th class of Gilead .
We felt a lump in our throat as we left New York , but how that lump turned to joy when we were met by our brothers at the airport in Nairobi !
We returned to the United States . The day we left Africa , the lump in our throat was much bigger than the one we had when leaving New York .
We took our new assignment as parents very seriously , and we set out to instill the truth in our beautiful girls .
We wanted to mirror the examples that had been set for us .
Though young , they asked such questions as “ What will I do when I grow up ? ”
We kept before them the goal of the full - time ministry and the wisdom of marrying only someone with a similar goal .
We coined the phrase “ Stay free until you are at least 23 . ”
As they got older , they complained at times about having the family study .
Then we began to realize that we really were instilling appreciation for spiritual matters in their young hearts .
It was hard at times , though , to hear them say that they did not agree with some aspect of the truth .
This project of raising our daughters went by much faster than we could have imagined .
With Paul , Stephany , Kimberly , and Brian at the Malawi branch office , in the year 2002
Brother Marais , the overseer of Translation Services , explained that the brothers were arranging for a course in English comprehension for translators around the world , and at age 64 , I was being considered for training to be one of the instructors .
As she would have encouraged us to do , we immersed ourselves in our new work .

Why might we need to adjust our view of strangers ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What challenges do many strangers face today ?
So let us consider the following questions : How does Jehovah view strangers ?
After Jehovah delivered his people from Egypt , he gave them a set of laws that showed special consideration for the many non - Israelites who had joined them .
Rather than order the Israelites to respect foreigners , Jehovah appealed to their empathy .
( Read Exodus 23 : 9 . )
What will help us to reflect Jehovah’s concern for people from a foreign background ?
Today , we can be sure that Jehovah is equally concerned about people from a foreign background who attend meetings in our congregations .
What shows that first - century Christians learned to overcome deep - seated prejudices ?
The loving concern of Jewish Christians for fellow believers from other lands showed that they understood the meaning of the word “ hospitality , ” that is , “ kindness to strangers . ”
( b ) What must we root out of our heart ?
Likewise , if we detect any trace of prejudice or racial pride in us , we should make a conscious effort to root it out of our heart .
We should have a view like that of the apostle Paul , who admonished his fellow anointed Christians that they were “ no longer strangers and foreigners , but . . . members of the household of God . ”
On hearing that she had asked permission to glean ​ — even though she was within her full right to do so — ​ Boaz generously allowed her to glean even among the sheaves . ​ — Read Ruth 2 : 5 - 7 , 15 , 16 .

Are we warmly greeting newcomers when they arrive at the Kingdom Hall ?
We can show kindness to newcomers from a foreign background by warmly greeting them at the Kingdom Hall .
We may have noticed that new immigrants are sometimes shy and stay by themselves .
You may feel awkward about approaching those from another culture .
What will help us to be more understanding toward those who are adjusting to a new country ?
We may realize , though , that they need practical help to learn the language .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 1 ) Name has been changed .
SONGS : 142 , 92
( b ) What specific challenges do those learning a new language face , and what questions does this raise ?
Are you perhaps serving as a missionary or a need - greater in a foreign land , or have you begun attending meetings in a foreign - language congregation in your homeland ?
In addition to learning a new tongue , those serving in a foreign field also need to make sure that they regularly feed their heart with solid spiritual food .
Give an example .
8 : 2 , 8 .
5 , 6 .
When we read in a foreign tongue , our heart may not be as involved as it would be in our own language .
Moreover , the court official in charge of their training gave them Babylonian names .
King Nebuchadnezzar likely wanted to impress Daniel with the idea that his God , Jehovah , had been subjected by Babylon’s god . ​ — Dan .
The writer of Psalm 119 found strength in God’s Word to stand out as different .
He had to put up with the scornful attitude of some members of the royal court .
( b ) How can we reach our goal ?
Our aim , though , should not be simply to cover a certain number of pages or solely to prepare comments to participate at meetings .
Since my mind is mainly involved in an intellectual exercise , my heart is not necessarily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
“ When we realized that this situation had hindered our son from making spiritual advancement , ” explains Serge , “ we decided to move back to our former congregation . ”
In such circumstances , Christian parents might consider moving back to a congregation that uses the language their children best understand until their children take a firm stand for the truth . ​ — Read Deuteronomy 6 : 5 - 7 .
Muriel , quoted earlier , admits that she and her husband had to sacrifice their preferences for the spiritual benefit of their son .
( Read Romans 15 : 1 , 2 . )
He states : “ From the time we moved back to a French - speaking congregation , our son blossomed spiritually and got baptized .
He is now serving as a regular pioneer . He is even considering returning to a foreign - language group ! ”
Whatever our personal circumstances , though , we should be determined to feed our heart with solid spiritual food .
119 : 11 .

to draw his attention to God’s Word

The boy would choose the silver coin and run away .
The little boy smiled and said , “ Yes , I know . ”
“ Then why do you take the silver coin ? ” the visitor asked .
“ If you take the gold one , you will have twice as much money ! ”
Someone who has understanding can see how one fact relates to another .
A person who has wisdom is able to combine knowledge with understanding and put them to work in a practical way .
He may just have a quick mind .
One of the men is described as being “ discreet . ”
Thinking ahead about what could happen , that man built his house on rock . He was farsighted and practical .
Now the question is , How can we gain and safeguard this valuable quality of practical wisdom ?
Second , Proverbs 18 : 1 says : “ Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires ; he rejects all practical wisdom . ”
Then , instead of ‘ rejecting all practical wisdom , ’ we will be strengthening this important quality .
For example , the Bible urges a wife to have “ deep respect ” for her husband .
How can a husband gain deep respect ?
In an effort to secure her husband’s love , a wife may reason that it is better to hide unpleasant things from him that he has a right to know .
Really , though , does that reflect practical wisdom ?
How you discipline your children today will affect communication with them later
For example , suppose a child speaks disrespectfully to one of his parents .
Parents developing practical wisdom will think about the way they discipline their children and the effect this will have on the children in the future .
Parents should not quickly react to the embarrassment of the moment .
Then when the child shows that he respects his parents , he will realize that he is honoring Jehovah .
He senses his parents ’ sincere care , and his respect for them grows .
Some parents may feel bad about possibly hurting their child’s feelings , so they avoid giving correction .
Will he fear Jehovah and recognize the wisdom of accepting God’s standards ?
13 : 1 ; 29 : 21 .
SONGS : 81 , 134
All of us , whether of the anointed or of the “ other sheep , ” hope to see the fulfillment of God’s original purpose and the sanctification of Jehovah’s name .
And what are the benefits of having a strong faith in what you hope for ?
True Christian faith is based on what fact ?
Faith is not a quality that sinful humans are born with ; nor does it develop naturally .
Because Jehovah is almighty and all - wise , nothing can stop him from fulfilling his purpose .
Christian faith stems from the fact that Jehovah is “ the faithful God , ” who always does what he promises . ​ — Deut .
7 : 9 .
All of them had an “ assured expectation ” that God would raise up the promised “ offspring ” to crush Satan’s rebellion and to fulfill Jehovah’s original purpose .
Nevertheless , thanks to Jehovah’s unfailing promises , they will be resurrected to perfect human life in an earthly paradise . ​ — Ps .
13 : 14 .
( See opening picture . )
One of these was Abraham .
To be “ happy ” and to “ succeed , ” we must regularly read God’s Word , daily if possible .
Prayer also played a vital part in keeping the faith of pre - Christian witnesses strong .
Their faith was strengthened as they experienced God’s answers to their prayers .
We too can pour out our concerns to Jehovah , knowing that he will hear us and strengthen us to endure with joy .
Our prayers , though , should not be limited to asking God for personal help .
Daniel and his companions clearly had the opportunity to “ accept release ” by compromising their integrity .
18 : 13 ; 22 : 24 - 27 ; Jer .
Sometime after the Kingdom’s birth in 1914 , all such faithful anointed ones , who were sleeping in death , were raised to spirit life in heaven to share with Jesus in his rulership over mankind . ​ — Rev .
Consider the example of Rudolf Graichen , who was born in Germany in 1925 .
Such pictures made a lasting impression on me . ”
How can strong faith protect you ?
Most of Jehovah’s people have not had to endure severe persecution .
Others are like Moses and the patriarchs in that they have given up a life of worldly ease or fame .
What is it that enables them to do this ?
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 14 ) See also the article “ Despite Trials , My Hope Has Remained Bright ” in the April 22 , 2002 , issue of Awake ! , which tells the life story of Andrej Hanák from Slovakia .
How should we view Christian faith ?
That , then , opens up the prospect of enjoying an everlasting relationship with Jehovah .
So we began to exercise faith in Jesus with everlasting life in view . ​ — Read 1 John 4 : 9 , 10 .
Faith involves much more than a mental understanding of God’s purpose .
Why is faith so important , and how can we keep it strong ?
In this context , the Greek word translated “ evident demonstration ” refers to “ convincing evidence ” of an invisible reality , such as the existence of Jehovah God , Jesus Christ , the angels , and the activities of the heavenly Kingdom .
How does Noah’s example help us to understand what it means to have faith ?
Noah exercised his faith by building the gigantic ark .
James goes on to show the clear difference between mere belief and the exercising of one’s faith .
Then to drive home the point that faith must be shown by works , James adds : “ Just as the body without spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead . ” ​ — Jas .
How does the apostle John help us to understand the importance of exercising our faith ?
For example , John explained : “ The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains upon him . ”

Exercise your faith by sharing the good news at every opportunity ( See paragraph 12 )
3 : 5 , 8 - 10 .
“ Without faith , ” the Bible states , “ it is impossible to please God well , for whoever approaches God must believe that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ”
God’s Word describes “ faith in God ” as part of the “ foundation ” that is needed for anyone to become and remain a true Christian .
14 , 15 .
The Christian Bible writers emphasized the importance of faith by referring to it hundreds of times .
Does this mean that faith is the most important Christian quality ?
Jesus emphasized the all - important quality of love for God when he answered the question : “ Which is the greatest commandment in the Law ? ”
16 , 17 .
But the need to grow in love for God and for our neighbor will never cease .
It has been accomplished by our God .
Our spiritual paradise will continue to grow and to flourish until the whole earth is filled with perfect , righteous , and happy humans to the eternal praise of Jehovah’s name .
May we keep on exercising our faith in Jehovah’s promises !
According to this work ( Digest , 9.2.27.14 ) , the jurist Ulpian referred to a case considered by the second - century Roman statesman Celsus .
That such malicious mischief occurred within the Roman Empire in ancient times indicates that the situation Jesus described was true to life .
His main concern was to collect taxes for Rome and to maintain peace and order .
Yet , “ its most serious restriction , ” notes scholar Emil Schürer , “ was that the Roman authorities could at any time take the initiative themselves and proceed independently , as in fact they did when they suspected a political offence . ”
3 A Word That Meant So Much !
4 “ Keep On Encouraging One Another Each Day ”
The apostle Paul also considered encouragement to be very important .
9 Organized in Harmony With God’s Own Book
These articles answer the following questions : Why should we expect Jehovah’s worshippers to be organized ?
How can we show that we loyally support Jehovah’s organization ?
We will also consider the firm stand the Bible Students took regarding Babylon the Great , and we will learn when the Babylonian captivity ended .
For example , when healing a disabled person who had been bent double for 18 years , he said : “ Woman , you are released from your weakness . ”
Jesus used it when he spoke to a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for 12 years .
The woman quietly made her way through the crowd , approached Jesus from behind , and touched the fringe of his outer garment .
Go in peace , and be healed from your grievous sickness . ” ​ — Mark 5 : 34 .
“ Daughter . ”
They are thrilled to hear a special announcement .
Israel’s elderly king has received the architectural plan through inspiration and has given it to Solomon .
“ The work is great , ” says David , “ for it is not a temple for man but for Jehovah God . ” ​ — 1 Chron .
The Israelites sprang into action .
Centuries later , Jehovah set up something far greater than the temple .
24 : 14 .
In addition to gifts of money and valuable personal property , there are other methods of giving to benefit Kingdom service worldwide . These are listed below .
Regardless of the method or methods you would like to use , please first contact the branch office that serves your country to see which methods are available .
Since legal requirements and tax laws vary , it is important to consult qualified tax and legal advisers before choosing the best way to donate .
The donor may receive an income - tax deduction for the year in which the gift annuity is established .
This arrangement may provide certain tax advantages . As the term “ charitable planning ” implies , these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor .
To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses through some form of charitable giving , a brochure entitled Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide has been prepared .
The information covered in this brochure may not apply fully to your situation because of tax laws or other laws in your country .
In the late 1800 ’ s , what efforts did the anointed make to understand God’s Word correctly ?
36 : 17 , 19 .
Through Jeremiah , Jehovah advised the future exiles to accept their new situation and make the most of it .
Babylon was a center of trade and commerce in the ancient world , and documents that have been unearthed indicate that many Jews learned the art of buying and selling there , while others became skilled craftsmen .
Exile in Babylon was nothing like the slavery in Egypt that the Israelites had experienced centuries before . ​ — Read Exodus 2 : 23 - 25 .
55 : 11 .
However , for the reasons that we shall outline in this article and in the one following , a reexamination of the subject was necessary .
Thus , in order to be subject to Babylonian captivity in 1918 , God’s people would have had to become enslaved to false religion in some way at that time .
At Pentecost 33 C.E . , thousands of Jews and proselytes were anointed with holy spirit .
These new Christians became “ a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for special possession . ”
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 9 , 10 . )
However , especially after the death of the apostles , men arose who spoke “ twisted things ” in order to “ draw away the disciples after themselves . ”
On the basis of what they read in the Bible , some among them rejected the unscriptural creeds of the church , but it was dangerous ​ — even fatal — ​ to express such opinions openly .
As a result , only the clergy and some other educated people could read the Bible for themselves , although not all of the clergy could read and write well .
Faithful anointed servants of God had to meet together in discreet groups ​ — if they could meet at all .
Explain .
Would true Christians ever be free to worship God openly and acceptably ?
Glimmers of spiritual light began to penetrate the darkness , thanks to two important factors .
The first was the invention in the mid - 15th century of a printing press that used movable type .
It has been said that it would take ten months for a skilled copyist to produce just one handwritten copy of the Bible !
Innovations in printing and courageous Bible translators helped loosen Babylon’s grip ( See paragraphs 12 , 13 )
The second notable factor was the decision by a few courageous men at the dawn of the 16th century to translate God’s Word into the languages spoken by the common people .
Nevertheless , a few brave souls refused to be cowed by Babylon the Great . They had now had a taste of God’s Word ​ — and they wanted more !
The stage was being set for a future deliverance from false religion .
( b ) Describe Brother Russell’s quest for the truth .
They wanted to read and study and converse with one another without being told what to think .
At one point , he met with a number of local clergymen in hopes that these men would accept the truths that Russell and his associates had discovered from the Bible and teach them to members of their congregations .
( a ) When did Christians come under the yoke of Babylon the Great ?
( b ) What questions remain for the next article to answer ?
However , a number of questions arise : What additional evidence is there that in the decades leading up to 1914 , the anointed were actually breaking free from Babylon the Great , no longer being enslaved by her ?
And did some of our brothers during that period compromise their Christian neutrality and thereby incur Jehovah’s displeasure ?
Finally , if Christians went into bondage to false religion from the second century C.E . onward , when did they get freed ?
SONGS : 72 , 82
When were the anointed freed from Babylonian captivity ?
The good news , though , is that they would not remain in that condition indefinitely .
During World War I , what was the relationship between God’s people and Babylon the Great ?
What can we conclude ?
In years gone by , we believed that Jehovah became displeased with his people because they did not have a zealous share in the preaching work during World War I .
We concluded that for this reason , Jehovah allowed Babylon the Great to take them captive for a short time .
There is strong evidence to support this testimony .
A more accurate understanding of our theocratic history has led to a clearer comprehension of certain events recorded in the Bible .
In 1914 alone , the small number of Bible Students presented the “ Photo - Drama of Creation ” to more than 9,000,000 people .
Reports further indicate that in 1916 a total of 809,393 attended public meetings in the United States , and in 1918 the number rose to 949,444 .
Those Bible Students were zealous !
During the first world war , no effort was spared to keep providing spiritual food and encouragement to the scattered Bible Students .
Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible . ”
Although they were sincere , the brothers did not always have a proper view of subjection to the secular governments .
What firm stand did the Bible Students take with regard to the sacredness of life ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) Why were eight responsible brothers sentenced to long prison terms ?
( b ) Did incarceration break the brothers ’ determination to obey Jehovah ?
As representatives of the Watch Tower Society , Brothers Rutherford , Van Amburgh , and six others were arrested .
Macmillan , p . 99 ) It was . The eight Bible Students were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta , Georgia .
Even while in prison , the eight men held steadfastly to the Scriptures as they understood them .
Hence such members could not willingly and conscientiously engage in the taking of the life of human beings . ”
Bold words those ! Clearly , the brothers had no intention of compromising !
In 1919 , a “ faithful and discreet slave ” was appointed to provide spiritual food to the household of faith .
Satan’s effort to eradicate true Christianity from the earth has failed miserably .
A front - page service report spanning ten years from 1928 to 1937 proved the point .
What had caused the field ministry to lose its impetus in Britain ?
Enthusiastic pioneers zealously focused on the field ministry
“ It was a call to action from headquarters , which most of us had been longing for and which soon brought wonderful results , ” recalled Hilda Padgett .
F .
Wallis reported : “ The five - hour day suggestion was grand !
He remembered groups on bicycles spending whole days in the ministry and in the summer evenings playing recorded talks .
The Informant also issued this fresh appeal : “ We need a pioneer army of 1,000 . ”
Jim Carr , serving as a zone servant ( now known as a circuit overseer ) in 1938 , followed the suggestion to set up pioneer homes in cities .
Groups of pioneers were encouraged to live and work together , thus cutting costs .

Why is encouragement a power for good ?
“ MY PARENTS hardly ever encourage me , but they criticize me a lot . And their words can be so hurtful , ” says Cristina , who is 18 years old .
On the other hand , encouragement is a power for good .
“ I have fought feelings of worthlessness for many years , ” says Rubén .
And how can we give encouragement that is effective ?
“ Children . . . need encouragement like plants need water , ” explains educator Timothy Evans .
Some parents do not commend their children because their own parents never gave them any encouragement .
What does encouragement involve ?
( Read Ecclesiastes 4 : 9 , 10 . )
“ If you become discouraged in the day of distress , ” says Proverbs 24 : 10 , “ your strength will be meager . ”
And just imagine how encouraged the elderly prophet Daniel was when God sent an angel to strengthen him .
God thus commended Jesus and assured him that he was doing well .
What can we learn from the way Jesus treated his apostles ?
Jesus .
Yet , Jesus commended his faithful apostles for sticking with him in his trials .
For instance , Paul described Timothy as his “ beloved and faithful child in the Lord , ” one who would genuinely care for the concerns of other Christians .
The apostle commended Titus to the Corinthian congregation as “ my companion and a fellow worker for your interests . ”
Their encouragement makes me feel so much better ! ”
1 : 11 , 12 .
Consider Joshua .
So let us personally encourage elders , including circuit overseers , who work hard to care for the flock of God .
“ Sometimes the brothers give us a thank - you letter saying how much they enjoyed our visit , ” stated one circuit overseer .
When Paul commended the Corinthians for applying his counsel , they must have been encouraged to continue doing what was right .
You nail down counsel by giving encouragement .
What is one step we can take to encourage others ?
Show appreciation for the fine efforts and positive qualities of fellow worshippers .
Jehovah and Jesus greatly value what all of us do to support Kingdom interests , even if our efforts and contributions are limited because of our circumstances .
If we can offer a word of encouragement , why not speak up ?
We will very likely find that if we make it a habit to be encouraging , people will encourage us in return . ​ — Luke 6 : 38 .
18 , 19 .
We will very likely find many ways to build others up spiritually if we are determined to apply Paul’s counsel : “ Keep encouraging one another and building one another up , just as you are in fact doing . ”
Why is it reasonable to conclude that Jehovah’s worshippers would be organized ?
We will also consider how we should respond to the direction we receive from Jehovah’s organization .
In the first century C.E . and in our day , the Scriptures have helped the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization to do the far - reaching work of preaching the good news .
What convinces you that Jehovah is the incomparable Organizer ?
“ He solidly established the heavens in discernment . ”
Yet , the little we know about planets , stars , and galaxies moves us to acknowledge that these celestial bodies are superbly organized .
Science has revealed much about the universe and our earthly home , and it has brought us advantages in various aspects of life .
Also , people in general cannot explain why mankind has a strong desire to live forever .
Why are there so many important but unanswered questions ?
The people of ancient Israel were a model of organization .
The first - century Christian congregation was organized , and it benefited from the direction of the governing body , initially made up of the apostles .
We might well ask ourselves : ‘ Do I contribute to the spirituality of those around me ?
The circuit overseer tries to get to know the men who are recommended and to work with them in the field service if possible .
He also observes the family of the brother under consideration .
The body of elders and the circuit overseer carefully consider the Scriptural qualifications for ministerial servants and elders . ​ — 1 Tim .
5 : 1 - 3 .
Paul directed : “ Keep this one marked and stop associating with him . ”
If you are aware of the situation described in the talk , will you take care to avoid socializing with such an individual ?
Your loving concern and firm stand may move the person to abandon a disorderly course .
How can we contribute to the congregation’s cleanness ?
Consider the situation in ancient Corinth .
Some have taken their brothers to court , but God’s own Book helps us to see that it is better to suffer loss than to bring reproach on God’s name or disturb the peace of the congregation .
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 - 17 . )
Foretelling the future condition of his people , God declared : “ In unity I will place them , like sheep in the pen . ”
How grateful we are to have the privilege of worshipping Jehovah in unity !
If unity and cleanness are to be maintained in a congregation , the elders must care for judicial matters promptly and in a loving way .
So Paul did not hold back from writing First Corinthians , a strong yet loving letter .
6 : 1 .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 13 ) See Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , pp . 134 - 136 .
How might the differences between Euodia and Syntyche have arisen , and how can such problems be avoided ?
Being imperfect , we all receive Scriptural counsel at times .
Consider the first - century Christians Euodia and Syntyche .
Suppose Euodia invited some brothers and sisters to her home for a meal and pleasant association .
The Bible does not tell us the outcome , but these sisters may have responded well to the apostle Paul’s loving counsel . ​ — Phil .
However , such problems can be solved or even avoided if we apply the counsel found in God’s Word , the Bible .
4 , 5 .
It is not easy to control our emotions when we feel that we have been slighted or treated unjustly .
Jehovah has observed human relations since mankind’s beginning .
Jehovah and Jesus take forgiveness very seriously .
What are some directives , or instructions , provided in the Bible for our benefit ?
And Jehovah decrees that all those in his organization must be clean physically and spiritually . ​ — 2 Cor .
How is the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization described in the book of Ezekiel ?
Think about the many organizational changes that have been made during the past decade ​ — and bear in mind that Jehovah is behind such developments .
Construction .
How thankful we are for the many willing volunteers who work tirelessly on such projects !
Education .

How Jehovah loves to educate his people !
As this world sinks deeper and deeper into debauchery , we must “ hate what is bad , ” as Jehovah does .
The spirit of the world is unacceptable in a Christian home .
( Read Romans 14 : 12 . )
We need our heavenly Father’s help because we are unable to direct our own steps . ​ — Jer .
The young woman poured out her heart to Jehovah , as the Scriptures tell us to do .
Do you think that this mother felt that Jehovah answered her heartfelt prayer ?
Undoubtedly , she did feel that way .
What direction have we received regarding Bible students ?
It has been suggested that when we finish studying the Bible Teach book with a progressive student , we study the book “ Keep Yourselves in God’s Love ” with him , even if he is baptized by that time .
The organization has given this direction so that new disciples will be “ stabilized in the faith . ”
In Romans chapters 6 and 8 , we find vital information related to our life as Christians .
It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
As told by Denton Hopkinson
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah .
From that time on , my mother and I shared regularly in the field service together .
These were rather bulky and weighed about ten pounds ( 4.5 kg ) .
Just imagine me , a young boy , lugging one of those !
After working for two years , I consulted another circuit overseer about pioneering . He said , “ Go for it ! ”
Advertising a public lecture with others in Rochester , New York , 1953
However , in December 1952 , I was called to report for military service .
We had to wait several months for our visas ; then we were on our way by ship via Rotterdam , the Mediterranean Sea , the Suez Canal , the Indian Ocean , Malaysia , and Hong Kong ​ — 47 days at sea !
Then started the adjustment to a new people , a new land , and even a new language .
Our next assignment would help solve that problem .
I soon learned that it was the custom in the Philippines in those days for a public talk to be really public !
My bed was often a woven mat on a wooden floor .
Through all my years of service , I have never owned a car .
I never had a formal language course , but I learned by listening to brothers in the field service and at the meetings .
What a delight it has been to serve with our brothers in the Philippines !
The number of publishers is now about ten times what it was when I began serving here .
How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why should we not be surprised when we experience some anxiety ?
Therefore , it is not surprising that at times even we , God’s servants , experience some feelings of anxiety .
How can you “ throw your burden on Jehovah ” by means of prayer ?
A first step we can take is to approach Jehovah in earnest prayer .
After you have done all you can to solve a problem , heartfelt prayer will certainly accomplish more than worry .
How ?
Thus “ the peace of God ” can triumph over any challenge you may face .
1 : 7 - 9 .
He showed loving consideration for others ’ spiritual , emotional , and physical needs .
This puts at your disposal a third , powerful means to alleviate anxiety ​ — the fruitage of the spirit .
Thus , you will find that many situations that could otherwise cause anxiety do not arise .
“ Patience , kindness , goodness . ”
“ Mildness , self - control . ”
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Never be anxious ” ?
He trusted in Jehovah’s mercy and forgiveness .
( b ) What practical steps can you take to reduce anxiety ?
Nevertheless , he did not allow anxiety to destroy his confidence in Jehovah .
David made his problems a subject of fervent prayer , but he also understood the value of taking practical steps to deal with the cause of the anxiety .
PHILIPPIANS 1 : 10 , 11
Have realistic expectations .
MATTHEW 14 : 23
How can the meaning of God’s name strengthen your faith ?

Moreover , there is no situation beyond the control of the God on whom you can throw all your anxiety .

17 , 18 .
Jehovah also helps Christians to deal with anxieties by means of weekly congregation meetings .
Consider how a congregation elder in Canada learned the value of throwing his anxiety on Jehovah .
11 : 6 .
SONGS : 136 , 139
As one expression of his tender love , Jehovah has taken the initiative to bless his loyal servants .
What promise is found at Malachi 3 : 10 ?
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
Instead of rebuking Peter for asking that question , Jesus told his disciples that they would be rewarded for their sacrifices .
But even now there are rewards .
Why does Jehovah promise his worshippers a reward ?
Besides enjoying rich spiritual blessings now , Jehovah God’s faithful servants eagerly look forward to even greater blessings in the future .
Aside from those who will receive a reward in heaven , the prospect of everlasting life on a paradise earth is indeed reason to “ rejoice and be overjoyed . ”
God’s promises act like spiritual balm that soothes our anxious heart .
How sure can we be of Jehovah’s blessing ?
To receive the reward , we need to exercise full faith in Jehovah and be obedient to his directions .
The Bible was recorded for our benefit .
When his wife bore him two sons , “ Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh , for he said , ‘ God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father . ’
The point is , Joseph recognized that it was Jehovah who had rewarded him and blessed him . ​ — Gen .
45 : 5 - 9 .
How did Jesus remain faithful when under trial ?
Jesus Christ likewise remained obedient to God through various tests of his faith , and he was rewarded .
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Furthermore , he was rewarded with his Father’s approval and many wonderful privileges .
The Bible reports that he “ has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . ”
13 , 14 .
He shows us compassion if financial burdens weigh us down or our health or emotions tend to limit our sacred service .
And we can have full confidence in Jehovah’s tender regard for what his servants do to stay faithful to him . ​ — Read Hebrews 6 : 10 , 11 .
“ The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort ” will unstintingly give us the emotional and spiritual support that we need , perhaps doing so by means of our fellow worshippers .
( See opening picture . )
37 : 11 .
Let us never forget , though , that “ God is greater than our hearts and knows all things . ”
How good it is to reflect on how Jehovah is rewarding you at this time and how he will reward you in the future !
So let us now continue to strengthen our faith and to work whole - souled as to Jehovah .
We can do this , knowing that it is from Jehovah that we will receive the due reward . ​ — Read Colossians 3 : 23 , 24 .
How is it that we can consider ourselves “ dead with reference to sin ” ?
Would Romans 5 : 12 be high on your list ?
That verse is repeatedly used in the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
Yet , we are assured that God remembers that we are made of dust , and he is willing to show us mercy .
( b ) What is the “ undeserved kindness ” that is mentioned at Romans 3 : 24 ?
This will help us to understand how Jehovah can forgive us .
Scholar John Parkhurst noted : “ When spoken of God or Christ , it [ that Greek word ] very often particularly refers to their free and undeserved favour or kindness in the redemption and salvation of man . ”
Moreover , imperfect , sinful humans did not of themselves merit , or deserve , what God and Jesus did in providing a ransom by which forgiveness was possible .
While they were still alive on earth , how could it be said of them that they had “ died with reference to sin ” ?
Then they had the heavenly hope .
But Paul could speak of them while they were still alive and serving God on earth as having “ died with reference to sin . ”
They were no longer obeying the dictates or impulses of their sinful desires .
It could be said that we “ were slaves of sin . ” Then we came to know Bible truth , made changes in our lives , dedicated ourselves to God , and got baptized .
Since then , it has been our desire to be “ obedient from the heart ” to God’s teachings and standards .
Or am I dead with reference to sin ? Am I living with reference to God by Christ Jesus ? ’
Their past way of life may have included “ things of which [ they ] are now ashamed ” and that would have merited death .
Then they changed .
That was likely also true of some in the Roman congregation .
What should we ask ourselves about being “ obedient from the heart ” ?
To whatever extent that may be true in your case , what is your situation before God at this time ?
Think of the apostle Paul .
Nonetheless , he confessed that he was still guilty of sin .
Why do you want to be honest ?
Satan is “ the father of the lie . ”
Sadly , a person who makes it a point never to tell outright lies might still resort to deceiving others , dealing falsely with them .
There may have been a grain of truth in his mentioning a “ medical ” appointment , but would you say that he was being honest ?
He urged his brothers : “ Do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires . ”
What awaits those who prove their appreciation for God’s undeserved kindness ?
Or does it also speak to Christians who hope to live on earth ?
They receive “ the spirit ” as ones “ waiting for adoption as sons , the release from [ their fleshly ] bodies . ”
3 : 23 - 26 ; 4 : 25 ; 8 : 30 .
Accordingly , they can benefit from the counsel found in Romans chapter 8 that is given to righteous ones .
At Romans 8 : 21 , we find a guarantee that the new world will definitely come .
Do you have confidence that you will ?
( b ) At Romans 8 : 4 - 13 , in what sense did Paul use “ flesh ” ?
Sadly , any Christian could begin to walk according to the sinful flesh .
Recall , too , that for a time , a brother in Corinth was “ living with his father’s wife . ”
To what does Paul’s warning at Romans 8 : 6 not apply ?
Those are aspects of life for the average servant of God .
And Paul wrote about the proper place for passion or intimacy within marriage .
( See paragraphs 10 , 11 )
What sort of things might we include when asking ourselves , ‘ What is my key interest ? ’
It was fitting for Christians in Rome to analyze what their focus in life really was .
Could it be that their lives were dominated by or centered on “ things of the flesh ” ?
What is of greatest interest to us , and to what does our speech gravitate ?
For example , Jesus once made wine , and Paul told Timothy to take “ a little wine . ”
But did Jesus and Paul “ constantly talk about , engage and glory in ” wine ?
That is serious ​ — spiritual death now and physical death in the future .
Still , Paul did not mean that if someone began to ‘ set the mind on the flesh ’ his end unavoidably would be death .
Change is possible . Think of the immoral man in Corinth who went after “ the flesh ” and had to be disfellowshipped . Yet , he could and did change .
He ceased to walk after the flesh and returned to a straight path . ​ — 2 Cor .
2 : 6 - 8 .
Certainly , Paul’s warning about the possible final outcome for someone who ‘ sets his or her mind on the flesh ’ should be a stimulus to Christians to make any needed changes !
How can we gain that reward ?
Many married and enjoyed family life , working to support themselves . ​ — Mark 6 : 3 ; 1 Thess .
2 : 9 .
However , those servants of God did not allow such normal aspects of life to become the center of their lives .
( Read Acts 18 : 2 - 4 ; 20 : 20 , 21 , 34 , 35 . )
In what way does peace result from “ setting the mind on the spirit ” ?
One aspect of having such peace is that we strive to be at peace with those in our family and those in the congregation .
Why are you thankful for the counsel in Romans chapter 8 ?
Instead , we see the wisdom of living in line with the inspired assurance : “ Setting the mind on the spirit means life and peace . ”
Would you have tried to display a mild temper ?
In fact , God’s Word associates that disposition with wisdom .
Why are mild - tempered ones happy ?
By clothing themselves with mildness , many individuals who were once aggressive are now happy .
Adolfo , a circuit overseer in Spain , recalls what his life was like before he came into the truth .
Adolfo says he is happy for the changes he has been able to make .
And he is grateful to Jehovah for helping him to cultivate a mild temper .
Jehovah is , in effect , being taunted by his archenemy , the Devil .
If someone treats you harshly or unfairly , what can help you to keep your emotions in check and to react in a way that brings joy to Jehovah ?
Many people equate mildness with weakness .
They reason that to be strong , a person has to be assertive and aggressive .
“ By long forbearing and calmness of spirit a . . . ruler is persuaded , and soft speech breaks down the most bonelike resistance . ” ​ — Prov .
Questions for reflection :
How will a quick temper affect me ?
3 PRAY OFTEN .
Pray for holy spirit , the most powerful force in the universe .
“ Incessant prayer to Jehovah has been an invaluable help to me , particularly when situations have been tense , ” recalls Adolfo .
Jehovah will likewise answer our fervent pleas for holy spirit if we “ persevere in prayer . ” ​ — Rom .
12 : 12 .
1 : 5 .
What can you do to make Bible reading more beneficial ?
Is it wrong for a Christian to grieve even while believing in the resurrection ?
Faith in the resurrection does not eliminate the deep loss a Christian may feel .
Whom do the man with the secretary’s inkhorn , mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 9 , and the six men with weapons symbolize ?
It survived ( 1 ) the threat of decay of the materials used to write on , such as papyrus and parchment ; ( 2 ) opposition by political and religious leaders who tried to destroy it ; and ( 3 ) attempts by some to alter its message . ​ — wp16.4 , pp . 4 - 7 .
Identify your actual needs , and eliminate unnecessary expenses .

I tried to talk to the dead , visited graveyards with school friends , and watched horror movies with them .
We thought it was both exciting and frightening at the same time .
I started to go wayward when I was only ten years old .
Although I did not like the taste of it , I liked the effect of getting drunk .
I also loved music and dancing .
Mostly unaware of the extent of my wayward behavior , my mother was disappointed and angry .
We quarreled , and I ran away from home .
They were so kind and gentle , which I found very appealing .
So I agreed to study the Bible with them myself .
Also , I learned that God cared about me personally .
Jehovah’s Witnesses expressed genuine love toward me .
That was a big contrast to the treatment I had received at a local church .
I felt strengthened to keep trying hard and not give up .
It might be hard for us to imagine , but that man’s life stretched back for some 365 years ​ — more than four very long life spans by today’s standards !
Was this the end ?
Do you provide for a family ?
Have you ever faced the struggle of standing up for what you know to be right ?
If so , you may learn much from the faith of Enoch .
Mankind was in a bad way when Enoch came along .
That is why people still lived so long .
Yet , they were in a terrible condition morally and spiritually .
They were evidently using God’s sacred name in a blasphemous , disrespectful way . ​ — Genesis 4 : 8 , 23 - 26 .
That remarkable expression singles out Enoch as a godly man in a godless world .
So we see Enoch as a family man when he was about 65 years old .

He had a wife , unnamed in Scripture , and an unspecified number of “ sons and daughters . ”
With what result ?
The inspired record offers only tantalizing hints on that score .
Did Adam’s family mourn that profoundly selfish forefather ?
We do not know .
The day came when Jehovah communicated with this faithful servant of his .
That is a pattern that many prophecies thereafter followed .
The idea is this : The prophet is speaking of something that is so certain to occur that it may be described as if it has already happened ! ​ — Isaiah 46 : 10 .
Enoch fearlessly proclaimed God’s message to a hostile world
What was it like for Enoch to deliver that pronouncement , perhaps by preaching it to all who would hear ?
The judgment that Enoch bravely proclaimed still stands ; it applies to today’s world just as it did to the world of Enoch’s day .
Each of us needs to take Enoch’s warning to heart and share it with others .
How did the end come for Enoch ?
Just before his death , Enoch may have received a vision from God , perhaps one showing him the earth as a paradise .
Writing about Enoch and other faithful men and women , the apostle Paul stated : “ In faith all of these died . ”
Picture this scenario , remembering that it is only one possibility .
As he rested , he prayed to his God .
There was no trace of the hatred and religious persecution that Enoch knew only too well .
As for himself , Enoch sensed Jehovah’s assurance , love , and approval .
As Jesus later promised , the day will come when all those who are in God’s memory will hear Christ’s voice and come out of the grave , opening their eyes to a beautiful and peaceful new world . ​ — John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Some Bible scholars assert that Jude quoted an apocryphal work called the Book of Enoch , but that book is a fanciful work of uncertain origin , falsely attributed to Enoch .
Similarly , God likely ensured that the bodies of Moses and Jesus were beyond the reach of such abuses . ​ — Deuteronomy 34 : 5 , 6 ; Luke 24 : 3 - 6 ; Jude 9 .
A little girl saw smoke rising from factory smokestacks and expanding into what looked like puffy clouds .
Consider three common misunderstandings .
Some people misread these inspired words : “ There is an appointed time for everything , . . . a time for birth and a time to die . ”
Consider three reasons why the Bible is often misunderstood .
How would they receive it ?
Jesus explained : “ The helper , the holy spirit , which the Father will send in my name , that one will teach you all things . ”
The holy spirit also moves more knowledgeable Christians to come to the aid of those seeking greater understanding . ​ — Acts 8 : 26 - 35 .
For example , the prophet Daniel was told to write down a message for the future .
Eventually , people would correctly understand God’s prophecy written down by Daniel , but only at the particular time in history that God selected .
They believe that they thereby imitate Christ’s apostles , who humbly adjusted their thinking whenever Jesus corrected them . ​ — Acts 1 : 6 , 7 .
So seek help to understand what you are reading .
Yes
No
What the Bible says
Suffering and evil also often result from the bad choices people make . ​ — James 1 : 14 , 15 .
To learn why God allows suffering , see chapter 11 of this book , What Does the Bible Really Teach ? , published by Jehovah’s Witnesses

4 God’s Greatest Gift ​ — Why So Precious ?
16 WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ?
THE boat - shaped pencil sharpener in Jordan’s hand seems unremarkable .
* And how should we respond to it ?


What makes a gift truly precious to you ?
Some gifts are precious because they were given to us by someone in authority or someone whom we highly esteem .
Other gifts , though of little monetary value , are cherished because they come from a dear family member or a trusted friend .
In addition , he loyally cares for us as a devoted father cares for his children .
Addressing some of his ancient people as Ephraim , God asked : “ Is Ephraim not a precious son to me , a beloved child ? . . .
A truly unselfish giver does not expect to be repaid for his kindness .
“ By this the love of God was revealed in our case , that God sent his only - begotten Son , ” says the Bible .
To what end ?
Some gifts are precious because they represent a great sacrifice made by the giver .
Never has a closer bond existed between two intelligent beings .
That gift would be priceless indeed , would it not ?
As descendants of Adam , we are all “ dying , ” unable to escape the stings of sickness and death or to reconcile ourselves to God and be free of guilt before him .
Yes , faith in the shed blood of Jesus opens the door to forgiveness of sin and to everlasting life .
For more information about God’s purpose to resurrect the dead , see chapter 7 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
“ The love the Christ has compels us . . .
He died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves , but for him who died for them . ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 14 , 15 .
AN EXTRAORDINARY gift should compel us to express gratitude .
Jesus highlighted that lesson after he healed ten men of a debilitating disease that had no cure at the time .
Rather , Jesus said in prayer to God : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ”
If someone told you that a man saved your life when you were yet a child , would you not be interested in learning more about that man and why he saved you ?
Jehovah God , who gave the lifesaving gift of the ransom , wants you not only to know who he is but also to come into a close relationship with him .
We warmly invite you to join us in response to God’s greatest gift .
Slave trade between Africa and the Americas was a lucrative business
Blessing was expected to earn 200 to 300 euros a night to pay off a debt that her madam had set at over 40,000 euros .
* “ I often thought about escaping , ” Blessing explains , “ but I was afraid of what they would do to my family .
But when he rejected the advances of his master’s wife , he found himself unjustly accused of attempted rape .
He was thrown into jail and put in irons . ​ — Genesis 39 : 1 - 20 ; Psalm 105 : 17 , 18 .
As time went on , slavery did not get kinder .
From the 16th century to the 19th century , the slave trade between Africa and the Americas was one of the most lucrative businesses on earth .
Hundreds of thousands are said to have died during the Atlantic crossing .
In the 18th century , slaves on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola rose up against their masters .
They certainly deserved their freedom .
The Israelites ’ release from their unjust treatment in Egypt was unique because God himself intervened .
To this day , Jews everywhere celebrate the Passover each year to commemorate that event . ​ — Exodus 12 : 14 .
“ With Jehovah our God there is no injustice , ” says the Bible , and it assures us that he has not changed .
Actually , God did help Joseph and Blessing to escape from slavery in different ways .
Determined to straighten out her life , she got a regular job and convinced her former madam to lower the monthly debt payments .
One day , Blessing got a phone call from the madam .
“ To pay for my drug habit , I turned to crime and became a drug trafficker , ” Alonso confesses .
Or more likely , I would probably be dead . ”
To answer that question , let us consider the origin and development of this practice as well as God’s view of it .
Along the same line , the apostle Paul spoke about Christians who chose to follow his example of singleness “ for the sake of the good news . ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 7 : 37 , 38 ; 9 : 23 .
In addition , the Bible shows that many Christian ministers in the first century , including the apostle Peter , were married men .
These were not celibate marriages , for the Bible candidly states that a “ husband [ ought to ] give to his wife her due ” and that married couples should “ not deprive each other ” of sexual intimacies .
My faith and my relationship with God are strengthened when I see how he takes care of me . ”

“ THE bus can leave , but the Chinese guy stays ! ”
The man said that he was a legal resident but had been robbed of his documents and money .
She gave the man some Bible literature and urged him to study the Bible with the Witnesses .
Let us see in what ways this is so .
Paul was not saying that they gave because they were happy .
Thank you for making it possible for me to make this gift ​ — it gives me comfort . ”
Giving , of course , is not limited to money .
This approach to life benefits them in various ways , not the least of which is that such generosity is good for their health .
Jesus urged his followers : “ Practice giving , and people will give to you . They will pour into your laps a fine measure , pressed down , shaken together , and overflowing .
Giving thus fosters cooperation and friendship .
Researchers who study human relations have noted that “ people who consistently display altruism encourage others to follow suit . ”
Hence , according to one study , “ each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people , some of whom he or she does not know and has not met . ”
Yes , great benefits would come if more people practiced giving .
A remarkable finding from scientific research is that “ there appears to be a fundamental human drive toward helping others . ”
Moreover , the man acted on Alexandra’s suggestion and began studying the Bible .
She was delighted to meet him again three months later at a Chinese - language convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Peru .
Giving and helping others bring great joy .
Look under PUBLICATIONS > BOOKS & BROCHURES .
Bible prophecy , combined with current events , identifies our time as “ the last days . ”
The last days would be marked by wars , famines , earthquakes , and epidemics of deadly disease . ​ — Matthew 24 : 3 , 7 ; Luke 21 : 11 .
What do you think ?
“ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 29 .
What else can we learn from the Bible ?
The last days will end with the removal of all wickedness . ​ — 1 John 2 : 17 .
The earth will be transformed into a paradise . ​ — Isaiah 35 : 1 , 6 .

10 THE BIBLE CHANGES LIVES
The ride of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse is one of the best - known scenes from the book of Revelation .
Others are intrigued .
“ Happy is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy . ” ​ — Revelation 1 : 3 .
This issue of The Watchtower explains how the ride of the four horsemen can mean good news for us .
The first horse is white ​ — its rider a glorious , newly crowned king .
Or do you feel the way Ed did ?
And although their ride has signaled calamity on earth , it can also mean good news for you and your family .
Clearly , he has authority to act as a warrior - king , and he does not wield his power in any corrupt or abusive way .
* Thus , it is Almighty God who grants Jesus the power and right to rule and execute judgment .
Note that the first rider , Jesus , begins his ride when he receives a crown .
Confined here , Satan has been full of rage ever since , knowing that his days are numbered .
Now , let us see how the other three horsemen help to confirm that we are , in fact , living during the troubled “ last days . ”
It was followed by a second world war , which was even more destructive .
Even so - called peacekeeping organizations , such as the United Nations , have not been able to stop the rider of the red horse . “ I saw , and look !
And the Grave was closely following him .
But the Spanish flu was just the beginning .
The Grave relentlessly gathers up the victims , offering no hope .
Soon , during Armageddon , Jesus will remove Satan’s influence and will destroy the Devil’s human supporters .
Jehovah “ is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth . He breaks the bow and shatters the spear . ”
As for peace - loving people , “ they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 11 .
Instead of famine , there will be plenty of food .
Jesus will soon reverse the effects of the other three horsemen
God “ will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 4 .
Revelation 6 : 5 , 6
The rider denotes famine .
Revelation 6 : 7 , 8
In 2014 an article in the magazine Biblical Archaeology Review addressed the question : “ How many people in the Hebrew Bible have been confirmed archaeologically ? ”
Let us review his brief role in the Bible record .
So Tattenai was ordered not to interfere , and he obeyed . ​ — Ezra 6 : 6 , 7 , 13 .
To be sure , “ Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River ” merits only a footnote in history .
I grew up in and around Puerto Limón , a port city on the eastern coast of Costa Rica .
Thereafter , my mother raised us children as a single parent .
So I turned down that offer .
I also gambled on domino games and played the lottery .
While I was living that way , my mother became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
I also learned that true Christians do not carry out their ministry for financial gain .
As I studied the Bible , I compared what it says with what I saw among Jehovah’s Witnesses .
It took me some time , however , to follow through decisively .
The first Sunday after I quit playing the lottery , my “ lucky ” number won !
People mocked me because I did not play that week , and they strongly pressured me to play again , but I didn’t .
That evening , I returned to the hotel where I was staying and found my ex - girlfriend waiting outside the door to my room .
I feel as if I could write a book about the benefits I have received from following the Bible’s guidance !
Some of those benefits are that I now have many genuine friends , a life full of purpose , and true happiness .
Picture a Middle Eastern woman with a striking pair of dark , expressive eyes .
She and her beloved husband , Abraham , had spent countless happy hours here .
They lived in Ur , a prosperous city with plenty of artisans , craftsmen , and merchants .
Though perhaps about 60 years old , she would travel to parts unknown and take up a life fraught with danger and hardship , with no prospect of coming back .
And what can we today learn from her faith ?
They surely remembered her too , for she was an extraordinarily beautiful woman .
Sarah is known in the Bible for her great faith ​ — but it was not faith in the moon - god widely worshipped in Ur , where a tower to that god loomed over the city .
Their fatherless nephew Lot evidently became like a son to them .
But the Bible urges us to make another choice ​ — to seek spiritual things first , to put pleasing God ahead of pleasing ourselves .
As we contemplate what Sarah did , we might ask ourselves , ‘ What choice will I make in life ? ’
Some of those houses had over a dozen rooms , as well as freshwater fountains and plumbing .
Terah , as family patriarch , was to accompany Abraham and Sarah , though he was about two centuries old .
Sarah would no doubt have much to do with caring for this elderly parent .
In this instance , though , God added a thrilling promise : “ I will make you a great nation . ”
But when they left Haran , Abraham was 75 and Sarah 65 , and they were childless .
Ah , this expression , “ offspring , ” would have rich meaning for Abraham !
So he spoke to Sarah : “ Please listen ! I know what a beautiful woman you are .
Abraham and Sarah knew that nothing was more important than God’s purpose to produce a special offspring and nation through Abraham , so Abraham’s safety became of paramount importance .
So Abraham acted wisely , and Sarah humbly cooperated with his decision .
Perhaps Pharaoh planned to woo her and impress her with his wealth and then negotiate with her “ brother ” to obtain her as a wife . ​ — Genesis 12 : 14 - 16 .
Think of Sarah , looking out over the Egyptian landscape from a palace window or balcony .
If only every married person in today’s immoral world would show such loyalty !
Can you imitate Sarah’s loyalty in your dealings with your own loved ones and friends ?
If we put spiritual things ahead of material things , try to share our knowledge of God with others , and loyally uphold God’s moral standards in the face of temptations , we will imitate the faith of Sarah .
“ God is not partial , but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him . ”
In God’s view , all people are equal .
It promotes faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now ruling as King of God’s Kingdom .
3 A Puzzling Question
4 What the Bible Says About Life and Death
8 WHEN A LOVED ONE IS TERMINALLY ILL
13 A POWERFUL REASSURANCE FROM HEBREW’S SMALLEST LETTER
Followers of nearly all major religions believe that the human soul is immortal
VIEWS about life and death are many and varied .
Some feel that after death they will live on , perhaps in another form or in another place .
Still others think that death simply ends it all .
To many , death is therefore an important step in the cycle of life , and dying appears to them to be part of God’s will .
Reading the creation account in the Bible book of Genesis , we learn that the first man , Adam , was told by God : “ From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction .
That statement clearly and simply shows that if Adam had obeyed God’s command , he would not have died but would have continued living in the garden of Eden .
The consequences of that act of disobedience are still with us today .
That “ one man ” was , of course , Adam .
But what was the sin , and why did it lead to death ?
What Adam did ​ — willfully disobeying or breaking God’s law — ​ is sin .
You will not find any Bible text that uses the expression “ immortal soul ”
In the first century , the apostle Paul sounded this warning : “ The inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons . ”
How true those words proved to be !
Our Creator did not intend for humans to live just 70 or 80 years on earth and then move on to spend an eternity in another realm .
His original purpose was for his human creation to live forever right here on earth as his obedient children .
Reassuringly , the inspired psalmist declared : “ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 29 .
For example , a book on the subject is said to delve into “ the multitude of cutting - edge scientific developments ” in that field .
Researchers believe that some plants of this species of seagrass have lived for thousands of years
Consider the following :
Still , its content is harmonious and coherent throughout .
Early and open communication is vital
Sadly , Doreen’s reaction is not uncommon .
Commendably , many willingly take on the task of caring for a loved one who is diagnosed with a terminal illness .
Diseases that would have ended a person’s life quickly in times past may now stretch out over many years .
Consequently , more and more , death has moved from the home to the hospital .
Yes , pray earnestly for Jehovah God to show you how to ‘ count your days ’ wisely so that you can use the remaining days with your loved one in the best possible way .
This takes good planning .
Frank discussion about whether he wishes to be resuscitated , hospitalized , or submitted to certain treatments can minimize misunderstandings and feelings of guilt on the part of family members who are forced to make decisions for an incapacitated patient .
The Bible relates that on one occasion , the apostle Paul and his companions were under extreme pressure and were very uncertain even of their lives .
Caregivers and family may need to be assured that their dear one’s trial is over and that he is no longer suffering .
Death , where is your sting ? ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 55 .
Identify yourself by name , and listen with respect even if the person seems confused .
A moaning sound while exhaling may merely be air passing over relaxed vocal chords .
Probably not .
To the untrained eye , הנפשׁ ( han·ne’phesh ) could appear to be a totally different word from נפשׁ ( ne’phesh ) .
He printed the root of each word in solid letters .
This edition was published in Nuremberg in 1599 and is often referred to as the Nuremberg Polyglot .
Evidently , scholars had previously produced Hebrew translations of the New Testament .
One such was Simon Atoumanos , a Byzantine monk , in about 1360 .
Another was Oswald Schreckenfuchs , a German scholar , in about 1565 .
Jesus was saying that it was more likely that heaven and earth would pass away than that the smallest detail of the Law would go unfulfilled .
Yet the Scriptures assure us that the literal heavens and earth will remain forever .
Consider this : The ancient Israelites were told that they must not break any bone of the Passover lamb . A small detail , perhaps .
Probably not .
Jehovah God knew , though , that this detail was prophetic of the fact that the Messiah would not have any of his bones broken when put to death on the torture stake . ​ — Psalm 34 : 20 ; John 19 : 31 - 33 , 36 .
We cannot help but wonder : ‘ Is “ paradise ” nothing more than a pleasant fantasy ?
The account tells us : “ Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food . ”
In the 15th century , Italian navigator Christopher Columbus wondered if he was close to rediscovering the Edenic garden when he landed on the island of Hispaniola , now the Dominican Republic and Haiti .
At its top is a small rectangle with paradise in the center .
From there flow four rivers , labeled “ Tigris , ” “ Eufrates , ” “ Pison , ” and “ Geon , ” each to one of its four corners , supposedly representing the spread of Christianity to the four corners of the earth .
Most churchgoers are taught that their ultimate destiny is heaven , not life in an earthly paradise .

Because the Bible tells us : “ As for the heavens , they belong to Jehovah , but the earth he has given to the sons of men . ”
The hope of Paradise on earth is one that “ God , who cannot lie , promised long ago . ”
What a wonderful prospect the Bible offers ​ — Paradise forever ! It is also interesting that the Koran , in verse 105 of sura 21 , Al - Anbiya ’ [ The Prophets ] , declares : “ The righteous among My servants shall inherit the earth . ”

What the Bible says
By prayer , you can gain “ the peace of God , ” which alleviates anxiety . ​ — Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
Additionally , reading God’s Word can help you to cope with stress . ​ — Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 .

3 Angels ​ — Can They Affect Your Life ?
4 The Truth About Angels
12 IMITATE THEIR FAITH | SARAH
So Kenneth and Filomena kindly asked her what was wrong .
The woman explained that she had planned to kill herself that very afternoon , and she was writing a suicide note to her husband when Kenneth’s phone call stopped her .
“ We thanked Jehovah for letting us help this distraught lady , ” says Kenneth , “ and especially for moving us ​ — perhaps by an angel or by His holy spirit — ​ to make that phone call ! ”
*
We cannot say for sure .
For example , the Bible says that God used an angel to direct the Christian evangelizer Philip to help an Ethiopian official who was looking for spiritual guidance . ​ — Acts 8 : 26 - 31 .
What is the truth about angels ?
What does the Bible tell us ?
The loyal angels reside in the heavens and have direct access to God’s heavenly presence . ​ — Luke 24 : 39 ; Matthew 18 : 10 ; John 4 : 24 .
Moreover , angels did not first come into existence as humans on earth ​ — whether as babies , children , or adults .
Angels are “ mighty in power ” ​ — much more powerful than humans — ​ and they have superhuman intelligence .
Sadly , some angels chose to rebel against God . ​ — Jude 6 .
They are often shown to be in attendance upon him . ​ — Genesis 3 : 24 ; Ezekiel 9 : 3 ; 11 : 22 .
The myriads of other angelic messengers serve as the Most High’s agents and deputies in carrying out the divine will .
Hence , true worshippers do not take unwise and careless risks , presuming that God’s angels will protect them .
Kenneth , mentioned in the opening article , is one who feels that way .
Though we cannot be dogmatic , he may be correct .
Jehovah’s Witnesses frequently see evidence of angelic intervention as they engage in their preaching work .
Recall that God created angels with the gift of free will .
Sadly , the ungodly rebellion did not end there .
The Bible teaches that God’s Messianic Kingdom , a heavenly government , was established in 1914 .
However , the increase in depravity and shocking violence confirm that the end of their reign of terror is near .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
However , regarding our time , Jesus said : “ This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations , and then the end will come . ”
Then angelic “ armies in heaven ” will support Jesus Christ , the King of kings , in fighting “ the war of the great day of God the Almighty ” at Armageddon .
Powerful angels will serve as executioners of divine judgment as the Lord Jesus “ brings vengeance on those who . . . do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus . ” ​ — 2 Thessalonians 1 : 7 , 8 .
Be assured , therefore , that the angels are personally interested in you .

Under the Mosaic Law , dogs were deemed to be unclean animals .
But did Jesus mean to insult this Greek woman and other non - Jews ?
The atmosphere at home was warm and loving , and my parents taught me sound moral values .
When I was 14 years old , I spent a lot of time working on an environmental project to recycle wastepaper .
Anxiety gripped me .
One evening at the academy , I sat with a group of students discussing the future .
Mandy * was a student and also one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
That evening she pointed me in the right direction .
I felt both skeptical and curious , but curiosity won the day .
But who wrote those prophecies , and who could predict the future so accurately ?
Psalm 37 : 9 states : “ Those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth . ”
It appealed to me that this prospect is open to all individuals who endeavor to live up to God’s standards of conduct as explained in the Bible .
Moreover , it was not easy for me to abandon a morally loose lifestyle .
I am no longer fearful of life and anxious about the future .
SARAH straightened up from her work and turned toward the horizon .
She had watched Abraham * leave in the morning , and she gazed expectantly in the same direction .

Yet , if we imagine Sarah gazing sadly to the east , pining for the comforts of her childhood home , we do not know this godly woman .
And they would surely have faded from human memory instead of becoming inspiring examples of faith that have touched millions of hearts .
Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children . ”
Does the account suggest that Jehovah moved Sarah to make such an offer ?
And what an amazing message they received !
He changed her name from Sarai , which may have meant something like “ Contentious , ” to Sarah , the name familiar to us all .
Jehovah explained why he chose that name for this beloved woman : “ I will bless her and also give you a son by her ; I will bless her and she will become nations ; kings of peoples will come from her . ” ​ — Genesis 17 : 5 , 15 , 16 .
Jehovah’s covenant to bring forth an offspring who would bless all nations would be fulfilled through Sarah’s son !
The apostle Paul likely had this incident in mind when he wrote : “ Do not forget hospitality , for through it some unknowingly entertained angels . ”
When one of the angels repeated to Abraham God’s promise about Sarah giving birth to a son , she was out of sight , within her tent , listening .
The angel corrected Sarah with the pointed question , “ Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah ? ”
She bore a son to her beloved husband , now a century old !
The apostle Paul was later inspired to call Ishmael’s behavior persecution .
However , Jehovah saw the matter clearly , so he intervened .
What the Bible says
God promises to eliminate suffering and injustice , “ making all things new . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 4 , 5 .
We can gain inner peace by caring for our “ spiritual need . ” ​ — Matthew 5 : 3 .
Is It Necessary to Belong to an Organized Religion ?
This publication is not for sale .
It comforts people with the good news that God’s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise .
It adheres to the Bible as its authority .
Who is the greatest gift - giver in the universe ?
Each year , many people spend time and effort searching for that “ best ” gift for a friend or a relative on a special occasion .
And most would love to hear a response like those mentioned at the outset .
That prospect can be very appealing , not only because of the effect a gift can have on the receiver but also because of the way it can make the giver feel .
After all , the value of the gift will be determined by the receiver .
And what one recipient considers best might not be so for another .
In some cultures , the preferred gift for young and old alike is money , allowing the receiver to use it for whatever he or she wants .
While finding such a gift may not always be possible , keeping in mind certain factors would likely increase the chances for success .
The recipient’s desires .
A man in Belfast , Northern Ireland , called a racing bike he received when he was 10 or 11 years old the best present ever .
The Bible encourages us to “ be quick to listen , slow to speak . ”
However , for many gift - givers , this takes away part of the joy of giving , as they much prefer to surprise the receiver with just the right gift .
Then give thought to what gifts may address a need the person has .
To gain insight into the needs of the intended recipient of your gift , consult with others who have been in similar circumstances .
The Bible states : “ A word spoken at the right time ​ — how good it is ! ”
Just as words spoken at the right time can be very pleasing to the hearer , a gift given at the right time or on the appropriate occasion can contribute greatly to the receiver’s happiness .
A youth is soon to graduate from school .
*
Of course , you need not limit gift - giving to special occasions .
However , a word of caution might be in order .
The giver’s motives .
“ God loves a cheerful giver , ” Paul told them . ​ — 2 Corinthians 9 : 7 .
These factors ​ — and more — ​ have played a part in God’s arrangement for mankind to receive the greatest gift of all .
“ Every good gift and every perfect present is from above , coming down from the Father of the celestial lights . ”
Jesus ’ well - known words , recorded at John 3 : 16 , tell us : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Try as we may , on our own there is nothing we can do to be released from that bondage .
Why is it necessary ?
Sadly , they forfeited all of that by choosing to disobey God ​ — thus becoming sinners .
In view of what it accomplishes , there is no doubt that God’s gift of the ransom , which makes everlasting life possible , is the greatest gift of all .
Satisfies our desire .
The Bible says : “ For the wages sin pays is death , but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” ​ — Romans 6 : 23 .
But “ through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus , ” God has provided just what is needed . ​ — Romans 3 : 23 , 24 .
The Bible tells us : “ While we were yet sinners , Christ died for us . ”
We are confident that as you learn about and benefit from this greatest gift , you will be moved to exclaim : “ Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! ” ​ — Romans 7 : 25 .
He never posed for a portrait or a sculpture .
One way is to examine statements in the Bible that can shed some light on what he might have looked like .
Those are words that Jesus uttered in prayer apparently at the time of his baptism .
What did that body look like ?
Some 30 years earlier , the angel Gabriel had revealed to Mary : “ You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , . . .
God’s Son . ”
Only those set aside as Nazirites , such as Samson , did not cut their hair . ​ — Numbers 6 : 5 ; Judges 13 : 5 .
It took extraordinary stamina to travel throughout Palestine on foot and declare this message .
Unlike them , Jesus instructed his apostles not to “ lord it over ” others .
So while many details are unknown , it is evident that Jesus did not look the way he has often been portrayed .
He gave his life as “ a ransom in exchange for many . ”
Over 60 years after Jesus ’ death , the beloved apostle John saw visions of Jesus .
Don and Margaret * enjoyed the visit of their daughter and her family .
For their parting meal together , Margaret , a retired professional cook , prepared macaroni and cheese , a favorite meal of her two grandsons .
She raised the lid and to her dismay discovered that there was just hot cheese sauce in the bowl !
When we do something well , we gladly accept the praise and acknowledgment that we feel we deserve .
To do so requires humility .
Have you done something wrong and caused inconvenience or worse to yourself or somebody else ?
To insist that the fault lies elsewhere will almost certainly prolong unnecessary tension and allow the problem to intensify .
Instead , learn , correct , and move on .
Do your best to promote a spirit of peace and cooperation .

Appreciating that others are also dealing with their mistakes will draw us closer to them .
Most important , we can benefit from learning to imitate God’s love and his willingness to forgive freely . ​ — Colossians 3 : 13 .
Not at all .
They wrote mostly in Hebrew , so we call this section the Hebrew Scriptures , also known as the Old Testament .
God inspired faithful disciples of Jesus Christ to write these books over a much shorter time ​ — about 60 years from about 41 C.E . to 98 C.E .
But why were additional translations of the Bible made ?
About 300 years before Jesus ’ day , Jewish scholars began to translate the Hebrew Scriptures into another language ​ — Greek .
Why was it made ?
Bruce . As Jesus ’ disciples progressively received the books of the Christian Greek Scriptures , they put them together with the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures , and that came to be the complete Bible that we have today .
Today , Bible scholars are in a better position than ever to review older translations .
They have a much clearer understanding of ancient Bible languages , and they have valuable ancient Bible manuscripts that have been found in recent times .
These help to establish more accurately the original text of the Bible .
So there is real value in new Bible versions .
Of course , there is need for caution regarding some of them .
One reason for doing this , some translators say , is that God’s personal name , represented by the Tetragrammaton ( YHWH ) , never appeared in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures .
Jewish copyists made the fewest mistakes .
A History of the Bible .
“ Anxious believers can be enormously reassured by the almost exact similarity between even the earliest of the biblical papyri from Egypt and the text as it has survived during its descent through countless scriptoria and printing shops of Europe . ” ​ — The Book .
And are you aware of what the Bible has to say about birthdays ?
First , the Bible does not mention birthday celebrations for Jesus or any other faithful worshipper of God .
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica , the early Christians opposed the “ pagan custom of celebrating birthdays . ”
The Bible does not say exactly when Jesus was born .
Thus , McClintock and Strong note that “ the observance of Christmas is not of divine appointment , nor is it of N [ ew ] T [ estament ] origin . ”
Celebrating Christmas , however , is not one of them .
Just as a schoolteacher does not want his students to go beyond the instructions given them , Jesus does not want his followers to “ go beyond the things that are written ” in the Holy Scriptures . ​ — 1 Corinthians 4 : 6 .
These specific instructions , as well as the calendar day of his death , are recorded in the Bible . ​ — Luke 22 : 19 ; 1 Corinthians 11 : 25 .
As we have seen , Christmas is a birthday celebration , and early Christians did not follow that pagan custom .
In light of these facts , millions of Christians the world over have concluded that Christmas is not for them .
God fights the war of Armageddon , not to ruin the earth , but to save it from ruin by humankind . ​ — Revelation 11 : 18 .
The war of Armageddon will end all wars . ​ — Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 .
Yes
“ A great crowd ” of people from all nations will survive “ the great tribulation , ” which will end with the war of Armageddon . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 14 .
He destroys the wicked only as a last resort . ​ — Ezekiel 18 : 32 .

27 “ These Things Entrust to Faithful Men ”
As one generation replaces another , younger ones take on the work of older ones .
What have they learned from serving abroad ?
Anita , now in her mid - 70 ’ s , had serious doubts about her abilities .
She grew up in England , where she began pioneering when she was 18 years old .
But I thought , ‘ If Jehovah thinks I can do it , I will try . ’
Today , while caring for her mother in Canada , Maureen still serves as a special pioneer .
“ Seeing how groups and congregations are being formed in remote regions is my greatest joy , ” she says .
“ To have had a small part in Jehovah’s work on these islands is a privilege beyond words . ”
I fervently prayed to Jehovah to help me to act . ”
Often , when I share the Bible’s message in the home of a family , five or six neighbors come over to listen .
That’s what I did , and what a blessing it was !
I gained spiritual mothers and fathers , brothers and sisters , just as Jesus promised . ” ​ — Mark 10 : 29 , 30 .
Anne , now in her mid - 40 ’ s , serves in Asia in a land where our work is restricted .
Ute
Heidi
Some of my former Bible students are now pioneers and congregation elders .
And what a blessing it is now to have dear friends all over the world !
Above all , rely on Jehovah .
Noah ?
other faithful servants of Jehovah ?
Jehovah created humans with what remarkable abilities ?
Jehovah expects us to put our abilities to good use .
In the Christian Greek Scriptures , we are told : “ As long as we have the opportunity , let us work what is good toward all ” ; and “ to the extent that each one has received a gift , use it in ministering to one another . ”
Clearly , Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others .
And no matter how much knowledge or experience we gain , we will always be like children in comparison with Jehovah . ​ — Isa .
At the same time , we should do what we can , taking appropriate action to solve problems and help others .
In short , we need both ‘ to trust in Jehovah and to do what is good ’ ; we need ‘ to act with faithfulness . ’
He knew that Jehovah would eventually bring an end to that wicked world .
( b ) How are we in a situation similar to Noah’s ?
And we cannot do anything to speed up the start of the “ great tribulation . ”
( See opening picture . )
No doubt , doing so helped Noah keep his faith strong .
Such work may include the construction and maintenance of facilities for worship , volunteering to assist at assemblies and conventions , or caring for assignments at a branch office or a remote translation office .
What David could not do : David could not undo what he had done .
Thus , he needed faith .
11 : 32 - 34 .
What can we learn from David’s example ?
We must confess our sins to him .
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
And we do what is within our power to benefit from Christian meetings and other spiritual provisions . ​ — Heb .
At the same time , such parents work hard to remain loyal to Jehovah , hoping that their example will move their children to return to the fold .
And there was likely little she could do to improve her financial situation .
Many of our modern - day fellow believers have similarly demonstrated trust in Jehovah and have taken appropriate action .
Malcolm’s advice ?
( b ) How will you apply the 2017 yeartext in your life ?
So it is more important than ever that we do not allow ourselves to be paralyzed by such challenges .
“ Where the spirit of Jehovah is , there is freedom . ” ​ — 2 COR .
That is easier . ”
How do you view the matter of free will ?
Does it have limitations ?
How does the way we use our freedom of choice reveal the depth of our love for Jehovah ?
This was not an arbitrary choice .
Jehovah was being true to a promise that he had made centuries earlier to his friend Abraham .
4 , 5 . ( a ) Who was the first to receive God’s gift of free will , and how did he use it ?
When Jehovah began his creative works , he lovingly chose to bestow free will on his intelligent creatures .
The first one to receive this gift was his firstborn Son , “ the image of the invisible God . ”
Later , when Jesus was on earth , he exercised his free will to reject the temptations of the great Adversary .
We do not have the absolute freedom that Jehovah has .
When creating the first human , Adam , God gave him the same gift he had given his intelligent creatures in heaven , the gift of free will .
However , Jehovah reserved the joy of naming those creatures for his first human son .
God “ began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one . ”
After Adam observed each animal and assigned it a suitable name , Jehovah did not step in and override Adam’s choices .
This gross misuse of free will resulted in millenniums of suffering and pain for Adam’s descendants .
Sadly , in time the nation misused its freedom of choice and broke that promise .
Let us heed this warning example and always treasure our gift of free will by continuing to stick close to Jehovah and obeying his righteous requirements . ​ — 1 Cor .
Abraham and Sarah willingly followed God’s leadings to a land of promise .
May we imitate the faith of such ancient ones by treasuring our gift of free will and using it to do God’s will .
( Read . )
In verse 20 we learn that Jehovah gave them the precious opportunity to show him what was in their hearts .
What must we never do with our gift of free will ?
What is one way we can avoid misusing our Christian freedom ?
Instead of using our freedom “ as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires , ” we want to be determined to make choices that help us to heed the admonition : “ Do all things for God’s glory . ” ​ — Gal .
What do we learn from the principle found at Galatians 6 : 5 ?
Since we all have the gift of free will , no two Christians will always make exactly the same decision . This is true even in matters that involve our conduct and worship .
Next , he warned them not to allow their “ right to choose ” to become “ a stumbling block to those who [ were ] weak . ”
10 : 32 , 33 .
Regarding the account in question , at least one commentator believes that a flame could “ scarcely have been kept going throughout the long journey ” that Abraham and Isaac made .
Glowing embers transported in such a way could readily be used with tinder wood to rekindle a fire at any point along a journey .

How is modesty related to humility ?
How can we flourish in our assigned place ?
( See opening picture . )
KING SAUL of ancient Israel began his reign as a modest and respected man .
Instead of accepting the correction , Saul made excuses , tried to shift the blame , and minimized what he had done .
( b ) What questions need to be answered ?
In doing so , they may sacrifice all modesty .
Why , though , does modesty still matter ?
And how can we remain modest despite challenging situations or pressure from others ?
( Read Proverbs 11 : 2 . )
But as King Saul’s example illustrates , if we develop a pattern of pushing ahead , sooner or later we will find ourselves in serious trouble with God .
Psalm 119 : 21 says of Jehovah : “ You rebuke the presumptuous . ”
Second , if we act beyond the scope of our authority , we are likely to get into conflict with others .
As the Scriptures show , modesty is always the right course .
6 , 7 .
We might be drawing attention to ourselves in inappropriate ways .
Selfish ambition , envy , and uncontrolled anger have led many to presumptuous acts .
15 : 1 - 6 ; 18 : 9 - 17 ; 2 Chron .
How is modesty related to acknowledging our place in God’s arrangement ?
( See paragraphs 12 - 14 )
After his sacrificial death , Jesus returned to heavenly spirit life to become the King of God’s Kingdom in 1914 .
15 : 28 .
6 : 10 .
He does not worry about gaining future privileges or about what others are achieving .
Modesty helps us to enjoy giving others due honor and support . ​ — Rom .
What can we learn from Gideon’s modesty ?
Gideon was bold and courageous .
He did not seize upon his assignment to gain prominence .
16 , 17 .
Does this always require a change of assignment though ?
For example , will he be able to take on more work or responsibility without neglecting other important things ?
Can some of his current work be delegated to make room for the new responsibility ?
Modesty may lead us to say no .
( b ) How does Romans 12 : 3 apply to a modest person ?
So any time we take on new responsibilities , we need to reflect prayerfully on whatever Jehovah tells us through his Word and his organization .
Modesty restrains us from acting dishonorably , and it promotes unity among Jehovah’s people .
But what about when we are under pressure ?
cope with criticism or praise ?
But it could be that he completely forgot that he was supposed to be ‘ walking modestly with God . ’
A modest person is keenly aware that he can and must be in constant communication with his loving and almighty Father .
In the preceding article , we learned why modesty is still important for Christians and what displaying it involves .
What situations , though , might put our modesty to the test ?
5 , 6 .
Changes in personal circumstances or of assignments can test our modesty .
So Barzillai recommended that Chimham , presumably one of his sons , take his place . ​ — 2 Sam .
Modesty helped Barzillai to make a reasonable decision .
He simply recognized and accepted his changing circumstances and his limitations . He did not want to take on more than he reasonably could .
If we focus on position , prominence , or recognition , it only provides a breeding ground for egotism , competition , and eventual disappointment .
Modesty , however , helps all to focus their collective abilities and efforts on bringing glory to God and doing what is best to help others . ​ — 1 Cor .
He continually sought Jehovah’s direction by consulting God’s Law .
Nehemiah did not domineer over others ; rather , he served them at his own expense . ​ — Neh .
A modest person will always remember his place before God and his role in God’s arrangement .
Especially when we are faced with a familiar situation or problem , we have to be careful not to rely on ourselves .
Later , when she was praying at the tabernacle , High Priest Eli mistakenly accused her of being drunk .
It is full of expressions of faith , praise , and appreciation . ​ — 1 Sam .
A modest person will imitate Jesus .
“ When he was being insulted , ” the Bible says , “ he did not insult in return . . . , but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously . ”
Jesus knew that vengeance belongs to Jehovah .
Christians are likewise admonished to be humble and not to “ pay back injury for injury . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
She did not become vain or immodest even after the king selected her to be his queen . ​ — Esther 2 : 9 , 12 , 15 , 17 .
Does our dress and grooming show respect for Jehovah and others , or does it show a lack of modesty ?
We realize that we win people’s hearts , not by boasting or drawing undue attention to ourselves , but by displaying a “ quiet and mild spirit . ”
9 : 23 , 24 ) Vain sentiments in our hearts will eventually show up in our actions .
How will we look after ourselves in our old age ?
5 : 6 .
The apostle Paul wrote that Jehovah surrounded the less honorable parts of the human body “ with greater honor . ”
Instead of seeking the spotlight or always stepping in to take over , we will more often find ourselves modestly seeking the advice of others and yielding to their suggestions .
We will rejoice with them when they receive privileges .
5 : 9 .
How can we train our conscience to have a godly sense of decency ?
Through regular study , prayer , and application of what we learn , we can gradually strengthen our conscience .
Cherish that honor , and continue to do your best to walk modestly with Jehovah forever .
How can younger men demonstrate a proper attitude as they take on the work of older brothers ?
1 , 2 .
First , how can older ones help younger ones take on increased responsibility , and why is this important ?
After residing for years as a fugitive , David became king and lived in a comfortable house .
Dismayed that there was no “ house , ” or temple , dedicated to Jehovah , he wanted to build one .
He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in . ”
How did David react to Jehovah’s direction ?
22 : 11 , 14 - 16 .
After all , the temple was to be “ exceedingly magnificent , ” and Solomon was at the time “ young and inexperienced . ”
Illustrate .
When the boy is older , the father explains what he is doing . Then , when the boy is of legal age , he begins to drive the car as his father gives him further instruction .
Sometimes they may take turns driving , but eventually the son may do most , if not all , of the driving for his aging father .
The wise father is pleased to have his son take over and does not feel that he has to be in control .
Notice how Moses reacted when certain ones in the camp of Israel began behaving as prophets .
Joshua , Moses ’ assistant , wanted to restrain them .
For example , a brother named Peter served for more than 74 years in the full - time service , 35 of these at a branch office in Europe .
How should younger ones cooperate with older ones ?
Though such younger ones have a changed role , they would do well to benefit from the wisdom and experience of older ones before making decisions .
What do we learn from the cooperation between Timothy and the apostle Paul ?
Paul had taken time to teach Timothy his “ methods in connection with Christ . ”
Timothy learned well and had won Paul’s affection , and Paul was confident that Timothy could care for the spiritual needs of those in Corinth .
The earthly part of Jehovah’s organization is growing in many ways , but growth necessitates change .
As changes affect us personally , may we be humble , keeping an eye on Jehovah’s interests and not on our own . Doing so promotes unity .
To Christians in Rome , Paul wrote : “ I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think , but to think so as to have a sound mind , each one as God has given to him a measure of faith .
What might older ones and younger ones , as well as their wives , do to help maintain the peace and unity of Jehovah’s organization ?
Whatever our circumstances , then , let all of us work to further the interests of Jehovah’s magnificent Kingdom .
You younger brothers , accept responsibility , be modest , and maintain a respectful attitude toward the older ones .
May all of us , young or old , keep on “ having plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
15 : 58 .

However , God can help others to do the work . ​ — Ps .
37 : 5 .
LIFE STORY
After his release , Father entered the full - time ministry as a colporteur ( pioneer ) .
World War II broke out in 1939 , and the next year the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Canada was banned .
After school , several classmates assaulted me and knocked me to the ground .
In June 1951 , both were baptized , and six months later , they began pioneering .
During the interview , I was impressed by Mary’s spiritual attitude .
One week later , we were invited to receive training for circuit work , and for the next two years , we served a circuit in northern Ontario .
When we arrived at the branch in Brazil , we were introduced to the Portuguese language .
If a householder showed interest , it was suggested that we read scriptures describing life under God’s Kingdom .
My body had not adjusted to the hot , humid weather , and this was to be an ongoing challenge .
My assignment in the home was to help with the laundry and to obtain wood for cooking meals .
We led a simple life in rural areas ​ — doing without electricity , sleeping on mats , and traveling by horse and buggy .
We had to make many trips to the post office to pick up the boxes of magazines and carry them to our accommodations .
Heavy rains contaminated much of the drinking water and left us without a decent cafeteria area for the convention .
Surprise ! Shortly thereafter , we received a letter inviting us to serve in Portugal .
In view of this , it was best that we arrive without any welcome and avoid contact with the local Witnesses .
In January 1965 , contact was finally made with the branch office .
What a happy day it was when we attended our first meeting in five months !
As a result , the brothers adopted the practice of identifying one another by their given names , such as José or Paulo , rather than by their surnames . So we did the same .
All 49 members of the Feijó Congregation were brought to trial for attending an illegal meeting in a private home .
Our lawyer concluded his defense by courageously quoting Gamaliel of the first century .
In December 1966 , I was appointed branch overseer and spent much time on legal matters .
Legal recognition was finally granted on December 18 , 1974 .
Jehovah had opened the door for expansion in several islands in which Portuguese is spoken , including the Azores , Cape Verde , Madeira , and São Tomé and Príncipe .
On April 23 of that year , Brother Milton Henschel presided at the dedication of the new facilities in the presence of an enthusiastic audience of 45,522 .

“ Jehovah will always lead you . ” ​ — ISA .
How did the leaders of God’s ancient people and Jesus Christ give evidence that they were . . .
assisted by angels ?
“ WHO is your leader ? ”
That is a question often put to Jehovah’s Witnesses . And no wonder !
In contrast , we are proud to tell those who inquire that our Leader is not an imperfect human .
Both articles will consider three lines of evidence that Jehovah has indeed been behind those men , proving that he was ​ — and still is — ​ the true Leader of his people . ​ — Isa .
What equipped him to care for that weighty assignment ?
When the people complained about Moses ’ leadership , Jehovah asked : “ How much longer will this people treat me without respect ? ”
Indeed , Jehovah chose Moses , Joshua , Gideon , and David to represent him as Leader .
How did angels assist Moses ?
Jehovah “ transmitted through angels ” the Law , which Moses used to instruct the Israelites .
My angel will go ahead of you . ” The Bible does not report that the Israelites saw a materialized angel perform those duties .
For a brief period , Hezekiah’s “ heart became haughty . ”
Nevertheless , despite the imperfections of these men , the Israelites were expected to follow their lead .
After Jehovah had given instructions on how to set up the tabernacle , “ Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him . He did just so . ” ​ — Ex .
Later , the kings who ruled God’s people followed a similar routine .
How different those faithful kings were from the leaders of other nations , men who were guided by human wisdom and shortsighted strategy !
In some cases , Jehovah disciplined or replaced those leaders .
( a ) How did the prophets indicate that a unique leader was coming ?
“ You must listen to him . ”
( Read Matthew 23 : 10 . )
Holy spirit empowered Jesus .
In addition , holy spirit produced in Jesus perfect fruitage , including love , joy , and stalwart faith .
No other leader provided such convincing evidence .
( See paragraph 17 )
Shortly after Jesus was baptized , “ angels came and began to minister to him . ”
Hours before his death , “ an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him . ”
In fact , his obedience to God’s Word went as far as submitting to death on a torture stake .
Quoting Jehovah’s words through the prophet Isaiah , Jesus said about them : “ This people honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far removed from me .
Could Jehovah really choose any of those men to lead his people ?
When a rich man tried to glorify Jesus with the title “ Good Teacher , ” Jesus modestly replied : “ Why do you call me good ?
What happened next ?
“ Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him , because he did not give the glory to God , and he was eaten up with worms and died . ”
Whom would Jehovah use to work under Christ’s leadership and take the lead among His people ?
SONGS : 123 , 126
empowered by holy spirit ?
Jesus had given his followers a commission : “ You will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the most distant part of the earth . ”
How could they possibly complete that assignment ?
Hence , the apostles might have wondered , ‘ Will Jehovah now appoint a new leader ? ’
On that occasion , “ Peter stood up with the Eleven ” and shared lifesaving truths with a large crowd of Jews and proselytes .

Moreover , angels actively promoted and accelerated the preaching work that the governing body was overseeing .
Whether they were settling doctrinal issues or they were giving organizational direction , those spirit - anointed elders were led by the Scriptures . ​ — Acts 1 : 20 - 22 ; 15 : 15 - 20 .
True , Paul acknowledged the importance of “ holding fast the traditions , ” or Scripturally based practices , given by the apostles and other men who took the lead .
Yes , under his Head , Jehovah God , the invisible and glorified Christ Jesus was leading the congregation .
In recent years , responsible brothers of the “ other sheep ” have served as directors of the legal Society and of other corporations used by God’s people , thus allowing the Governing Body to focus on providing spiritual instruction and direction .
The July 15 , 2013 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body .
The Governing Body makes important decisions collectively .
How so ?
Of course , Jesus did not tell us that his faithful slave would produce perfect spiritual food .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the Governing Body ?
Evidence of holy spirit .
* The overall growth of the preaching and disciple - making work despite fierce opposition in some lands has likewise been possible only with superhuman assistance .
What contrast exists between the Governing Body and Christendom’s leaders ?
A recent book on religion in the United States notes : “ Christian leaders have regularly revised their teachings to match the beliefs and opinions gaining support among their members and in the larger society . ”
13 : 17 .
Are you one of the other sheep who supports the anointed in this vital work ?
How happy you will feel when your Leader , Jesus , says : “ To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . ” ​ — Matt .
Soon , he will lead us to everlasting life .
And no human leader can promise that !
He wants us to choose our own course in life .
Jesus spoke of a tragedy involving 18 people who were killed when a tower fell on them , and he indicated that those fatalities were not as a result of God’s will .
Is it not unreasonable to think that God would determine in advance who lives and who dies as a result of random events ?
But the Bible shows that he is selective when it comes to foreknowing future events .
Is that not what we would expect from the God who values our freedom and who always exercises his attributes in perfect balance ? ​ — Deut .
Such trials are not beyond our capacity to bear ​ — provided we rely on God .

Jehovah “ comforts us in all our trials ”
1 : 14 .
He can help us through fellow worshippers who by their words and deeds can be “ a strengthening aid ” to us . ​ — Col . 4 : 11 , ftn .
But when trials do arise in our life , we can be certain of this : If we fully trust in Jehovah , he will never allow our trials to go beyond the limit of human endurance ; he will always make a way out so that we can endure them .

Unless otherwise indicated , Scripture quotations are from the modern - language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
What rebellious actions did not defeat Jehovah’s purpose ?
How will Jehovah’s purpose be fulfilled ?
( b ) What assurance do we find at Isaiah 46 : 10 , 11 and 55 : 11 ?
( a ) What truths are fundamental to our understanding of the Bible’s message ?
( c ) What questions will we consider ?
No doubt , we are familiar with Bible truths about God’s purpose for the earth and mankind and about the central role of Jesus Christ in the outworking of God’s purpose .
Those who attend will learn much regarding God’s purpose .
Jehovah sets the standard for how his creation should work together .
4 : 11 .
6 , 7 .
Jehovah gave them free will , the ability to reason , and the capacity to love and to enjoy friendship .
The Creator spoke to Adam and instructed him on how to show his obedience .
Jehovah created Adam and Eve with the ability to have perfect children .
Earth , with all its resources , was to become their permanent home . ​ — Ps .
What purpose was served by the law found at Genesis 2 : 16 , 17 ?
After all , they had more food available than they could eat .
( See opening image . )
Then he tried to convince Eve that she need not listen to God , saying : “ God knows that in the very day you eat from it , your eyes will be opened . ”
By doing so , they joined Satan’s rebellion .
3 : 6 - 13 .
Therefore , he “ cannot tolerate wickedness . ”
Read John 3 : 16 .
Many whom we invite to the Memorial will know this verse by heart .
What points about the ransom could we highlight ?
Jehovah provided a perfect man who could become the ransomer .
But unlike Adam , Jesus lived up to the standard Jehovah expected from a perfect man .
As a perfect man , Jesus could save humankind from sin and death by dying in their behalf .
What does the ransom make possible ?
He values humanity so highly that he was willing to let his only - begotten Son die in our behalf .
Yes , on the basis of Jesus ’ sacrifice , Jehovah can accept humans back into his family without compromising his righteousness .
Satan’s rebellion did not stop Jehovah from extending his love to mankind , nor can it prevent even imperfect humans from being loyal to Jehovah .
Gratitude for the ransom should motivate us to do all we can to make others aware that they can benefit from that priceless gift .
The next article will consider how Jesus ’ sacrifice also addresses the moral issues that were raised by Satan back in the garden of Eden .
The ransom also makes it possible for us to have the opportunity to live forever in happiness .
Still , Christ’s ransom does more than provide a blessed future for obedient mankind .
( a ) What matters of universal importance are found in Jesus ’ prayer ?
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also on earth . ”
To heighten our appreciation for the ransom , let us consider how it relates to the sanctification of God’s name , the rule of God’s Kingdom , and the accomplishment of God’s purpose .
Jesus mentioned the sanctification of God’s name as the first request in his model prayer .
Jesus , on the other hand , truly loved the name of Jehovah .
( Read Psalm 40 : 8 - 10 . )
By his perfect life course on earth , Jesus proved that it is reasonable and righteous for Jehovah to set standards for his intelligent creatures .
Even when Satan subjected Jesus to an agonizing death , Jesus remained completely loyal to his heavenly Father .
By being loyal , Jesus proved that a perfect human could maintain perfect obedience to God’s righteous standards .
Even when we are persecuted , we do our best to live according to his righteous principles and laws .
By performing righteous deeds , we let our light shine and thus bring glory to Jehovah’s name .
79 : 9 .
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are imperfect ?
What blessings under Kingdom rule does the ransom make possible ?
The earth will be transformed into a paradise , and all faithful humans will be lifted to perfection , fully uniting the heavenly and earthly parts of God’s family .
By means of the Kingdom - preaching work , people throughout the earth would have an opportunity to learn about the ransom and become subjects of God’s Kingdom .
Today , we show our support for the Kingdom by assisting Christ’s brothers on earth in carrying out the commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom worldwide . ​ — Matt .
24 : 14 ; 25 : 40 .
Jehovah is the Creator .
Through the ransom , God gives all who exercise faith the opportunity to reach perfection and live forever .
Our loving heavenly Father will bring them back to life and give them an opportunity to learn about his purpose and to gain everlasting life .
In Paradise , Jesus will fulfill his role as “ the resurrection and the life . ” ​ — John 11 : 25 .
God’s Kingdom will be used to apply the benefits of the ransom to obedient mankind .
( See paragraphs 13 , 14 )
We prove that we desire to be “ sons of [ our ] Father who is in the heavens ” by loving our neighbor .
As we show love for fellow humans , we reflect God’s glory .
After we have reached perfection and have passed the final test , Jehovah will be delighted to sign the certificate , as it were , and adopt us as his beloved earthly children .
Jehovah’s love for his precious children is everlasting .
The benefits of the ransom last forever .
Thanks to Christ’s sacrifice , we are free from enslavement to this world under Satan’s control , and we no longer live in fear of death . ​ — Heb .
FROM OUR ARCHIVES
Since leaving the city a year earlier , they had traveled more than 12,000 miles ( 19,300 km ) through some of the most remote and rugged regions of the continent .
Arthur Willis and Bill Newlands were just two of the zealous pioneers determined to take the good news of God’s Kingdom to the vast Australian outback .
These pioneers visited many places that had never before received a witness .
When his bicycle tires wore out , he pressed on , confident that Jehovah would guide him .
Thus , Jehovah’s people have shown determination to find individuals in remote parts of the continent .
Pioneers Stuart Keltie and William Torrington demonstrated that sort of determination .
When their truck broke down , which happened often , they walked or cycled for days to the nearest town and then waited for weeks for replacement parts to arrive .
He added : “ Life is far better traversed with as little baggage as possible .
18 Serve Jehovah With a Complete Heart !
23 Will You Apply Your Heart to the Things Written ?
However , does that mean we cannot please Jehovah ?
32 A Bible Name on an Ancient Jar
You might be surprised to know , however , that on that very day , a small group of us were shivering in an unheated barn .
We were standing before a livestock watering trough that was partially filled with cold water !
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
And I wanted to preach the good news of the Kingdom .
The farm on Staten Island included the radio station WBBR .
His wisdom and exceptional knowledge of the Scriptures were a positive influence on all of us , and he took a personal interest in each of us .
He would place hundreds of our magazines each month .
Etta had assisted her when she came into the truth .
Thus , while serving at Bethel , I met another wise one , whom I have now walked with for 58 years .
For a time , I even worked for the new owners of the radio station , which used the call letters WPOW .
As a result , in early 1961 we were in a position to accept an assignment as special pioneers in Falls City , Nebraska .
We enjoyed the schooling and expected to use our training back in Nebraska .
I needed some time to regain my strength , but once I did , we again took up the full - time service .
Conventions had always been a highlight for me , so it was delightful to help organize these events .
As has been true for many in the special full - time ministry , exciting and challenging assignments awaited Angie and me .
For example , in 1995 , I was asked to teach the Ministerial Training School .
It was a real joy to be back where I had started my special full - time service over 40 years earlier .
In 2007 the Governing Body placed the schools taught at Bethel under the new Theocratic Schools Department , and for some years I was privileged to be the overseer .
The School for Congregation Elders was inaugurated in 2008 .
It is exciting to see the opportunities for theocratic education expand , and I am so grateful to have met many who make themselves available for this training .

SONGS : 10 , 16
Why might some individuals deserve to be honored , and what will we now discuss ?
It explains : “ He is the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords , the one alone having immortality , who dwells in unapproachable light , whom no man has seen or can see . ”
Our everlasting life depends on our doing so .
Why should we show a measure of honor and respect to people in general ?
Generally , they want to live with others in peace .
Whether they realize it or not , they reflect to some extent Jehovah’s glory , and for this reason , they deserve a measure of honor and respect . ​ — Ps .
Most imperfect humans are strongly influenced by the spirit of Satan’s world .
This brings benefits to all .
When the Roman Empire called on people to participate in a census , Joseph and Mary complied .
11 , 12 . ( a ) Why do we make a distinction between government officials and religious leaders ?
Dr . Heinrich Gleissner was a prisoner on the same train .
On the trip to the camp , Brother Engleitner respectfully explained his beliefs to Gleissner , who listened carefully .
You may recall other examples of the good that can come about when Witnesses manifest appropriate respect for public officials , rendering them the honor that the Bible says Christians should give them .
Who are especially worthy of being respected and honored , and why ?
Those related to us in the faith certainly merit honor and respect . This is especially true of the elders who are taking the lead .
Still , we do respect and honor such brothers for their hard work and humility . ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 ; Revelation 19 : 10 .
Such elders are recognized as humble spiritual shepherds .
In this they differ from many modern - day religious leaders and from those of the first century about whom Jesus said : “ They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces . ” ​ — Matt .
Moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
Admittedly , it may take time for us to achieve proper balance in regard to how and to whom we render honor .
They said that it would be a shame if they had no Witness children in their school .
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
Our doing that may help them to continue carrying out their duties with joy .
But this does not mean that we try to copy a “ prominent ” elder in the exact way he dresses and grooms himself , his manner of public speaking , or even his style of conversation .
The model to follow and imitate is Christ .
1 : 6 .
Why might we sometimes have to change a decision already made ?
Whichever way he decided , there would be consequences that would affect the rest of his life .
His decision and its resulting action cost his faithful brother Abel his life .
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
We certainly need faith in God , not doubting his willingness and ability to help us to be wise .
How should we view the need to make decisions ?
Reflect on some evidence of that .
( Read Joshua 24 : 15 . )
The people in the land who were not worshippers of Jehovah influenced the Israelites ’ thinking , moving them to follow that pagan crowd .
Jehovah had long before warned that such a thing could happen . ​ — Ex .
( Read Galatians 4 : 17 . )
Why ?
That is logical because those individuals will bear the responsibility for the results .
Still , others have a right and responsibility to make their own decisions .
Why is it dangerous simply to follow our heart if we are angry or discouraged ?
The core problem is that in imperfect humans , “ the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . ”
But the Scriptural passages cited in the preceding paragraph highlight the danger of letting emotions dictate our thinking and actions .
There may be occasions when it would be good for us to reconsider a choice or decision .
It could be when the prevailing circumstances change .
At times , it may be wise for us to do similarly .
( b ) Why and how should we view past decisions ?
Before determining a course of action , a family head ought to take the time to research the Scriptures and Christian publications , as well as to consider the opinions or views of others in his family .
In such areas , it is important to have full trust that Jehovah can and does provide wise guidance .
And bear in mind that Jehovah can give us the qualities we need to make decisions that are in harmony with his will .
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Jehovah does not coerce us into loving him and serving him .
But he expects us to follow through on other decisions that we make based on his guidance .

Thankfully , though , Jehovah does not deal with us “ according to our sins , ” provided that we are repentant and in faith approach him humbly on the basis of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
Both kings were imperfect and made mistakes .
Amaziah , on the other hand , was not fully devoted to Jehovah .
After gaining the victory over God’s enemies , he brought back their gods and began worshipping them . ​ — 2 Chron .
Jehovah blessed Judah with peace for the first ten years of Asa’s reign .
He expressed full confidence in Jehovah .
How can we imitate Asa in doing good ? ​ — 1 Ki .
15 : 14 .
Think how much courage Asa had to muster to stand up to Maacah , who was “ queen mother ” in the land !
You may be teased or ridiculed at school for taking a stand as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses . Or colleagues at work may taunt you for taking days off for spiritual activities or for not often working overtime .
Remember that God strengthened and helped Asa , and He will strengthen you .
When preaching , how can we show that we have a complete heart ?
Jehoshaphat did become afraid ! Yet , “ he resolved to search for Jehovah . ”
Sometimes we , like Jehoshaphat , may not know what to do , even being afraid .
God helped Jehoshaphat , and he will also help you .
To become known as a king who “ held fast to Jehovah , ” Hezekiah , unlike Jehoshaphat , had to overcome the bad influence of an idolatrous father .
37 : 36 , 37 .
How can you imitate Hezekiah as you serve God ?
Hezekiah later became sick to the point of dying .
( Read 2 Kings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
We read that Paul was “ intensely occupied with the word . ”
In what ways would you like to be like Josiah ?
Still , when what may have been the original writings of the Mosaic Law were found and read to Josiah , he saw the need to do God’s will more fully .
Repentant King Manasseh may have taught Josiah about God’s mercy .
Young ones , draw close to faithful older ones in your family and in the congregation and learn how good Jehovah has been to them .
Your reading of the Word of God may move you to take action that will increase your happiness and strengthen your friendship with God as well as spur you on to help others to search for God .
20 , 21 . ( a ) What do the four kings we considered have in common ?
Josiah
Still , they made some serious mistakes .
3 - 5 . ( a ) Though Asa’s heart was complete toward Jehovah , what problem did he face ?
Did Asa’s tactic succeed ?
Could he have given in to such reasoning as a result of receiving bad counsel ?
When we face problems that seem too much for us to deal with , it may be easy to see the need to rely on Jehovah .
But what do we do when we have to cope with smaller issues of daily life ?
Or do we look for Bible principles and try to apply them , thus showing that we rely on Jehovah’s way to solve problems ?
You ask Jehovah to direct you and help you discern the best way to handle the situation .
Or what if you lose your job , and you are having difficulty finding another ?
( See opening picture . )
He had many desirable qualities .
By relying on God , Jehoshaphat did much good .
Yet , he also made unwise decisions .
And despite a warning from the prophet Micaiah , Jehoshaphat joined Ahab in fighting against the Syrians .
Then he returned to Jerusalem .
Still , he was not immune to the effect of bad associations .
Recall this inspired proverb : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly . ”
Similarly , our having unnecessary association with those who do not serve Jehovah involves risks .
( b ) What should we bear in mind when faced with the problem of bad associations ?
A Christian may begin to have romantic feelings for someone who does not love Jehovah , thinking that a suitable mate cannot be found among true Christians .
In our time too , God’s eyes are “ roving about through all the earth , ” and he is ready “ to show his strength ” in our behalf .
When Hezekiah became very sick , God gave him a sign indicating that he would recover ​ — a shadow moving backward .
Could it have been because of his “ vast riches and glory ” ?
In any case , because Hezekiah was haughty , he “ did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him . ”
How can we benefit from reading the account of Hezekiah and meditating on it ?
Many praise him for what he has done .
15 , 16 .
Finally , what warning can we find in what happened to good King Josiah ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 35 : 20 - 22 . )
Why , then , did Josiah go out to fight ?
Moreover , God’s name was not involved , for Necho was taunting neither Jehovah nor his people .
Can we see in this a lesson that we can apply ?
She might consider relevant Bible texts , such as obeying God and the command to make disciples .
How can you benefit from considering the accounts of the four kings as set out in this article ?
There was a time , however , when their friendship was in jeopardy .
“ During a difficult time , I made some serious mistakes that caused us to drift apart , ” Maurizio explains .
Gianni adds : “ Maurizio was my Bible teacher when I started studying .
David , the shepherd and king , certainly had good friends .
But David had other friends , such as the prophet Nathan .
But then he committed this terrible sin !
What had happened to that good king ?
Would he let someone else bring up the matter to the king ?
After all , David already had innocent Uriah killed .
The prophet knew that if he remained silent , his relationship with David would not be the same and his own conscience would suffer .
12 : 1 - 14 .
You might be tempted to reason that pointing out his wrong would damage your friendship .
Or you might feel that reporting his sinful conduct to the elders , who could help him spiritually , would be a betrayal of your friendship .
I wondered : ‘ What can I tell him that he does not already know ?
Maurizio adds : “ Gianni was sincere ​ — and he was right .
I knew that the consequences of my bad choices were not his fault and not Jehovah’s fault .
When David’s son Absalom usurped the throne , many Israelites took Absalom’s side , but not Hushai .
David felt deeply hurt because of being betrayed by his own son and by some whom he had trusted .
Hushai did not simply do so out of a sense of duty as a court official . He proved to be a loyal friend . ​ — 2 Sam .
15 : 13 - 17 , 32 - 37 ; 16 : 15 – 17 : 16 .
Federico relates : “ When Antonio moved to our congregation , we soon became friends .
Shortly thereafter , he was appointed an elder .
Happily , in time Federico regained his balance and was later reappointed as a pioneer and a ministerial servant .
How would you feel if a close friend turned his back on you when you needed him most ?
Would you be able to forgive him ?
Yet , what happened when he was arrested ?
1 : 23 .
Are you this type of friend ?
The shards of a 3,000 - year - old ceramic jar unearthed in 2012 recently stirred the interest of researchers .
What was so special about this find ?
This is the first time that archaeologists have found this name in an ancient inscription .
This article reminds us of the excellent examples that Jephthah and Hannah set for us as we faithfully strive to fulfill our vows to God .
14 Life Story ​ — Determined to Be a Soldier of Christ
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
The system’s end is a certainty .
In the case of this world , though , the sentence has been determined by the perfectly just Sovereign of the universe .
We will discuss what four categories that will be gone when God’s Kingdom comes ?
So let us focus on what will be gone when God’s Kingdom comes .
After foretelling that this present era would involve “ critical times hard to deal with , ” the apostle Paul was inspired to write : “ Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse . ”
( b ) What will be the final outcome for wicked people who refuse to change ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 10 . )
Many have learned to hide what they do , and in this world they often seem to escape justice and consequences .
Yet , the Bible reminds us : “ God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man , and He sees all his steps .
Who are “ the meek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Much of the evil that is done in this world is the work not of individuals but of organizations .
Think , for instance , of the religious organizations that deceive millions of people about the nature of God , the trustworthiness of the Bible , the future of the earth and mankind ​ — and many other subjects .
What will Jehovah do ?
Afterward , there will be no corrupt organizations at all !
So the “ new earth ” will be organized .
Imagine a time when all corrupt organizations will be replaced by a single , unified , and incorruptible organization !
We live in a world full of wrongdoing . Immoral , dishonest , and brutally violent deeds seem to saturate this system of things .
What do we learn from Jehovah’s judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah ?
Consider what he did about the wrongdoing that was common in Sodom and Gomorrah .
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
What are some activities that you look forward to taking part in when this old system of things is gone ?
Think of the thrilling work of turning this planet into a paradise or of building homes for ourselves and our loved ones .
He will wipe it out .
And death ?
Jehovah will swallow it up forever !
What are some things that will be gone forever after Armageddon ?
No weapons or war memorials .
No hospitals , doctors , nurses , or health insurance ; no morgues , funeral homes , undertakers , or cemeteries !


“ The Rock , perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice . ” ​ — DEUT .
Matthew 18 : 15
( See opening picture . )
“ WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Such an act was “ unthinkable ” to Abraham .
Some 400 years later , Jehovah said of himself : “ The Rock , perfect is his activity , for all his ways are justice .
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
33 : 5 .
For example , some people have been unjustly convicted and imprisoned .
For good reason , Jehovah has provided practical advice in his Word to assist us to maintain our integrity , even if we experience wrongs at the hands of fellow believers . ​ — Ps .
What injustice did one brother experience in the congregation , and what qualities helped him to handle the matter properly ?
In 1946 , he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York , U.S.A .
In his life story , Brother Diehl related : “ In May 1949 , I informed headquarters in Bern that I planned to marry . ”
The response from the Bern office ? “ No privileges other than regular pioneering . ”
Eventually , the mistaken view regarding marriage that prompted the injustice was corrected , and Brother Diehl’s privileges of service were restored .
This could happen because of our imperfect view of matters or because we do not have all the facts .
( b ) What opportunity presented itself while Joseph was in prison ?
Joseph , a faithful servant of Jehovah , experienced injustice , not only at the hands of outsiders but also , more painfully , at the hands of his fleshly brothers .
Joseph explained that the cupbearer would be restored to his former position in Pharaoh’s court .
( b ) What details did Joseph evidently not include in his conversation with the cupbearer ?
On that basis , he asked the cupbearer to mention him to Pharaoh .
Note , however , that there is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that Joseph ever told anyone ​ — not even Pharaoh — ​ that his brothers were his kidnappers .
45 : 16 - 20 .
Negative speech may cause a problem to get out of control ( See paragraph 14 )
When a Christian believes that he is the victim of injustice , he should be careful not to engage in harmful gossip .
However , in many cases that do not involve serious wrongdoing , it may be possible to resolve a difference without involving anyone else , not even the elders .
When we have done all that we Scripturally can to remedy the situation , we need to leave the matter in Jehovah’s hands , confident that he will correct it in his own time and way .
As long as we live in this system of things , we can expect to experience injustices .
On rare occasions , you or someone you know may experience or observe what seems to be an injustice in the congregation .
Do not let yourself be stumbled .
Yes , we can be certain that Jehovah , “ the Judge of all the earth , ” will always do what is right , “ for all his ways are justice . ” ​ — Gen .

the vow that you have taken if you are in special full - time service ?
HE WAS a valiant leader ; she was a submissive wife .
Besides worshipping the same God , what could Judge Jephthah and Elkanah’s wife Hannah possibly have in common ?
Nevertheless , they are sacred and binding in God’s eyes because they carry the force of an oath ​ — a sworn statement — ​ that promises that a person will or will not do a certain thing .
The Mosaic Law stated : “ If a man makes a vow to Jehovah or swears an oath to impose on himself a vow . . . , he must not violate his word .
( b ) What do we want to learn about Jephthah and Hannah ?
David wrote : “ Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah , and who may stand up in his holy place ?
Anyone . . . who has not sworn a false oath by My [ Jehovah’s ] life , nor taken an oath deceitfully . ”
Earnestly desiring a victory , Jephthah vowed : “ If you give the Ammonites into my hand , then whoever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites will become Jehovah’s . ”
The result ?
( b ) What do Deuteronomy 23 : 21 , 23 and Psalm 15 : 4 impress upon you about making a vow to God ?
Even so , it was an emotionally difficult situation for father and daughter ​ — a real sacrifice for both of them .
That was not the most important consideration , though .
These were loyal individuals who would never have thought of breaking a vow that was made to the Most High God ​ — no matter what it cost them personally . ​ — Read Deuteronomy 23 : 21 , 23 ; Psalm 15 : 4 .
( a ) What did Hannah vow , and why , and how did it turn out for her ?
She made her promise when she was in great anguish and distress over her barrenness and the constant insults she was subjected to .
1 : 20 .
( a ) How easy was it for Hannah to pay her vow ?
For all his days , he is lent to Jehovah . ” There , “ the boy Samuel continued growing up before Jehovah . ”
Also , how determined should we be to keep our vows ?
The most important vow that a Christian can make is the one with which he dedicates his life to Jehovah .
I will pay my vows to Jehovah in the presence of all his people . ” ​ — Ps .
Recall that on your baptism day , before eyewitnesses , you were asked whether you had dedicated yourself to Jehovah and understood that “ your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in association with God’s spirit - directed organization . ”
Baptism is just the beginning , though .
Before God and eyewitnesses , the bride and groom exchange their marriage vows .
Others may not have said these exact words , but they still made a vow before God .
Why must Christians not adopt the world’s casual attitude toward marriage ?
Of course , there has never been a perfect marriage . Each marriage is made up of two imperfect people .
Sad to say , many individuals in this world have a casual attitude toward marriage .
Stop seeking a release . ”
The Bible does not set out grounds for marital separation .
However , some married Christians have viewed certain situations as a reason for separation , such as the extreme endangerment of one’s life or spirituality by an abusive or apostate spouse .
*
Because these tools highlight the godly principles that have helped many to strengthen their marriage .
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
By all means , apply Jehovah’s principles in your marriage .
Their respective vows resulted in Jephthah’s daughter and Hannah’s son being devoted to special , sacred service at the tabernacle . That meant a most satisfying way of life .
See the Appendix article “ The Bibleʼs View on Divorce and Separation ” in the book “ Keep Yourselves in Godʼs Love . ”
LIFE STORY
Cautiously , I approached them , not knowing whether I would live or die .
Impressed by John’s sound Scriptural reasoning , they began attending meetings of the Bible Students in our village .
Sadly , my father focused on people’s imperfections and gradually gave up attending Christian meetings .
Then , in 1939 , as World War II engulfed Europe , an event in our village jolted us .
He was tried by a military court and sentenced to ten years in jail .
In 1942 , the Karítsa Congregation had nine young men and women between the ages of 15 and 25 .
We all knew that severe trials lay ahead .
“ Would they not view us as active combatants ? ”
I , however , remained a captive .
The rebels panicked and fled .
I hid behind a fallen tree , which led to my encounter with the soldiers mentioned earlier .
When I told the Greek soldiers that I had been held captive by the communists , they took me to be assessed at a military camp near Véroia , the ancient Bible city of Beroea .
We drank putrid water and ate mostly lentils and eggplants .
Those activities and heartfelt prayer helped to sustain us spiritually .
There I was sentenced to three years in prison on Yíaros ( Gyaros ) , an island about 30 miles ( 50 km ) east of Makrónisos .
Instead , the deputy warden said : “ We know who you are , and we respect your stand . We know that we can trust you .
Our steadfastness also brought other fine results .
Later , along with many of my countrymen , I migrated to Melbourne , Australia .
5 : 2 .
Does the Almighty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
Jehovah is complete .
To what does Jehovah liken our kindly giving to others ?
The Israelites had been “ harshly oppressed ” by Canaanite King Jabin for 20 years .
Barak chased Sisera’s army all the way to Harosheth ​ — a 15 - mile ( 24 km ) route .
Israel’s enemy was defeated !
10 , 11 .
Meroz was evidently cursed so effectively that it is difficult to say with certainty what it was .
How could they not have heard of Jehovah’s call for volunteers ?
Yet , at that critical moment when given a choice between doing something and doing nothing , did they give in to indifference ?
So , too , should any who today are holding back from serving God fully .
How do we show our support for Jehovah’s sovereignty today ?
Millions of brothers , sisters , and young people are offering themselves in various fields of full - time service as pioneers , as Bethelites , as Kingdom Hall construction volunteers , and as volunteers at assemblies and conventions .
Think , too , of elders who carry weighty responsibilities with Hospital Liaison Committees and convention organization .
*
What is the effect of your volunteer service on those who benefit from it ?
32 : 3 , 4 .
This was the experience of a faithful servant of Jehovah named Naboth , who lived during the reign of King Ahab of Israel . ​ — 1 Ki .
9 : 26 .
In considering these Bible examples , we will learn that humility is essential if we are to demonstrate that we share Jehovah’s sense of justice .
Those Baal worshippers had no respect for Jehovah or appreciation for his standards .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Jehovah swiftly dispatched Elijah to confront Ahab .
With what result ?
Naboth , his sons , and their families will experience perfect justice when Jehovah resurrects the righteous ones .
Furthermore , a humble person remembers that “ the true God will judge every deed , including every hidden thing , as to whether it is good or bad . ”
What if your marriage mate , your son or daughter , or your close friend is disfellowshipped and you do not agree with the decision ?
Certainly , a humble response is in the best spiritual interests of all concerned . ​ — Read 1 Peter 5 : 5 .
What privileges did the apostle Peter enjoy , and how did he demonstrate courage ?
The apostle Peter was a well - known elder in the Christian congregation .
When Cornelius and his household received holy spirit , Peter acknowledged : “ Can anyone deny water to prevent these from being baptized who have received the holy spirit just as we have ? ” ​ — Acts 10 : 47 .
In 49 C.E . , the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem met to consider whether circumcision would be required of Gentiles who converted to Christianity .
At this meeting , Peter spoke boldly , reminding the brothers that some years earlier , uncircumcised Gentiles had received the gift of the holy spirit .
13 : 7 .
( See opening picture . )
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
As was true in the first century , there are no perfect elders in the modern - day Christian congregation , “ for we all make mistakes many times . ”
We may readily acknowledge this fact , but the challenge is when we are personally affected by the imperfections of a brother .
For example , how will you respond if an elder makes a remark that hints at a degree of prejudice ?
Will you allow yourself to be stumbled if an elder thoughtlessly makes a statement that offends or hurts you ?
The second article considers how applying Bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
13 Life Story ​ — Being Deaf Has Not Held Me Back From Teaching Others
Living in this system of things is not easy for any of Jehovah’s servants .
“ Jehovah is protecting the foreign residents . ” ​ — PS .
SONGS : 17 , 109
1 , 2 . ( a ) What trials do some of our brothers and sisters face ?
“ WHEN civil war started in Burundi , our family was at an assembly , ” relates a brother named Lije .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
Some of my family finally made it to a refugee camp in Malawi , a journey of over 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) .
The rest of us were scattered . ”
Worldwide , refugees who have fled their homes because of war or persecution now number over 65,000,000 ​ — the highest ever recorded .
Many have lost loved ones and nearly all their possessions .
What further challenges have some faced ?
After Jehovah’s angel warned Joseph that King Herod intended to kill Jesus , young Jesus and his parents became refugees in Egypt .
They remained there until Herod died .
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
Fleeing for any reason is seldom easy .
We survived day by day , praying to Jehovah and trusting in him , sometimes eating only mangoes that were growing along the way . ” ​ — Phil .
Most of Lije’s family eventually spent years in United Nations refugee camps .
Yet , they were not safe there .
Lije , now a circuit overseer , comments : “ Most people had no work .
4 : 18 .
While some people are displaced within their own country , many others are thrust into a totally unfamiliar environment in a new land .
However , often within months , refugees may be expected to support themselves .
2 : 3 , 4 .
How can we strengthen the faith of arriving refugees ?
They need to see that we care about them .
Our compassion and practical help can strengthen their faith . ​ — Prov .
( a ) What do refugees initially need ?
( See paragraphs 11 - 13 )
Also explain how they might approach people with the Kingdom message in your territory .
That guidance , along with their own efforts to pursue spiritual goals , helped them to blossom and to avoid being swallowed up by Satan’s system .
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
How can we support refugees ( a ) spiritually ?
( b ) emotionally ?
Elders can help by obtaining literature in the language of the refugees and by helping them contact brothers who speak their language .
Otherwise , they may be drawn to unbelieving relatives or compatriots who can relate to their culture and experiences .
By making them feel fully accepted in the congregation , we have the privilege to share with Jehovah in “ protecting the foreign residents . ” ​ — Ps .
Further , as notes Lije , “ many parents who saw family members raped and murdered cannot bear to bring their children back to where those tragedies occurred . ”
“ It is important to make clear right away that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses and that our primary mission is to help them spiritually , not materially , ” notes an elder who has helped many refugees .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
If you are an immigrant parent , how can you give your children the best possible opportunity to become spiritual children who “ go on walking in the truth ” ?
Avoid the unchristian view that children should provide their parents with a life of ease .
But a language barrier can make it difficult for you to teach your children the truth .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
“ Being in a foreign - language congregation has been fun , ” says Carolina , whose parents are immigrants . “ And it’s cool to be helping where there is a greater need . ”
Yet , as children of immigrants assimilate the local culture and language , some of them may lose much of their desire and even their ability to communicate in their parents ’ mother tongue .
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
*
Realistically , it may not be possible for some immigrant parents to become fluent in their children’s new language .
( b ) What should he do before making a decision ?
Let us consider some .
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
And a child’s native language will not necessarily remain the language of his mind or even of his heart .
If children do not identify with their parents ’ culture , they may resist learning their parents ’ language ​ — and their faith .
Joshua and Esther’s father , Samuel , relates : “ My wife and I observed our children to see in which language they thrived spiritually , and we prayed for wisdom . The answer was not what we personally found convenient .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
Adult children may come to realize that they could better serve Jehovah in a congregation that uses the language that they understand best .
If so , their parents need not feel that their children are rejecting them .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Further , many young people thrive under the influence of spiritually balanced companions who may , for example , accompany them in the ministry and share with them in wholesome recreation .
How did this come to be ?
Happily , I was not harmed , but that was the day my family discovered that I was deaf .
A family friend suggested that I be educated with other deaf children , so Uncle Nick enrolled me in the school for the deaf located in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan .
I was moved to a location several hours away from my family , and since I was only five years old , I was terrified .
I could visit my family only on holidays and during summer vacations .
Before long , I wanted to get baptized , and on September 5 , 1941 , Bill baptized me in a steel drum filled with water pumped out from a well . The water was very , very cold !
With a group of deaf people at a convention in Cleveland , Ohio , in 1946
On the first day of the convention , my sisters took turns writing notes in order to help me follow the program .
Finally , I could enjoy the program , and it was wonderful at last to understand Bible truth clearly !
I returned from the convention determined to take my stand for my faith in school .
Such fellow students as Larry Androsoff , Norman Dittrick , and Emil Schneider eventually accepted the truth , and they are serving Jehovah loyally to this day .
Until his death last year , he belonged to the sign - language congregation in Laval , Quebec .
She accepted a magazine subscription and wanted me to meet her husband , Gary .
That was the only contact we had until a few years later when , to my surprise , they spotted me in a crowd at a convention in Toronto , Ontario .
There I met a mother who asked me to study the Bible with her deaf twin daughters , Jean and Joan Rothenberger , who were students at the same school for the deaf that I once attended .
She would later become a very important part of my life ​ — she became my wife !
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
When we got married in 1960 , her parents did not come to our wedding .
My son Nicholas and his wife , Deborah , serve at London Bethel
As deaf parents , we raised seven hearing boys .
BIBLE STUDIES

SONGS : 38 , 128
ONE facet of the sign that Jesus gave regarding “ the conclusion of the system of things ” was that “ the love of the greater number [ would ] grow cold . ”
On the other hand , most Christians at that time kept busy “ declaring the good news about the Christ ” and showing love for God , for fellow Christians , and for unbelievers .
Nevertheless , some of Jesus ’ followers in the first century did allow their love to grow cold .
Speaking to first - century Christians living in Ephesus , the resurrected Jesus Christ said : “ I hold this against you , that you have left the love you had at first . ”
What may have been one reason for this ?
Jesus ’ prophecy about diminishing love extends to our day .
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first commandment . ”
However , Satan and his world strive to undermine our love for God .
If we give ear to such teachings , we could drift away from Jehovah , and our love could grow cold . ​ — Heb .
( a ) Many of Jehovah’s people face what discouraging circumstances ?
In this wicked system controlled by Satan , all of us at times face discouraging circumstances .
Perhaps we are presently confronted with problems caused by old age , poor health , or economic pressures .
Yet , we should never allow such circumstances or feelings to convince us that Jehovah has left us .
We find such words at Psalm 136 : 23 , which states : “ He remembered us when we were low , for his loyal love endures forever . ”
Indeed , Jehovah’s loyal love for his servants is constant .
Therefore , we can be sure that he hears our “ pleas for help ” and responds to them . ​ — Ps .
In fact , while he was a prisoner , Paul wrote several encouraging letters .
He wrote to fellow believers : “ Pray constantly . ”
11 , 12 .
Do we take the time to ponder , or dwell on , Scriptural passages throughout the day ?
Our appreciation for Bible truth will grow when we meditate on ways we benefit from applying it in our lives .
We can allow it to linger on our figurative palate so that we can recall the “ delightful words ” of truth and use them to help others . ​ — Eccl .
The prophet Jeremiah loved Scriptural truth .
Notice the effect that God’s words had on his heart .
In that way he developed a heartfelt appreciation for the privilege of having God’s name called on him .
How can we enhance our love for Bible truth ?
Besides reading the Bible and our Bible - based publications , how else can we develop a deep love for Bible truth ?
One way we can do so is by looking up each of the cited Bible texts .
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
A widow may need help with some repairs on her home .
We give proof that we truly love our brothers when we show by words and deeds that we have deep concern for “ those related to us in the faith . ” ​ — Gal .
6 : 10 .
The Bible foretold that “ the last days ” of this wicked system of things would be marked by a spirit of selfishness and greed .
True , we may at times have minor disagreements with fellow believers .
Rather , may we continue to have intense love for Jehovah , his Word , and our brothers .
After spending a night fishing , what experience did Peter have ?
From the beach , the resurrected Jesus observed the group .
So they cast it , but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
In his illustration of the sower , Jesus said that some would accept “ the word of the Kingdom ” and make initial progress but that “ the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches ” would “ choke the word . ”
How can we make sure that we continue to do so ?
In this regard , let us consider three areas of life that if not kept in their proper place could weaken our love for the Christ and for spiritual things ​ — secular work , recreation , and material things .
What stresses exist in the modern workplace ?
What did this brother do ?
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
Jesus set the standard in balancing secular interests and spiritual matters .
Jesus was teaching Martha a valuable lesson .

Give an example .
However , the danger exists that having a good time could become the primary focus of our life .
That same spirit prevails in many parts of the world today .
We could select a week and keep a record of the number of hours we spend on spiritual activities , such as attending meetings , sharing in the field ministry , and engaging in personal and family Bible study .
As imperfect people , all of us need to keep up our fight against “ the desires of our flesh , ” including materialism . ​ — Eph .
Why ?
Once their powers of discernment have become clouded , it becomes more difficult for them to distinguish right from wrong .
As a result , some develop an uncontrolled desire for material things ​ — a desire that can never be fully satisfied .
We today are likewise determined to remain steadfast in our love for Christ , keeping secular work , recreation , and material things in their proper place .
May our choices in life reflect that we share the sentiments of Peter , who told Jesus : “ Lord , you know I have affection for you . ”
Individuals who were spreading false teachings tried to weaken and divide congregations .
That was the situation when John wrote to Gaius .
Despite the challenges he faced , Gaius continued to serve Jehovah faithfully .
Why do we want to imitate Gaius ’ example today ?
3 : 2 ; 3 John 5 .
Whatever the case , they traveled for the sake of the good news .
John said : “ It was in behalf of his name that they went out . ”
John also wanted to help him deal with a serious problem .
No more is known about our dear brother of old , Gaius .
In what ways can we “ follow the course of hospitality ” ?
First , to some extent , most of us owe our knowledge of the truth to faithful ones who were willing to travel in order to make it known to us .
Third , fellow Christians who serve Jehovah loyally despite opposition need to be acknowledged and warmly commended for their faithful course .
The apostle John surely encouraged Gaius and reassured him that he was doing what was right .
40 : 31 ; 1 Thess .
At a convention in 2006 , Daniel was deeply touched by a talk that raised the question : “ Are we doing all we can to help those who are ‘ staggering to the slaughter ’ to get on the road to everlasting life ? ”
In May 2007 , Daniel and Miriam quit their jobs and set out for Panama , a country they had visited before .
Before long , they were conducting 23 Bible studies .
They trusted in the promise found at Psalm 37 : 5 : “ Commit your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”
Today we do , and we lack nothing of real importance . ”
The chairman announced that during this important session , anyone was free to leave , but no one would be allowed to reenter the hall .
A few restlessly paced about in the heat .
The speaker earnestly urged them to sit down and listen .
“ Then back to the field , O ye sons of the most high God ! ” Brother Rutherford thundered .
Anna Gardner described how “ the rafters shook with the applause . ”
“ The whole audience rose to its feet as one , ” stated Fred Twarosh .
Yet , they now felt infused with a new sense of purpose .
Ethel Bennecoff related that the Bible Students went forth “ with more zeal and love in [ their ] hearts than ever before . ”
The one thing I did know was that I wanted to be like Isaiah , who said : ‘ Here I am !
Send me ! ’ ”
“ That celebrated day , ” said Ralph Leffler , “ was the real beginning of the Kingdom advertising campaign that today has encircled the earth . ”
Likely , many of us today have similar precious memories of a convention that especially thrilled our hearts and filled us with zeal and with love for our great God and his King .
As we reflect on such memories , we too are moved to say , “ Thank you , Jehovah , for permitting me to be there . ”

27 Uphold Jehovah’s Sovereignty !
32 Did You Know ?
1 : 3 , 4 .
4 , 5 .
What are some causes of ‘ tribulation in the flesh ’ ?
Jehovah said that when he performed the first human marriage .
Yet , under imperfect conditions , getting married and setting up a new household can strain family relationships .
According to God’s Word , a wife is to accept that she will be directed by her husband rather than by her parents .
The new mother’s time and attention may be focused on caring for her child .
On the other hand , a new father has new responsibilities to shoulder . His duties increase because he has a new family member to care for and provide for .
Neither marriage nor childbearing guarantees freedom from cares , yet an unfulfilled desire for children is in its own way a ‘ tribulation in the flesh . ’
In Bible times , barrenness often carried a stigma .
She and her husband decided to adopt a child .
I knew that adoption would not be exactly the same as giving birth to my own child . ”
How can a person cope with the loss of a loved one ?
Yes , a distinct trial that many have faced is that of losing a beloved marriage mate in death .
This is a trial that the survivor may not have expected to face in this system of things .
What does that prospect do for the surviving mate ?
How can prayer provide us with comfort ?
How good it is to know , though , that Jehovah is “ the God of all comfort ” !
Similarly , in the face of tribulation , we need to do more than simply mention to Jehovah how we feel .
What helped the widow Anna to find joy ?
In Jesus ’ day , the prophetess Anna lost her husband after only seven years of marriage .
Yes , Anna found comfort as well as joy in worshipping Jehovah .
But she was greatly encouraged when Ann , a pioneer sister in the congregation , took a keen personal interest in her spiritual welfare .
Those who give comfort can experience what blessings ?
Certainly , all of us contribute to a close bond in the congregation when we show concern for others , those in our territory and those in the congregation .
The apostle Paul was a fine example .
Scripturally , the primary responsibility to teach and train young ones lies with the parents .
And if such a study is conducted , it would be wise to do so either in the children’s home with the parents or another mature Witness around or in a suitable public area .
Before the Flood , Seth’s descendant Lamech worshipped Jehovah .

If we treasure God’s Kingdom in our heart , what will we be motivated to do ?
Over the years , the merchant had no doubt bought and sold hundreds of pearls .
If we love God’s Kingdom as much as the merchant loved the pearl , what will we do ?
Consider two individuals who did just that .
How did Zacchaeus show his determination to gain God’s Kingdom ?
Zacchaeus was a chief tax collector who had become rich by extorting money .
Yet , when that unrighteous man heard Jesus preach about the Kingdom , he recognized the excelling value of what he was hearing and took immediate action .
As Rose studied the Bible , however , she discerned the excelling value of the truth about God’s Kingdom .
But she realized that she would have to make major adjustments .
Rose was baptized in 2009 , and the next year , she began to serve as a regular pioneer .
To help us maintain our wholehearted love for God’s Kingdom , Jehovah has given us another priceless treasure .
The apostle Paul recognized the high value of the ministry .
He described the ministry of the new covenant as a “ treasure in earthen vessels . ”
What are some ways that we can demonstrate our appreciation for the ministry ?

“ I still do not speak Russian perfectly , ” Irene admits .
Yet , Jehovah has blessed her zealous spirit and that of others like her .
Today , there are six Russian congregations in New York City .
Do you view your ministry as a treasure and manifest that in your weekly schedule ?
What positive results come from continuing to preach despite persecution ?
If we treasure our ministry , we will be like the apostle Paul , continuing to preach despite persecution .
In 1943 , Brother Nathan H .
This same firm stand by brothers in other countries has led to similar victories .
Rather , we will do everything in our power “ to bear thorough witness to the good news . ”
A third spiritual treasure is our repository of revealed truths .

As a generous Father , he shares divine truths with those who fear him .
Jehovah will help us to collect precious new truths into our “ treasure store ” if we search for them as for hidden treasures .
We must develop good personal study habits and do careful research in God’s Word and in our publications .
Why might we refer to some truths as “ old , ” and what are some that you especially treasure ?
Why are such efforts worthwhile ?
How can this help us as public instructors of the good news ?
Peter asked the man if he would like to understand the Bible .
Somewhat shocked , the man responded that this was a house of Jewish rabbis .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
Yes , the holy spirit can bring back to our mind thoughts we previously read and securely placed in our treasure store . ​ — Luke 12 : 11 , 12 ; 21 : 13 - 15 .
We could easily be enticed by promises of a lucrative career , dreams of a lavish lifestyle , or the desire for a showy display of material riches .
The apostle John reminds us that this world is passing away and so is its desire .
Continue to preach zealously , never losing appreciation for our lifesaving ministry .
For instance , a prominent witch doctor in Madagascar observed the harmony enjoyed by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He said to himself , ‘ If ever I wanted to follow a religion , this would be the one . ’
However , the Bible makes it clear that the presence of “ bitter jealousy and contentiousness ” in the congregation can destroy friendships and create trouble .
To set the stage for doing so , let us consider some real - life situations .
“ A sister with whom I often preached suddenly ended our arrangements for the ministry .
One of the others said good - bye , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said unkind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hung up . ” ​ — MICHAEL .
You might feel that those incidents appear minor .
Still , each had the potential for causing lasting emotional and spiritual injury to those involved .
You will be pleased to know , though , that peace was restored by those brothers and sisters , who all used the Bible as their guide .
When a person does not control his feelings and gets upset easily , he may provoke others to anger .
Wanting to change , he apologized to the brother with whom he had been arguing and then worked hard to control his temper .
Janet concluded that she needed to take that truth more to heart .
She decided to ‘ consult , ’ or speak with , the other sister .
She apologized , and they are once again serving Jehovah as a team .
He was determined to make an effort to restore peace .
Their friendship was restored .
They accepted the elder’s counsel and applied it .
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
Simply approach your brother or sister and kindly and humbly try to discuss the matter and settle it .
Like oil that lubricates a machine , those godly qualities allow for a smooth peacemaking process .
What was Peter like ? You may think of him as outspoken and impulsive . What of John ?
There may be some basis for such ideas about those two apostles . It seems that they differed in personality .
Still , they worked well together .
Is he maliciously trying to cause me discomfort ?
Your doing so may not turn you into close companions , but it can help to draw you together and increase peace ​ — in you and in the congregation as a whole .
Like weeds growing wild in a flower garden , bad feelings toward others will likely get worse unless we strive to uproot them .
It really bothered me . As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
That “ uniting bond of peace ” is priceless .
Those taking the lead respected him , and he helped Paul .
On hearing Barnabas ’ testimony , the Jerusalem congregation accepted Paul .

Thus , different personalities need not produce conflict ​ — not then , not today .

Unless otherwise indicated , Scripture quotations are from the modern - language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
THE above words were spoken by David of ancient Israel in praise of a woman whom he encountered .
That was hardly an unreasonable request , considering how David and his men had protected Nabal’s interests .
Nabal and his household would pay for his stupidity . ​ — 1 Sam .
25 : 2 - 13 , 21 , 22 .
We can easily see that we would never want to be like Nabal , unappreciative of good things done for us .
Whether they verbalize it or not , they may feel like David , who said : “ Blessed be your good sense ! ”
However , a very big issue facing all of us is the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty .
We need to guard against losing sight of this vital issue .
We could become so absorbed in the demands of our day - to - day life that we forget just how important the vindication of God’s sovereignty really is .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be settled ?
So why has God chosen to allow the issue to go on , giving Satan time to try to prove his point ?
But after Jehovah’s sovereignty is vindicated , all will submit everlastingly to his righteous rule .
What is our role in supporting Jehovah’s side of the issue of sovereignty ?
It is more important than the personal happiness of any individual .
Not at all .
Why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning . ”
Hence , Jehovah will see to it that the vindication of his sovereignty includes the salvation of obedient humans !
That correct perspective is important if we are to keep our eyes on this big issue and take our stand for Jehovah’s righteous rule .
Satan next afflicted Job with a painful and repulsive illness .
( a ) What did Job do that showed his integrity to God ?
Satan’s claim was shown to be completely false .
Job refused to turn his back on God .
However , Job temporarily lost the proper perspective .
God’s words to Job fill four chapters in the book of Job ​ — chapters 38 through 41 .
The main point of Jehovah’s words was not to explain to Job why he was suffering , as if God had to justify himself .
And he helped Job to see that there were greater issues with which to be concerned .
This helped Job regain the proper perspective .
Was Jehovah harsh in giving such straightforward counsel after Job had endured so severe a trial ?
He even stated : “ I take back what I said , and I repent in dust and ashes . ”
Earlier , Job had also received corrective counsel from young Elihu .
Jehovah’s counsel would continue to benefit Job even after his trials were over .
Even if he eventually better understood the reason for his trials , he may on occasion have thought about why it was necessary for him to suffer to such an extent .
After all , Jehovah had it preserved “ for our instruction , so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope . ”
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
So we can be sure that he will reward us and all who uphold his sovereignty .
Even relatively minor ones can loom large in our mind if we dwell on them .
For example , a Witness named Renee suffered a stroke and struggled with chronic pain and cancer .
Even as she approached death , Renee never lost sight of Jehovah’s sovereignty .
Feeling alone and exhausted , she could easily have surrendered to self - pity .
Instead , she prayed to see how she might be of spiritual help to others experiencing similar frustration .
She witnessed to many people and placed much literature .
Indeed , she stayed focused on Jehovah’s purpose .
Appreciation for Jehovah’s sovereignty has distinguished true religion from false .
Be assured that Jehovah treasures your efforts to uphold his sovereignty by your faithful service and endurance of trials .
The next article will consider further why Jehovah’s sovereignty is deserving of your wholehearted support and how you can uphold it .
Of what must each of us be convinced ?
AS DISCUSSED in the preceding article , the Devil contends that Jehovah exercises his sovereignty in an unworthy way and that mankind would be better off ruling themselves .
Jehovah is the rightful Sovereign of the universe because he is the almighty God and Creator .
In rebelling against Jehovah’s sovereignty , he and the first human couple acted arrogantly .
No .
He declares : “ I am Jehovah , the One showing loyal love , justice , and righteousness in the earth , for in these things I take delight . ”
He does not look to any written code of laws made by imperfect men as a basis for determining what is just and fair .
“ Righteousness and justice are the foundation of [ his ] throne , ” so we can be confident that all of his laws , principles , and decisions are righteous .
What is one reason why Jehovah has the right to govern the world ?
Moreover , Jehovah is the rightful Sovereign because he has the knowledge and wisdom needed to care for the universe .
The world under Satan’s influence is still searching for a way to settle national and international disputes .
He is “ merciful and compassionate , slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth . ”
God treats his human servants with dignity and respect .
He cares for us better than we can care for ourselves .
How do we know that God’s concern extends to individuals ?
1 : 5 , 16 .
Whatever he requires of us is for our benefit and ultimately results in our greatest joy .
But more to the point : Will such a false claim hold any appeal for us ?
How else can we show our support ?
When we handle matters as Jehovah would , we show that we love and uphold his way of ruling . ​ — Read Ephesians 5 : 1 , 2 .
Instead , they will imitate Jehovah .
Paul was just such an imitator of God and his Son .
We benefit from doing so , for God has our interests at heart .
It is not Jehovah’s way to provide a specific command for every situation .
When we guide our steps , not solely by preference , but primarily by Jehovah’s thinking and concerns , we show that we love and support his way of ruling .
Uphold God’s sovereignty in making decisions and in family activities ( See paragraphs 16 - 18 )
Consider an area wherein Christian married couples can support Jehovah’s ways and thereby uphold his sovereignty .
What if married life proves to be more challenging than expected ?
Accordingly , married couples who love Jehovah’s ways imitate him .
By making the best of their situation and even seeking to improve it , they uphold Jehovah’s righteous way of ruling .
Being imperfect , we will on occasion do things that disappoint Jehovah .
Thus , when we fall short in some respect , we should ask Jehovah for forgiveness .
Rather than continually berate ourselves , we should endeavor to learn from the mistake .
ACCORDING to the account of Matthew’s Gospel , “ Jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves . And he said to them : ‘ It is written , “ My house will be called a house of prayer , ” but you are making it a cave of robbers . ’ ” ​ — Matt .
When did true Christians come into Babylonian captivity ?
During the 1520 ’ s , Lefèvre translated the Bible into French to make it available to the common people .
The former leads to death , the latter to life and peace . ​ — w16.12 , pp .
“ Enoch was transferred so as not to see death . ”
11 : 5 ) How ?
Modesty involves having a proper estimate of ourselves and an awareness of our limitations .
Why is negative gossip so dangerous ?
Whether we are right or wrong , engaging in hurtful speech will never improve matters . ​ — w17.04 , p . 21 .
He repeatedly rejected many acts of human kindness . ”
Peter began to change .
One entry read : “ I learned God’s name today .
After the funeral , Peter’s sister Ummi explained : “ About two years ago , Peter contacted me . For the first time in years , he seemed happy .

7 Seeking Riches That Are True
12 “ Weep With Those Who Weep ”
This article explains , and it shows why we should have a like desire to praise our God .
Why was the campaign organized ?
Who shared in it ?
About 550 Turkish - speaking brothers and sisters from other countries traveled to Turkey and preached alongside the local publishers during the campaign .
A widespread witness was given .
We see Jehovah’s Witnesses everywhere ! ’ ”
Zeal for the ministry increased .
Şirin
Şirin , a sister from Germany , wrote : “ The brothers in Turkey witness informally with great ease .
I am very shy when it comes to preaching informally .
Stéphanie ( center )
Take , for example , a small isolated group of 25 publishers in one area .

Consider what some have said :
Would he recommend this type of service ?
You really feel Jehovah’s care more than ever . ”
By means of the special preaching campaign in Turkey , the good news reached many more people .
If so , we encourage you : “ Lift up your eyes and view the fields , that they are white for harvesting . ”
If so , begin taking practical steps now toward reaching that goal .
32 - 33 .
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
TODAY’S economic system is harsh and unfair .
Young people search in vain for employment .
What experiences show that God’s people fully trust in him in this challenging environment ? ’
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that today’s commercial system was not part of God’s purpose ?
However , Jesus urged his followers to make friends in heaven for unselfish purposes .
8 , 9 .
A young girl in India kept a small money box and gradually added coins , even giving up toys to do so .
When the box was full , she handed the money over to be used for the preaching work .
A brother in India who has a coconut farm contributed a large number of coconuts to the Malayalam remote translation office , reasoning that since the office needs to buy coconuts , his supplying them directly will help his contribution to go further than it would if he gave cash .
That is practical wisdom .
A brother from Sri Lanka , now living abroad , has made his property back home available for meetings and assemblies and for housing full - time servants .
I am more generous in being forgiving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disappointments and counsel . ”
Those who have this world’s means but cannot share in the full - time ministry or move abroad have the satisfaction of knowing that their donated funds support the ministry of others .
Voluntary contributions help to supply literature and support the preaching work in territories where poverty abounds but where there is great spiritual growth .

How did Abraham show that he trusted in God ?
( a ) What admonition did Paul give to Timothy ?
Resisting the pressures of advertising and the world around them , they remember the principle : “ The borrower is a slave to the lender . ”
Satan would like nothing better than to have us spend all our time and energy as slaves to his commercial world .

A special blessing for them has been to serve at Bethel with their daughter and son - in - law and , for some weeks , with the husband’s parents , who also worked on the Warwick project .
Such determination to put Kingdom interests first shows that we value God’s friendship and spiritual riches far more than what today’s commercial world can offer .
For example , when Lucia * learned of the need for ministers in Albania , she moved there from Italy in 1993 with no means of support , trusting fully in Jehovah .
6 : 20 .
How would we feel if we reached the end of our life in this world and realized that we had sacrificed true riches for a vast store of this world’s “ unrighteous riches ” ?

Gold , silver , and gems will be for adornment , not for investment or hoarding .
High - quality materials of wood , stone , and metal will be freely available to build beautiful homes .
Friends will assist us for sheer satisfaction , not for money .
Jesus does not indicate whether the accusation was valid .
Jesus , though , focuses on the steward’s reaction , not on the reasons for the dismissal .
The life story of Lucia Moussanett appears in the June 22 , 2003 , issue of Awake ! , pp .

( See opening picture . )
However , does it really follow that time by itself will heal a broken heart ?
Without a doubt , the primary source of consolation is our compassionate heavenly Father , Jehovah .
Jehovah , the foremost example of empathy , assured his people : “ I myself am the One comforting you . ” ​ — Isa .
Words cannot express the pain Jehovah must have suffered . ​ — John 5 : 20 ; 10 : 17 .
Since “ the Chief Agent of life ” personally understands what it is like to feel grief , “ he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test . ”
If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
94 : 19 .
What is one important way in which we can be a source of comfort to others ?
* Often , though , the most helpful thing you can do is to “ weep with those who weep . ”
“ Tears have become the language of my heart , ” admits Gaby , whose husband died . “ That is why I get some comfort when friends cry with me .
What is a particularly effective way to provide consolation ?
Even though it may be difficult to express your prayerful thoughts in such an emotional situation , your heartfelt supplication in his behalf , even through tears and an unsteady voice , can be a powerful antidote to grief .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”
“ I expected my first wedding anniversary to be very traumatic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
Bear in mind , though , that bereaved ones need encouragement not only on special occasions .
When Jesus performed his first miracle , turning water into wine , there was no mention of Joseph ​ — then or on any subsequent occasion .
Christians strive to be exemplary .
How a Christian chooses to protect himself , his family , or his possessions is , of course , largely a personal matter , as is his choice of employment .
They know that true and lasting security comes to those who demonstrate trust in God by living in harmony with Bible principles . ​ — Ps .

“ Praise Jah ! . . .
We can praise him because of his immense power , as seen in the wonders of his creation , or because of his warm dealings with humankind , as evidenced by his provision of the ransom sacrifice of his own Son .
By then Jerusalem , their greatest reason to rejoice in Jehovah , had been desolated .
What a comforting effect this development must have had on the Israelites dwelling in Babylon !
God understands your limitations , ‘ remembering that you are dust . ’
I want you to enjoy your life as one of my Witnesses ! ”
9 , 10 .
What comes first when Jehovah extends help to us ?
Illustrate .
Through their spiritual brothers , they received relief supplies .
But what strengthened them most were the visits made to the congregation by the representatives of God’s organization .
God provides spiritual sustenance first , and then he satisfies our physical needs .
But how can we benefit from his readiness to act in our behalf ?
We have to have a good relationship with him .
To benefit from Jehovah’s loyal love and to avoid his wrath , we have to hate what he hates .
For instance , we are to hate sexual immorality .
Jehovah gives us a basis for being convinced that he will help his people when they are in need .
In thinking about the restoration of Jerusalem , the psalmist sang about Jehovah : “ He makes the bars of your city gates strong ; he blesses your sons within you .
He adds that Jehovah “ sends out his word , and they melt . ”
Simone has experienced the power of God’s Word .
However , during times of discouragement , she persevered in prayer , turning to Jehovah for his help .
37 : 4 .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
You have to decide what to do with the rest of your life . ”

Consider , too , how he cares for us and teaches us the best way of life .
When he was 12 years old , the teachers at the temple were amazed at “ his understanding and his answers ” regarding spiritual matters . ​ — Luke 2 : 42 , 46 , 47 .
Jesus grew up to be a happy adult .
( Read Luke 10 : 21 . )
Why not discuss your plans with some of them ?

As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
I love teaching people , as I can see that holy spirit is changing them . ” ​ — 1 Thess .
2 : 19 .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
I started pioneering soon after finishing school .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
I’m glad I planned to share fully in the disciple - making work . ” ​ — Eccl .
Many blessings await those who enter the full - time service ( See paragraphs 11 - 13 )
Some who acted on their plans to serve Jehovah full - time are now at Bethel .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
Learn to be interested in people by tactfully asking their opinion and listening to their response .
Jehovah is pleased to use those who have a humble , willing spirit .
So think about what you want to do with your life .
Consider what Jehovah is doing in our time and how you can have a share in his service .
Then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
A weapon specially designed to attack , not your body , but your mind .
Some equate propaganda with “ lies , distortion , deceit , manipulation , mind control , [ and ] psychological warfare ” and associate it with “ unethical , harmful , and unfair tactics . ” ​ — Propaganda and Persuasion .
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”

Because propaganda “ is likely to be most effective , ” says one source , “ if people . . . are discouraged from thinking critically . ”
It strongly warns us against isolating ourselves from the congregation .
Was it the world’s spirit or God’s spirit ? ’ ​ — Gal .
So propagandists attempt to break bonds of confidence and trust between a soldier and his commander .

Satan does this .
Your defense ?
Stick to the truth you learned , and remember where you learned it .
Keep in mind , though , that Satan’s propaganda is not always subtle .
( Easily Led ​ — A History of Propaganda ) The Assyrians , for example , dominated their enemies with “ a policy of terror coupled with one of propaganda , ” wrote British Professor Philip M .
Do not let Satan use fear itself to weaken your morale or break your integrity .
You may , of course , encounter frightening , morale - weakening events .
Do you remember the propaganda used by the Assyrian envoy , the Rabshakeh , against God’s people ?
He boldly added : ‘ Jehovah himself told us to destroy this land . ’
19 : 35 .
Shut your ears , then , to Satan’s propaganda .
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The first article explains why we should be willing to wait on Jehovah .
17 How We Strip Off and Keep Off the Old Personality
22 How We Put On and Keep On the New Personality
The second article considers several qualities that are part of the new personality and explains how we can demonstrate these in our life and ministry .
32 Questions From Readers
SONGS : 114 , 79
Or maybe we are enduring old age and sickness or the pressures of living in these “ critical times ” that are so “ hard to deal with . ”
But what can help us when we come face - to - face with such difficult circumstances ?
The disciple James , Jesus ’ half brother , was inspired to tell us : “ Be patient then , brothers , until the presence of the Lord . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) What is involved in being patient ?
According to the Bible , patience is a product of holy spirit ; without God’s help , imperfect humans cannot be patient to the degree needed .
In a similar manner , there are many factors that are beyond our control as we wait for the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises .
Like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
Micah realized that he could not personally change these conditions .
He tells us : “ As for me , I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah .
To do otherwise ​ — to wait while complaining and grumbling that Jehovah is not acting fast enough — ​ would be displeasing to our God . ​ — Col .
Abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
Why did Abraham need to show patience ?
That was when he and Sarah along with their household crossed the Euphrates River and entered the Promised Land .
Abraham was willing to wait , because his patience was based on his faith in Jehovah .
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
Abraham’s great - grandson Joseph also showed a willingness to be patient .
Did the injustices make Joseph bitter ?
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
5 : 4 , 5 .
He has set the supreme example of being willing to wait .
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
It was their faith in Jehovah and their trust in his dealings with them .
Although Saul was rejected by Jehovah after ruling a little over two years , he was allowed to continue ruling for 38 more years , until his death . ​ — 1 Sam .
What events in Philippi led to the imprisonment of Paul and Silas ?
Paul , a Roman citizen , deserved a proper trial .
In fact , the Jewish worshippers need to gather outside the city gates beside a river .
Is this because there are not even ten Jewish males in the city , the number required to form a synagogue ?
Both he and Silas started “ praying and praising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
Suddenly , there is a violent earthquake .
How quickly everything changed !
Jehovah can do the unexpected , so we need not be anxious in the face of trials .
Let us first discuss Paul’s words recorded at Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
Basically : Do not worry .
Paul was , in effect , saying that “ the peace of God ” is more wonderful than can be imagined .
8 , 9 . ( a ) Even though Paul had suffered an injustice in Philippi , what good resulted because of those events ?
As the brothers in Philippi thought over what had happened in the ten years since those events , they would have been strengthened .
Perhaps because of Paul’s actions , his traveling companion Luke , the physician , was able to remain in Philippi after Paul and Silas left .
In fact , when Paul wrote to those brothers , he was under house arrest in Rome .
1 : 12 - 14 ; 4 : 7 , 11 , 22 .
10 , 11 .
Our confidence in him will be strengthened when we keep in mind that he can “ do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive . ” ​ — Eph .
3 : 20 .
Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
King Hezekiah lived at a time when King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah and captured all the fortified cities , with the exception of Jerusalem .
He approached Jehovah in prayer and turned to Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah for advice .
Granted , we do not expect that Jehovah will miraculously take away all our problems before the promised new world ; nor do we demand that spectacular things occur in our lives .

( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
What will help us to retain “ the peace of God , ” and how is this possible ?
How can we face challenges and still retain “ the peace of God ” ?
Such a relationship is possible only “ by means of Christ Jesus , ” who offered his life as a ransom sacrifice .
What will result when we attain “ the peace of God ” ?
The Scriptures answer by saying that it ‘ will guard our hearts and our mental powers by means of Christ Jesus . ’
We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
That knowledge guards us from becoming overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement .

As told by Pavel Sivulsky
Renounce your activities and go home ! ”
I was born in Ukraine in 1933 in the village of Zolotniki .
Sadly , in 1939 he became very ill , but before he died he told my mother : “ This is the truth . Teach it to the children . ”
When we found someone with a cow to sell , we would mention to that person how amazingly designed cows are .
And we found sheeplike ones !
Furious , the officer threatened to have her locked up for being a Witness , and indeed , in 1952 , Maria was sentenced to ten years in prison .
Many people go to prison but return with their dignity intact . ”
Those words strengthened her .
From 1952 to 1956 , Maria was put to work in a labor camp near the city of Gorkiy ( now Nizhniy Novgorod ) in Russia .
A year later , our daughter Irina was born , but the joy of being with her was cut short .
While in prison , during an interrogation the investigator yelled , “ Soon we will stamp you people out like mice against the floor ! ”
Maria and our daughters , Olga and Irina , in 1965
Once a year Maria traveled to Saransk to visit me , although the journey from Tulun and back took 12 days by train .
They searched everywhere , even in the cows ’ feed .
We also helped to strengthen a small group of publishers in the nearby town of Kurganinsk .
Through the years , there were times when our spirituality weakened .
It was also a serious test for us to serve alongside KGB agents who infiltrated the congregations without our realizing it . They appeared to be zealous and were active in the ministry .
In response , some doctors followed her everywhere in the hospital with a syringe , trying to inject her and induce a premature birth .
We felt the love of our loyal God , Jehovah , of our children , and of the many whom we have been privileged to help find the truth .
Maria and I had the joy of visiting the places where our children served .
We saw the gratitude of those who had been helped by our children to learn about Jehovah .
That decision gave renewed vigor to the preaching work .
Our eldest daughter , Irina , and her family live in Germany .
Our daughter Olga lives in Estonia and regularly calls me .
Before the fall of the USSR in 1991 , there were just over 40,000 publishers .
Today , there are over 400,000 publishers in the countries that were once part of the Soviet Union !
“ Strip off the old personality with its practices . ” ​ — COL .

SONGS : 121 , 142
What makes our worldwide brotherhood unique ?
1 , 2 .
Even so , despite the bitter persecution they endured , adds the author , the Witnesses showed “ dependability and equanimity [ calmness under stress ] ” as well as “ integrity and solidarity . ”
However , on Sunday , December 18 , 2011 , it was a wonderful sight to see over 78,000 of our brothers of different races from South Africa and neighboring countries packed into the largest stadium in the city of Johannesburg to enjoy a spiritual program .
And you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
Such comments by non - Witnesses show that our international brotherhood is truly unique .
It is one thing to strip off the old personality , yet quite another to keep it off .
Sadly , some who once served Jehovah have lowered their guard and have slipped back into their old ways .
6 , 7 . ( a ) How do Paul’s words show that strong measures are needed to strip off the old personality ?
Growing up , she struggled with loneliness and a feeling of emptiness .
Sakura now serves as a regular pioneer and no longer feels lonely .
What are some things that can make us unclean in God’s eyes ?
Nurturing “ uncontrolled sexual passion ” can have what consequences ?
No wonder the practice of viewing pornography has harmful results ​ — such as deep feelings of shame , low productivity in the workplace , unhappy family life , divorce , and suicide .
He relates : “ Slowly , I became addicted .
Notice that Ribeiro had to do more than simply study the Bible to succeed in his struggle .
He says : “ Our family life improved dramatically .
For good reason , the Bible warns against anger , abusive speech , and screaming .
Consider the example of Hans , who serves as an elder in a congregation in Austria .
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
Besides abusive speech , the practice of lying is also a trait of the old personality .
What will be discussed in the next article ?
We have considered a number of bad practices that Christians must strip off and keep off .
No .
In the following article , we will consider several aspects of the new personality that we need to make a permanent part of our figurative clothing .
In what ways can we display compassion and kindness ?
How can we demonstrate humility and mildness ?
Yet , with Jehovah’s merciful help , we can succeed in becoming the sort of person he wants us to be .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
What is one characteristic of the new personality ?
He stated : “ There is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , foreigner , Scythian , slave , or freeman . ”
Arrangements were made for two congregations of different language or race to be together on some weekends .
But after sharing in the preaching work with the white Witnesses and enjoying hospitality in their homes , she exclaimed , “ They are normal people just like us ! ”
As a result of this ongoing arrangement , many brothers and sisters made new friends and are determined to continue to widen out in their associations .
Until Satan’s world comes to an end , we will continue to experience trials .
Our showing compassion and kindness to all in the congregation may lead to what good results ?
How can we show even greater consideration toward foreigners or disadvantaged ones in our congregation ?
We need to befriend such individuals and help them to see that they are a valuable part of the congregation .
Consider what happened to Dannykarl who moved from the Philippines to Japan .
Then he attended a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
He was baptized , and today he serves as an elder .
Give examples of the rewards that come from showing compassion in the ministry .
You get to experience our worldwide brotherhood and see its miraculous unity firsthand . ”
Sakiko , the daughter , relates : “ In the 1990 ’ s , we often met Brazilian immigrants when we were in the field ministry .
When we showed them scriptures from their Portuguese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they paid attention and sometimes even shed tears . ”
( b ) What will help us to remain humble ?
To remain humble , we need to set aside time to meditate daily on what we read in God’s Word .
Jesus even washed the feet of his apostles .
Read Proverbs 22 : 4 .
The apostle Peter stated : “ All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , because God opposes the haughty ones , but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones . ” ​ — 1 Pet .
But by being forgiving , we promote and preserve the unity in the congregation .
Being clothed with mildness and patience is not optional for a Christian .
More important , by means of these qualities , we honor Jehovah and help others to heed the Bible’s counsel . ​ — Gal .
What connection is there between love and impartiality ?
These same qualities make it easier for us to get along with all the brothers and sisters in the congregation .
What is the reward for showing such love ?
It produces united congregations that reflect well on Jehovah and that attract newly interested ones .
LOVE
KINDNESS
Love also involves a feeling of deep affection for others and a sincere concern for them , as well as a warm attachment to them .
On the other hand , a lack of love is revealed by jealousy , pride , indecent behavior , selfishness , and a resentful , unforgiving attitude .
Let us consider how we can do so .
Hence , the Bible counsels us : “ Just as Jehovah freely forgave you , you must also do the same . ” ​ — Col .
But the parent who truly loves his child will be firm when necessary .
Or if you are a parent , you can request that God’s spirit help you to discipline your children , not in anger , but in love .
Second , reflect on how Jesus showed love even when provoked .
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
Yes , if we imitate Jesus , we will always act with love .
In this regard , the Scriptures urge us to develop the same “ mental attitude ” that Jesus had .
Where else but among God’s people can such love be found ?
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
By pursuing peace with others , we demonstrate the depth of our love for them , which is pleasing to our heavenly Father . ​ — Ps .
Additionally , because love is thoughtful , considerate , patient , and kind , it builds affectionate families and united congregations . ​ — Col .
The opening of a branch office in Mexico City in 1929 seemed promising .
The following year saw not one but two conventions held in the country , one in the port city of Veracruz and one in Mexico City .
Hard work in the field began yielding fine results .
Some 1,000 came to Mexico City for the 1941 Theocratic Assembly .
In 1943 the Witnesses put on sandwich signs to advertise the “ Free Nation’s ” Theocratic Assembly held in 12 Mexican cities .
On one occasion , about 90 delegates stayed at the branch , where they had “ as beds 20 cartons of books apiece , in rows . ”
The Yearbook account commented that the grateful guests found these “ beds softer and warmer than the cement floor . ”
For those appreciative Witnesses , gathering in joyful Christian assembly was unquestionably worth all the sacrifices .
That report is as true today as it was back then . ​ — From our archives in Central America .
In the opening chapters of Matthew’s Gospel , Joseph’s name is mentioned eight times , but Mary’s , only four .

Even in the account of her family’s visit to the temple when Jesus was 12 years old , Luke quotes the words of Mary , not those of Joseph .
In the first two chapters of Luke’s Gospel , Mary’s name is mentioned 12 times , but Joseph’s , only 3 .
So , then , Matthew describes more of Joseph’s concerns and activities while Luke gives more details about Mary’s role and experiences .

Today , both Matthew’s and Luke’s genealogical records remain a part of the foundation of our faith and a testimony to the sureness of the promises of God .
34 : 11 - 14 .
Why should you be interested in cultivating self - control ?
First , it has been observed that people who are able to control their impulses generally have fewer major problems .
The failure of Adam and Eve illustrates this truth .
He has been slow to anger and has been just in dealing with Satan’s revolt .
3 : 9 .
What can we learn from Jehovah’s example ?
Jehovah’s exercise of self - control teaches us that we too ought to weigh our words and consider our steps carefully ; we should not rush into things .
No doubt , he took the time to consider what the consequences would be if he were to lower his guard .
And when the situation became critical , he fled from her .
One thing is that we may need to flee from the temptation to break one of God’s laws .
Should you ever face such a test , ask Jehovah to give you the wisdom and self - control to resist .
Many young Christians face a trial like Joseph’s . Consider Kim .
Yet , Kim was wise enough to know that among many youths the temptation to engage in sex is great .
Anyone facing a situation similar to that of Kim would do well to ponder the case of the naive young man described in Proverbs chapter 7 .
Think , too , of the course Amnon took and the terrible outcome of his behavior .
( b ) In what situations must we restrain our emotions ?
On another occasion , Joseph again set a fine example of self - control .
To understand what was in his brothers ’ hearts , Joseph concealed his identity when they appeared before him in Egypt to buy food .
If a fellow Christian or a loved one displays poor judgment , your showing restraint similar to that of Joseph might help you to avoid an impulsive reaction .
What lessons can we learn from accounts concerning King David ?
First , overseers among God’s people need to be especially careful to exercise self - control so that they do not abuse their authority .
Consider this real - life situation .
A vehicle rear - ended Luigi’s car .
A week later , Luigi was making a return visit on a woman and he learned that her husband was the other driver !
In hindsight , Luigi could see how important it was that he had kept calm after the accident and how detrimental it could have been had he lost his temper . ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 6 : 3 , 4 .
Keeping calm or losing our temper can directly or indirectly affect our Christian ministry ( See paragraph 14 )
15 , 16 .
Try to grasp how they apply to you and your family .
No doubt , research in our Christian publications can help you to locate relevant material that will further help you .
How can you help your children to develop self - control ?
Parents know that this quality does not come naturally to young people .
And as is the case with all qualities that their children need to learn , parents should set the example .
Love for God’s authority and respect for his standards are among the most precious things that you can cultivate in your children . ​ — Read Proverbs 1 : 5 , 7 , 8 .
Certainly , whether you are a parent or not , you should not overlook the need to choose your associations wisely .
Spiritually - minded associates will have a positive influence on you , moving you to imitate their course of life marked by self - control .
In what circumstances can you exercise the godly quality of compassion ?
The first ones that he listed were mercy and compassion .
Do you not find it heartwarming that God mentioned these endearing traits ahead of any others ?
This article will focus on the quality of compassion , a sympathetic awareness of another’s suffering or adversity coupled with a desire to lessen it .
When Solomon put them to the test by ordering that the baby be cut in half , the real mother’s compassion was stirred .
Though she realized that the infant she had found was a child of the Hebrews and should not be kept alive , “ she felt compassion for him ” and decided to raise the child as her own . ​ — Ex .
Yet , while humans were created to be compassionate , our imperfection as descendants of Adam inclines us toward self - interest .
What can help you to develop and maintain your interest in others ?
First , take time to examine how Jehovah has shown compassion and how others have shown it .
Think of what God did for Lot .
63 : 7 - 9 ; Jas . 5 : 11 , ftn .
Would we want to leave our brothers out in the cold , so to speak , if there is something that we can do to relieve their suffering ? ​ — Col .
Many experiences could be used to illustrate God’s acts of compassion .
The officer was standing right in front of the family , so all heard the response , “ Just take them out and shoot them ! ”
They had heard of the crisis from others on the bus .
“ Do you think they are just going to let us walk off ? ” his parents asked .
The parents and children were reunited on the other side of the border .
We know from the Bible that there have been times when Jehovah did not directly intervene to protect his servants .
Explain .
He spared the life of Agag , an enemy of God’s people , and he also spared the best of the flock .
Consequently , Jehovah rejected Saul from being king over Israel .
The time is coming when he will execute judgment on all those who refuse to obey him . That will not be the time for him to show compassion for those whom he has judged to be wicked .
Showing compassion for one’s neighbor and Christian brothers is a basic requirement of those who strive to imitate Jesus .
The sufferings of those struck by disasters move many to manifest compassion .
Assist the sick and the elderly .
So we pray for God’s Kingdom to come .
In the meantime , we do what we can to assist those in need .
“ Hats off to these Witnesses , ” he wrote .
Mental - health experts say that practicing compassion can improve your health , well - being , and relationships .
Mother recalled the church creed , which in its original form stated that Jesus descended into hell and was raised on the third day .
This was the beginning of my mother’s interest in the truth .
With my mother , and later with my father
After a few years , he and I began attending meetings with my mother .
In fact , there was a time when she held some of her studies as a group because her students lived quite near to one another .
I am sorry to say that when I was little , I didn’t fully appreciate the truth .
However , when I was about 12 , I became a Kingdom publisher and regularly shared in the field ministry from then on .
Some brothers in our congregation were or had been members of the Bethel family .
I was soon working on a gathering machine , which assembled 32 - page sections of books to get them ready for a machine that sewed the books .

After a couple of years there , I was called to the office of Nathan Knorr , who was then taking the lead in our worldwide work .
133 : 1 .
Starting in 1970 , I was assigned to travel for a few weeks every year or two to visit a number of branch offices of the Watch Tower Society , making what were then called zone visits .
What a delight to visit brothers in over 90 countries !
Livija , the eldest daughter , became a regular pioneer as soon as she finished high school .
She wanted to do as much as she could in Jehovah’s service , so she applied for Bethel and was invited to come in 1971 .
Livija and I have thus been favored with over 40 years together in Bethel service .
Working with Brother Knorr was truly a pleasure .
By that time , I was doing secretarial duties for Milton Henschel , who had worked with Brother Knorr for decades .
The 61 years that I have spent at Bethel have passed quickly .
My parents both died faithful to Jehovah , and I look forward to welcoming them back in a much better world .
Livija and I can truthfully say that during our years in full - time service , “ the joy of Jehovah [ has been our ] stronghold . ” ​ — Neh .
“ Be courageous and strong and go to work .

How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
The building was to be “ exceedingly magnificent , so that its fame and beauty [ would ] be known in all lands . ”
Jehovah directed that Solomon be the overseer of this project . ​ — 1 Chron .
Would his youth and inexperience be an obstacle ?
In his youth , David fought wild animals that carried off his father’s sheep . He displayed tremendous courage when he confronted a battle - hardened giant .
If Solomon did not prove to be courageous , fear could paralyze him , and inactivity would be worse than failure .
Why do we need courage ?
When Israelite spies went to her home in Jericho , she could have given in to fear and turned them away .
Rahab accepted that Jehovah is the true God , and she trusted that somehow he would give the land to the Israelites .
She did not let fear of others , including the king of Jericho and his men , paralyze her .
How did Jesus ’ courage affect the apostles ?

Let us consider two areas of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
Christian youths face many situations in which they need to show courage to serve Jehovah .
Though Christian youths can and should receive guidance from their parents , youths themselves have important decisions to make .
That is because such young ones are going against the will of Satan , the one who taunts God .
* ​ — Read Philippians 2 : 19 - 22 .
( See paragraphs 13 - 17 )
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
Christian parents also need courage .
For instance , some parents may hesitate to encourage their child to pursue a career of pioneering , to serve where the need is greater , to enter Bethel service , or to work on theocratic construction projects .
However , wise parents show courage and put faith in Jehovah’s promises .
A couple in the United States helped their children set spiritual goals .
Having and achieving spiritual goals helps our children to counteract pressures from Satan’s system and to focus on what is real ​ — Jehovah . ”
Older women are a blessing to the congregation . How we love these dear sisters !
She will not scold the sister about her choice of clothing , but she may be able to encourage the younger one to consider how her choice of clothing may affect others .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( b ) How can Philippians 2 : 13 and 4 : 13 help brothers to develop courage ?
Courageous men who are willing to take on more responsibility are a blessing to a congregation .
However , some may be reluctant to reach out .
Perhaps a brother has made mistakes in the past , and now he feels that he is not worthy of being a ministerial servant or an elder .
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
He can humbly ask the elders for training and make himself available to help in whatever way is needed .
With his father’s words impressed on his mind and heart , Solomon did not allow his youth and inexperience to become an obstacle .
As Jehovah helped Solomon , he can help us to be courageous and to accomplish our work , both in our family and in the congregation .
Therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”

How will we benefit from this review ?
The same is true of Hebrew and Greek , the languages that most of the Bible was written in .
Some have felt that they should learn ancient Hebrew and Greek so that they could read the Bible in the original languages .
* Thankfully , the Bible or portions of it have now been translated into nearly 3,000 languages .
Political developments have sometimes influenced which language was the lingua franca , or common language , at any given time . How has God seen to it that such developments do not make his Word unclear to people ?
They were the people initially “ entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God . ”
The Septuagint did much to make the Hebrew Scriptures readable to Greek - speaking Jews and others .
At times , very powerful forces have tried to keep the Bible from the common people .
Of course , they may have heard passages read when they went to church . It is doubtful , though , that they would have understood what they heard .
How would the Bible’s precious treasures be unlocked for them ? ​ — Prov .
Do you have such a desire ?
What was the impact of the Wycliffe Bible ?
Their efforts marked a real turning point , sparking a renewed interest in God’s Word among the people .
Of what are we convinced , and how does this strengthen our faith ?
( Read Isaiah 48 : 17 , 18 . )
Naturally , it is fitting that we respond to Jehovah’s love by loving him in return and by obeying his commandments . ​ — 1 John 4 : 19 ; 5 : 3 .
What will we consider in the following article ?
It is only sensible to conclude that because we appreciate God’s Word , we will want to derive full benefit from it .

How can we meditate effectively ?
In what areas could I improve ? ’
As we prayerfully meditate on God’s Word , we will feel motivated to apply its counsel even more fully .
Indeed , we will to a greater extent unleash its power in our own life . ​ — 2 Cor .
10 : 4 , 5 .
How should we make good use of God’s Word in our ministry ?
What can help us to make good use of God’s Word in our ministry ?
A well - chosen scripture will likely be much more powerful than anything we might say .
Ask yourself , ‘ Do I look for every opportunity to share a portion of God’s Word with those to whom I bring the good news ? ’
We also do well to introduce scriptures in a way that engenders respect for the Bible .
For example , we might say , “ Let’s see what our Creator says on this topic . ”
When speaking with someone from a non - Christian background , we could say , “ Notice what the Holy Writings tell us . ”
9 : 22 , 23 .
He read 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 , which says : “ The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort . . . comforts us in all our trials . ”
They must always make sure that what they teach is solidly based on God’s Word .
If you are assigned to teach from the platform , how can you unleash the power of the Bible in your presentation ?
Then use selected scriptures to teach the points in the outline .
A sister in Australia was deeply affected by the use of scriptures at a Christian meeting .
Even so , she found it a challenge to accept Jehovah’s love for her .
In time , though , she became convinced that God loved her .
How can we show our appreciation for Jehovah’s Word ?
Are we not grateful to Jehovah for his written Word , the Bible ?
Surely , we do well to read God’s Word regularly , apply it in our own life , and use it when helping others .
Meditate on it
Take time to explain , illustrate , and apply verses that you read
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
12 The Truth Brings , “ Not Peace , But a Sword ”
The negative response of unbelieving relatives to the truth can make life difficult for Jehovah’s people .
Why did we accept it , and how did Jehovah bless us ?
My parents suggested that Brother Atkinson have his evening meal with us every night and answer our many Bible questions .
We were invited to attend meetings at a brother’s home a few miles away .
We quickly responded , and a small congregation was formed in Hemsworth .
Soon we were accommodating zone servants ( now known as circuit overseers ) and inviting nearby pioneers for meals .
We had begun setting up a business , but Father said to my brother , “ If you want to go pioneering , we’ll get rid of this . ”
But the courts did not agree , so I was sentenced to 31 days in prison .
The following year when I turned 19 , I registered as a conscientious objector .
Having just served a three - month prison sentence as a conscientious objector , he joined his brother Dennis , a special pioneer , in Hemsworth .
Tension in the area was high , and we had to be very cautious and discerning when talking with people .
“ We need couples with cars , ” Pryce said , “ to engage in a special campaign to distribute the booklet throughout the country . ”
With fellow pioneers on a motorcycle and sidecar
We found a suitable secondhand car and asked the seller to deliver it to us , since none of us could drive .
Next , we needed accommodations .
We had been cautioned to avoid living in a trailer because opposers might set it on fire , so we searched for a home , but in vain .

Arthur had no extra time to prepare his talks , but his readiness to meet challenges in Jehovah’s service was of great encouragement to me .
On May 20 , 2015 , my companion of 66 years passed away in death .
In the last few years , I have felt heartbreak , depression , and grief .
It has also been heartwarming to learn how much Arthur was loved .
I have received letters from friends in Ireland , Britain , and even the United States .
These letters , along with encouragement from Arthur’s brother Dennis , his wife , Mavis , and my nieces Ruth and Judy , have helped me more than words can express .
See the 1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses , pp . 101 - 102 .
LOVE based on right principles ( a·gaʹpe ) is a gift from Jehovah .

According to one reference work , a·gaʹpe “ can be known only from the actions it prompts . ”
After Adam and Eve rebelled , Jehovah made his greatest expression of unselfish love .
How grateful we are for Jehovah’s unselfish love !
What indicates that imperfect humans are able to show unselfish love ?
Does this mean that we cannot express love through our speech ?
Rather , it means that our love must not be limited to words , especially when the circumstances call for action .
9 : 38 .
6 , 7 . ( a ) What is “ love free from hypocrisy ” ?
In the garden of Eden , Satan pretended to be looking out for Eve’s best interests , but his actions were actually selfish and hypocritical .
What will genuine love move us to do ?
In contrast , genuine love moves us to find joy in serving our brothers without fanfare or recognition .
Jesus set the pattern in honoring others by performing the lowliest of tasks .
Why must our commendation be sincere ?
Otherwise , we could actually be flattering the person or avoiding our responsibility to provide needed counsel .
Or suppose a fellow Christian falls into need because of poor planning or fails to thank us for our hospitality .

Make peace .
By “ putting up with one another in love , earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace , ” we can freely forgive those who may not be aware that they offended us .
If we were to harbor resentment or hold a grudge , we would risk permanently damaging our relationship not only with our brother or sister but also with Jehovah .
How should we view privileges in Jehovah’s service ?
Instead of viewing their assignment as an opportunity to get the best seats for themselves and their families , many of these brothers choose to sit in less favorable seats within their assigned section .
By sacrificing their personal advantage in this way , they demonstrate love that is free of any trace of selfishness .
How might you imitate their good example ?

How important is genuine love ?

What is the “ sword ” that Jesus said he would bring ?
( See opening image . )
10 : 34 - 36 .
Of course , Jesus ’ motive was to proclaim God’s message of truth , not to damage relationships .
What have Jesus ’ followers experienced ?
Jesus included the pain of family opposition as part of the suffering that his followers must be willing to endure .
In order to prove worthy of the Christ , his disciples have had to endure ridicule or even alienation from their families .
Likewise , an unbelieving wife should be shown self - sacrificing love and tender affection by her Christian husband . ​ — Eph .
4 : 5 .
Training children can be especially challenging if you have an unbelieving mate .
Focus on his or her good qualities , and express appreciation for your mate .
Instead , explain to them that each person must choose whether to serve Jehovah .
The children’s good conduct might help to draw the unbelieving parent to true worship .
For example , the husband of a Witness wife might not allow her to conduct a formal Bible study with her minor children or to take them with her to Christian meetings .
We should show empathy by trying to see things from their viewpoint and by listening carefully to discern their real concerns .
9 : 19 - 23 .
“ Let your words always be gracious , ” says the Bible .
What are the benefits of maintaining fine conduct ?
Plan ahead .
We would prepare topics to discuss so that we could keep the conversation friendly .
What can help you to cope if a family member leaves Jehovah ?
When a family member is disfellowshipped or he disassociates himself from the congregation , it can feel like the stab of a sword .
How can you cope with the pain that this brings ?
A good spiritual routine can help you to gain control of your thoughts and feelings .
Despite our pain of heart , we must avoid normal contact with a disfellowshipped family member by telephone , text messages , letters , e - mails , or social media .
At this one location , an average of six Bible studies are requested every month
Unless otherwise indicated , Scripture quotations are from the modern - language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA hardly knew how he had found the courage to approach the Roman governor .
What connection did he have with Jesus ?
What was Joseph afraid of ?
Doing so would mean losing his position and his prestige .
Whatever the case , Joseph must have felt wretched about that dreadful perversion of justice ​ — but he could do nothing to stop it !
Indeed , he knew of Jesus ’ death before Pilate did .
If Joseph had witnessed Jesus ’ agony on the torture stake , did that awful scene move him to examine his conscience and finally decide that he ought to take a stand for truth ?
But that is not what Joseph had in mind for Jesus .
Burying Jesus in Joseph’s own future tomb was a generous gesture on Joseph’s part and fulfilled the prophecy that the Messiah would be buried “ with the rich . ” ​ — Isa .
Is there anything to which you give more importance than your relationship with Jehovah ?
The only person specifically stated to have helped Joseph was Nicodemus , who brought burial spices .
1 : 19 , 20 .
How can we do our part in keeping wickedness out of Jehovah’s house ?
1 - 3 . ( a ) What was the situation of Jehovah’s people when Zechariah began prophesying ?
( b ) Why did Jehovah ask his people to ‘ return to him ’ ?
The year 537 B.C.E . was one of rejoicing for Jehovah’s dedicated people .
After 70 long years of captivity , they were freed from Babylon .
At that time the people were “ shouting so loudly that the sound was heard from a great distance . ”
To help his people recall why they were freed from Babylon in the first place , God sent his prophet Zechariah in 520 B.C.E .
Also , what lessons can we today learn from this ?
( Read Zechariah 5 : 1 , 2 . )
Zechariah sees flying through the air a scroll nearly 30 feet ( 9 m ) long and 15 feet ( 4.5 m ) wide !
Read Zechariah 5 : 3 , 4 .
While all of mankind are accountable to Jehovah , his name people are even more so .
Did you notice at Zechariah 5 : 3 , 4 that “ the curse . . . [ would ] enter into the house of the thief . . . and it [ would ] remain inside that house and consume it ” ?
All forms of stealing are offensive to Jehovah .
We view it as an honor to live up to Jehovah’s high moral standard , maintaining conduct that in no way brings reproach on his name .
( b ) What oath did King Zedekiah fail to keep ?
That is exactly what the last king to occupy the throne of Jerusalem did .
Zedekiah swore by Jehovah that he would remain a loyal vassal to the king of Babylon .
King Zedekiah owed it to Jehovah to live up to the oath that he had sworn in God’s name .
How can we prove true to our dedication vow ?
Our full share in worship reveals that we love Jehovah and are truly dedicated to him .
Fulfilling our promise is for our own good ; our faithfulness leads to a secure future . ​ — Deut .
Zechariah’s sixth vision has helped us to see that lovers of Jehovah should not engage in any kind of stealing or make false oaths .
One way he offers help is by giving us the hope that he will soon put an end to all wickedness throughout the whole earth .
After seeing the flying scroll , Zechariah is told by an angel to “ look up . ”
The angel takes swift action , throwing her back into the container and sealing it shut with the heavy lid .
He will see to it that it is contained and speedily removed .
Next on the scene appear two women who have strong wings like those of a stork .
However , the vision also reminded the Jews of their responsibility to maintain the purity of their worship .
Are we moved to keep our “ house ” clean ? Wickedness in any form does not belong in our spiritual paradise .
Rather , Jehovah will gladly bless us .
But how can we be sure that true worship will prevail in this world filled with ungodliness ?
What guarantee do we have that Jehovah will protect his organization as the great tribulation approaches ?
Of what does Zechariah’s final vision assure God’s people ?
Jehovah had guaranteed that he would hold dishonest people accountable for their wicked deeds .
How could the Jews have abandoned their divinely appointed task so quickly ?
They left a land that was familiar to them in order to move to a place most of them had never seen .
If the rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple was not important , they would not have made the difficult journey of some 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) through a harsh land .
Yet , the people took heart .
In addition to the temple work , the Israelites had to rebuild their cities .

God gave Zechariah a final vision to assure the Jews of His love and appreciation for all that they had done so far and to guarantee protection for them if they would return to His work .
Since Jesus ’ enthronement in the autumn of 1914 , both mountains have been present and have played a special role in the fulfillment of God’s will on earth .
Jehovah directed that this shiny metal be used in the construction of the tabernacle and later in the temple in Jerusalem .
The riders of the chariots are angels , likely groups or divisions of angels .
What assignment are they given ?
The chariots and their riders are sent out to care for specific territories .
What assurance can God’s people today draw from Zechariah’s prophecy about the chariots and their riders ?
Ever since spiritual Israel was released from symbolic captivity to Babylon the Great in 1919 , the expansion of true worship has been unstoppable despite relentless opposition .
Why do we not need to fear the coming attack on God’s people ?
Not at all !
12 , 13 . ( a ) What action is Zechariah now told to take ?
Observers must have been intrigued when he placed the crown on High Priest Joshua .
No , Joshua was not from the royal line of David and thus did not qualify to be king .
His crowning was prophetic , pointing to a future and eternal king and priest .
Acting as both King and High Priest , Jesus is the leader of Jehovah’s heavenly army .
Before executing judgment , however , Sprout has a great work to accomplish .
He also appointed a “ faithful and discreet slave ” to take the lead in directing the work in the earthly courtyards of the great spiritual temple .
What reassurance does Jehovah next give the Jews , and how does his message affect them ?
( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
Likewise , the work and the love we show for Jehovah will never be forgotten .
We are part of a stable , secure , and everlasting organization .
As you do so , you can be certain that Jehovah of armies will keep you safe and secure during the remainder of this system of things ​ — and for eternity !

She got out her first - aid kit , cleaned the wound with an antiseptic , and bandaged the finger .
John started to study with the Witnesses , took his stand for true worship , and began serving Jehovah .
Today , John still has a scar on the forefinger of his right hand where he cut himself some 60 years ago .
However , their use became so common in the everyday life of Jesus ’ contemporaries that there was the tendency to reinforce practically any utterance by swearing to it .
5 : 33 - 37 ; 23 : 16 - 22 .
Jesus was not alone in condemning these abuses .
3 Make a Joyful Sound !
For Jehovah’s people , singing has always been an integral part of worship .
13 Imitate Jehovah’s Justice and Mercy
How can you overcome obstacles and sing praises to Jehovah with feeling ?
Faithful worshippers of Jehovah have long used music as a way to praise Jehovah .
The account tells us : “ At the moment when the trumpeters and the singers were praising and thanking Jehovah in unison , and as the sound ascended from the trumpets , the cymbals , and the other musical instruments as they were praising Jehovah , . . . the glory of Jehovah filled the house of the true God . ”
On the most important night in human history , Jesus included the singing of songs after the institution of the Lord’s Evening Meal . ​ — Read Matthew 26 : 30 .
( b ) How should we sing praises to Jehovah , and who should take the lead ?
What if singing is not customary in your family , culture , or environment ?
That , however , should not interfere with your responsibility to sing praises to Jehovah .

What should we remember if fear inhibits us from singing out ?
You should sing as loud as you speak or even louder than that .
( See the suggestions found in Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education , pages 181 to 184 , under the subheading “ Properly Control Your Air Supply . ” )
Then sing the phrase , using the same vibrant voice .
( a ) How can opening our mouth wider help our singing ?
You will not produce a full singing voice unless you make space in your mouth .
So another suggestion is to open your mouth wider than you do for normal speaking .
You can find practical suggestions regarding these problems in Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education , page 184 , in the box “ Overcoming Specific Problems . ”
( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
Use good posture
Sing out
This required removing or revising lyrics that used expressions no longer found in the New World Translation as a result of the 2013 revision .
Further , new songs about our preaching work and songs that express our appreciation for the ransom have been included .
There is a subject index that will be helpful , for instance , when choosing a song for a public talk .
For example , the word “ shall ” is not widely used today , so it has been replaced .
Similarly , the title “ Long - Suffering ” has been changed to “ Exercise Patience , ” and the lyrics have been adjusted accordingly .
( See footnote . )
Surely we want to become familiar with the melodies , rhythms , and lyrics of our songs .
Remember that singing is an important feature of our worship .
It is a powerful way to show our love and appreciation for Jehovah .
When you sing out joyfully , you will also encourage others to sing with confidence .
“ MISERABLE man that I am ! ”
Some Christians who have committed a serious sin have even felt that they are beyond God’s forgiveness .
( a ) How does Psalm 34 : 22 indicate that God’s servants need not be overwhelmed by guilt ?
( See the box “ Lessons or Antitypes ? ” )
Remember , though , that the Law came from Jehovah .
So from the arrangement of the cities of refuge , we learn Jehovah’s view of sin , sinners , and repentance .
First , let us get an overview of the purpose and function of these cities .
Jehovah took seriously all cases of bloodshed in ancient Israel .
How were cases of accidental bloodshed handled in Israel ?
Mercifully , however , he was allowed to flee from the avenger of blood to one of the six cities of refuge . There , he could find protection .
Why is this so important ?
First , the arrangement for elders to handle cases of serious sin comes from Jehovah , as outlined in his Word .
Third , elders are commissioned and trained to reassure repentant sinners , helping to ease their pain and guilt .
Now , I feel that I can approach Jehovah without anything being in the way . ”
Today , Daniel has a clean conscience , and he was recently appointed as a ministerial servant .
An unintentional manslayer had to take action to receive mercy .
He had to flee to the nearest city of refuge .
We cannot imagine the fugitive being indifferent ; his life depended on his reaching that city as soon as possible and remaining there !
He had to leave behind his previous employment , the comforts of home , and the freedom to travel ​ — until the death of the high priest .
Earnest actions to abandon a sinful course show Jehovah that we are not complacent , that we have not presumed on his mercy .
A Christian may need to give up what in order to continue to receive divine mercy ?
He must be prepared to give up even what is dear to him if it would put him in danger of falling into sin .
If certain friends influence you to do things that displease Jehovah , will you cut off association with them ?
If you battle sexually immoral desires , are you avoiding any movies , websites , or activities that may trigger unclean thoughts ?
Nothing stings more than feeling abandoned by him .
Once inside a city of refuge , the fugitive was safe .
What confidence can a repentant Christian have ?
You will never have to see them again . ”
There is no safer place to be !
Beginning in the late 19th century , The Watch Tower drew attention to the prophetic significance of the cities of refuge .
“ Seeking refuge in him by faith , there is protection . ”
Because the Scriptures are silent regarding any antitypical significance of the cities of refuge , this article and the next one emphasize instead the lessons Christians can learn from this arrangement .
That Law came from the most important Person in Jesus ’ life ​ — his Father , Jehovah .
How pained Jesus must have been , then , when he saw the scribes and Pharisees misrepresent his Father’s Law !
In each case , look for ways that you can imitate your heavenly Father . ​ — Read Ephesians 5 : 1 .
( b ) What does this teach us about Jehovah ?
Why ?
Roads leading to the cities of refuge were kept in good repair .
According to Jewish tradition , guideposts were erected to direct fugitives to the cities .
Since the cities of refuge were available , an unintentional manslayer was not forced to flee to a foreign land , where he might be tempted to take up false worship .
Think of it : Jehovah ​ — the very One who had mandated capital punishment for willful murderers — ​ gave unintentional manslayers ample opportunity to receive compassion and protection !
Jehovah is not a heartless judge who is eager to punish his servants .
The Pharisees , in contrast , were reluctant to extend mercy .
Be approachable ( See paragraphs 4 - 8 )
Am I eager to restore peace with someone who has offended me or who has hurt me ? ’
7 : 8 , 9 .
Even so , he had to present his case before the elders , and if his deed was judged accidental , he had to remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest .
This might mean spending the rest of his life there .
How so ?
Proud and selfish , the scribes and Pharisees cared little for the life and welfare of their fellow humans .
Still , neither guilt nor duty moved Paul to preach .
Rather , he loved people , and their lives were precious to him .
Our just God always does what is right and proper . We want to be like him .
Elders in particular strive to be conscious of both their own safety and the safety of those working around them .
First , the elders needed to establish the facts .
To reflect divine justice , they had to determine whether the fugitive acted “ out of hatred ” and “ with malicious intent . ”
( Read Numbers 35 : 20 - 24 . )
Above all , they needed Jehovah’s holy spirit , which would enable them to reflect his insight , mercy , and justice . ​ — Ex .
When Pharisees saw Jesus attending a banquet at Matthew’s home , they asked his disciples : “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
Jesus replied : “ Healthy people do not need a physician , but those who are ill do .
Go , then , and learn what this means : ‘ I want mercy , and not sacrifice . ’
If it has , they will then handle the case according to Scriptural guidelines .
17 , 18 .
( See opening picture . )
Unlike Jehovah and Jesus , elders cannot read hearts .
Finally , endeavor to see the whole person .
Take into consideration a wrongdoer’s background , his motives , and his limitations .
You elders are Jesus ’ undershepherds , and he will help you to judge as he judges .
The cities of refuge , for example , teach elders how to “ judge with true justice , ” and they teach all of us how to “ deal with one another in loyal love and mercy . ”
See “ Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower , September 15 , 2006 , p . 30 .
Yet , there are other sacrifices with which God is well - pleased .
After Samuel was weaned , Hannah took him to the tabernacle , just as she had vowed .
Writing to his Christian brothers in Corinth , Paul said : “ For my part , I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for you . ”
It is also possible for you to send donations directly to a legal entity that is used by Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country where you reside .
Donations of cash with the condition that it can be returned if needed by the donor .
Regardless of the method or methods you would like to use , please first contact the branch office that serves your branch territory to see which avenues are available .
2 : 16 , 17 , 23 .
In this article , we will examine what we can do to prevent such thinking from corrupting our mind .
“ I can be a good person without believing in God . ”
In many countries , it is not unusual to hear people say that they do not believe in God ; they consider themselves to be nonreligious .
( Read Psalm 10 : 4 . )
How could we reason with someone who claims that there is no Creator ?
( Read Jeremiah 10 : 23 . )
So we should not be tempted to think that someone could fully determine what is good without believing in God and adhering to his standards . ​ — Ps .
No wonder an increasing number of people feel that they can be happy without religion !
For example , true worshippers find delight and derive much encouragement from meeting together to worship Jehovah . They also enjoy a united brotherhood , a wholesome lifestyle , and a happy hope .
( b ) Why does God’s Word forbid sex outside marriage ?
“ Why condemn sex outside marriage ? ”
People may say to us : “ Life is to be enjoyed .
13 : 4 .
Therefore , a Christian will avoid looking at pornography or listening to music with immoral lyrics .
Further , we need to control what we think about and talk about . ​ — Eph .
5 : 3 - 5 .
Because many make pursuing a career their main goal in life , a Christian might adopt the same way of thinking .
Is it true that succeeding in a secular career that offers power and prestige leads to lasting happiness ?
Remember that the craving to control others and the longing to be admired are the desires that enticed Satan , but he is angry , not happy .
( a ) How should we view secular pursuits ?
But our secular employment should not be the main thing in our life .
Jesus said : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
This worldly idea may sound appealing to many people .
One report states : “ The reason humanity is getting better is because humans have decided to make the world a better place . ”
Does a comment like that indicate that man is coming to grips with the problems that have plagued him for so long ?
Wars : The two world wars took an estimated 60 million or more lives .
Disease : Some diseases have been controlled .
( a ) Why can only God’s Kingdom solve mankind’s problems ?
War : God’s Kingdom will eliminate such deep - seated causes of war as selfishness , corruption , patriotism , false religion , and Satan himself .
Crime : God’s Kingdom is already teaching millions to love and trust one another as no other government can .
But the law that God gave to the nation of Israel said : “ If a man is found lying down with a woman who is the wife of another man , both of them must die together . ” ​ — Deut . 22 : 22 .
How can we protect ourselves against the enticement of immoral desires ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) God’s servants look forward to what prize ?
They look forward to serving with Jesus Christ in his heavenly Kingdom and sharing with him in bringing mankind to perfection .
The other sheep have a different hope .
3 : 13 .
Immoral desires can be very powerful and can deprive us of spiritual treasures .
At such times , we may yearn for someone who makes us feel needed .
4 : 23 .
10 , 11 . ( a ) Why is jealousy dangerous ?
Korah , Dathan , and Abiram became jealous of Moses and opposed him .
He was not jealous when David was appointed heir to the throne .
Could we be as kind and loving as Jonathan ?
Applying Bible principles can bring peace and happiness to a family and help them to win the prize .
You husbands , keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them .
You fathers , do not be exasperating your children , so that they do not become downhearted . ”
Absolutely not !
How does a Christian man express his love for his wife ?
Husbands are told : “ Keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them . ”
( See paragraphs 13 - 15 )
16 , 17 .
But perhaps it is the way your parents discipline you that upsets you .
Rather than fret over the manner of discipline , try to recognize that there may be a reason for the way they act .
God’s Word says : “ A man of knowledge restrains his words , and a discerning man will remain calm . ”
On the other hand , if you are not moving , how might you make the change easier for newcomers ?
As a tree is removed from the ground , most of its roots are usually cut off to make it easier to transport .
Just as a tree must regularly draw from a water source to remain healthy , a Christian must regularly feed on God’s Word to remain spiritually strong .
“ Whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed . ” ​ — Prov .
Roger , who moved to an area over 1,000 miles ( over 1,600 km ) away from where he lived , says : “ The best way to adapt to a new congregation is to go in field service as often as possible .
“ We exchanged phone numbers , ” she adds , “ so we could be reached and included in spiritual and other activities . ”
“ I am reserved by nature , ” says Rachel , who moved far away from where she grew up .
At that point , you may need to exert yourself to continue to make new friends .
Some trees take longer than others to become firmly rooted in a new environment .
If you moved some time ago but you are still struggling to adjust , applying these Bible principles can help :
“ Let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out . ” ​ — Gal .
Allow more time to adjust than you originally expected .
For example , many Gilead - trained missionaries stay in their foreign assignment for several years before going back to their country of origin for a visit .
He reminded her that she had said exactly the same thing two years earlier ​ — the last time they moved .
7 : 10 .
For example , the brothers in your new congregation may be more reserved or more outspoken than you are used to .
Some newcomers realized to their surprise that their move forced them to ask themselves , ‘ Do I truly love “ the whole association of brothers ” ? ’ ​ — 1 Pet .
2 : 17 .
“ Don’t just tough it out , ” says David , an elder . “ Many things we can do only with Jehovah’s help . Pray about it ! ”
Help them to make new friends by arranging opportunities for upbuilding association .
What can you do to help newcomers who have moved into your congregation ?
What further practical help can you give to newcomers ?
Some names have been changed .
The elders want you to enjoy your new congregation , and they are ready to assist .
Your new field service group overseer should endeavor to share with you in the ministry soon after your arrival .
How should those events and the convictions held by other faithful ones of the past affect your hope ?

Could anything ease her sorrow ?
Why would you like to have the conviction that Martha had ?
Happily , like Martha , you have good reason to say , ‘ I know that my loved one will rise in the resurrection . ’
Those at the girl’s house “ knew she had died . ”
Still , Jesus took her lifeless hand and said : “ Child , get up ! ”
Both Martha and her sister , Mary , were aware that Jesus could cure the sick .
Note that Martha spoke of Lazarus ’ coming back to life in the future , “ on the last day . ”
She had learned of these as a youth at home and at the synagogue .
Up in Zarephath , a Phoenician coastal town , a poor widow showed hospitality to the prophet .
God then miraculously maintained her supply of flour and oil , so that she and her son stayed alive .
That was the first resurrection of Bible record .
7 , 8 . ( a ) Relate what Elisha did to relieve a woman’s grief . ( b ) What does Elisha’s miracle prove about Jehovah ?
The second resurrection related in the Scriptures was performed by Elijah’s successor , the prophet Elisha .
Imagine the mother’s crushing grief .
Later , when Elisha’s body had been reduced to mere bones , an enemy band came into the land .
Then , he said : “ Tabitha , rise ! ”
She came to life right away , and Peter “ presented her alive ” to fellow Christians .
Others became eyewitnesses to another resurrection .
A young man named Eutychus was listening , seated at a window .
In the light of the resurrections discussed , what questions do we need to consider ?
Could they feel as did Martha , who said : “ I know [ my brother ] will rise in the resurrection on the last day ” ?
Just why could she believe that , and why can you ?
There are actually a number of passages in God’s inspired Word that show that Jehovah’s loyal servants knew that a future time of resurrection was in store .
Also , Jehovah said that the blessing would come “ through Isaac . ”
He realized that if a mere tree is cut down , it might sprout again and be like a new plant .
17 , 18 .
No date or length of time was given .
That would be “ at the end of the days . ”
Martha clearly had reason to be confident that her faithful brother , Lazarus , would “ rise in the resurrection on the last day . ”
The promise given to Daniel , as well as the certainty reflected in Martha’s reply to Jesus , should reassure Christians today . There will be a resurrection .
We have seen that actual events in the past prove that a resurrection is possible ​ — the dead can be brought back to life .
How did Psalm 16 : 10 find fulfillment ?
Surely you would stress that Jehovah is the Creator and Life - Giver .
And you would happily add that an earthly paradise is ahead , where God’s people will live forever .
However , we know that Jesus was resurrected .
Yet , what of a promise that a resurrection will occur years , even centuries , in the future ?
Could you rely on such a long - term promise , whether the promise was about someone who just died or one who had been dead for a long time ?
Actually , a resurrection that was promised centuries in advance did take place , and you put faith in it .
Note what else that prophetic psalm said : “ The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone . ” ​ — Ps .
Their rejection was far more than just turning their backs on Jesus or refusing to accept him as the Christ .
How could Jesus become “ the chief cornerstone ” ?
Jesus followed that illustration with a reference to the prophetic statement at Psalm 118 : 22 , which he quoted .
The apostle Peter made a similar connection when speaking to Jewish “ rulers , elders , and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem . ”
It was written over a thousand years in advance , a fact that should reinforce your confidence that a resurrection can occur long after it was foretold or promised .
You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit . ”
We are not left in the dark .
Those listening to Peter knew that .
And the record does not say that any of them disputed Peter’s statement that David “ foresaw and spoke about the resurrection ” of the coming Messiah .
In what way was Psalm 16 : 10 fulfilled , confirming what about the promise of the resurrection ?
( Read Acts 2 : 33 - 36 . )
Later , the apostle Paul drew on the same solid reasoning when speaking to Jews in the city of Antioch in Pisidia .
His argument impressed them , and they wanted to hear more .
Well , Jesus did tell his apostles that there were things they did not and could not know .
Had he not been raised , none of us would have any prospect of seeing our dead loved ones again .
1 : 18 ; 1 Pet .
For them to be thus rewarded , they would first have to die .
Jehovah’s Witnesses have long established Scripturally that since 1914 we have been living during Jesus ’ promised “ presence . ”
Speaking of the heavenly resurrection , the Bible says that those who will experience that will be raised “ each one in his own proper order . ”
Will faithful men of old with leadership abilities come back early to help organize God’s people in the new world ?
What about people who never served Jehovah ?
But , frankly , is there any real need to ponder those issues now ?
We can trust that it will be thrilling to observe personally how Jehovah handles those matters .
What is your hope about the resurrection ?
“ If you go preaching , don’t come back . If you come back , I will break your legs . ”
HOW did that situation come about ?
Life there was simple because it was a time of economic depression .
However , our village was relatively remote , so we were not directly affected by the armed conflict .
I enjoyed reading the Bible , especially the four Gospels .
I explained that it is God’s will that we preach the good news of God’s Kingdom .
The Cruz family invited me to live with them in Angat .
They also encouraged me and their youngest daughter , Nora , to enroll as pioneers .
Nora served in another town , while I continued to support the preaching activity in Angat .
In my third year of pioneering , Earl Stewart , a brother from the branch office , delivered a talk to over 500 people in the public plaza of Angat .
About a dozen single brothers were serving there .
In 1952 , along with six others from the Philippines , I was thrilled to receive an invitation to the 20th class of Gilead School .
Truly , it was quite different from what I had known back in our small village .
For example , we had to learn to use appliances and utensils that were unfamiliar to us .
Then I discovered that it was cold ​ — very cold !
The training at Gilead definitely helped me to improve my spirituality .
To visit some towns , I had to cross the rugged Sierra Madre Mountains .
So the brothers appreciated it when I helped them organize meetings and field service more efficiently .
It was during that assignment that I began to think about Nora , who had started pioneering back in Bulacan .
By this time , she was a special pioneer in Dumaguete City , and I went to visit her .
Over the course of time , I have learned much from serving alongside brothers who care for heavy responsibilities , and Nora has had a variety of assignments at Bethel .
From my vantage point at Bethel , I have been blessed to witness outstanding spiritual growth in the Philippines .
No one did ; one owner even told us : “ Chinese do not sell .
That set off a chain of events that was hard to believe .
I do not have the slightest doubt that Jehovah provides everything we need , no matter what assignment we receive .
How did he respond ?
“ Leaving everything behind , he rose up and began to follow [ Jesus ] . ”
Back when there were just two humans ( and after the Flood , eight ) , Jehovah commanded : “ Be fruitful and become many . ”
What about the use of an IUD ?
This matter was addressed in The Watchtower of May 15 , 1979 , pages 30 - 31 .
The article noted that it was not fully known how such IUDs functioned .
Yet , some evidence suggested that an egg occasionally could get fertilized .
The newly fertilized egg might grow in a Fallopian tube ( an ectopic pregnancy ) or might travel into the womb .
Ending the developing life would be like an abortion .
Two types of IUDs have come to the fore .
In addition , IUDs that release a hormone came on the market in 2001 .
* Moreover , copper - containing IUDs are said to alter the lining of the uterus .
The couple should not expect or allow a third party , not even a physician , to determine what they will do .
It is a private decision .
They should make their decision as a couple interested in pleasing God and maintaining a clean conscience before him . ​ — Compare 1 Timothy 1 : 18 , 19 ; 2 Timothy 1 : 3 .
3 : 15 .
SONGS : 141 , 134
know the holy writings ?
Perhaps you have seen some youths get baptized but later question the wisdom of living by God’s standards .
( a ) Under what circumstances did Timothy become a Christian , and how did he respond to Christian teachings ?
Though at the time Timothy was likely a teenager , he must have applied himself well .
What tools have you found to be effective when you teach your young children ?
How can you help build conviction in your children so that they are persuaded to believe , as Timothy was ?
( Read Romans 12 : 1 . )
Consider an example .
Thomas realizes that there may be a need for many discussions over a period of time .
How can you inculcate God’s Word in your children ?
We can look for what is appropriate to their age and ability .
As they become convinced of what they learn , they will increasingly be able to defend their beliefs before others , including schoolmates .
6 : 6 , 7 .
What is wisdom , and why can we conclude that it is not measured solely by a person’s age ?
It is the opposite of foolishness . ”
The Bible says that “ foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child . ”
Rather , they are making progress in having “ their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong . ”
How can you help your children to acquire it ?
2 : 21 - 23 .
What are the costs ?
Therefore , it is crucial to think these matters through before taking that serious step .
30 : 19 , 20 .
What , though , if your son or daughter begins to express doubts at some point after baptism ?
For example , a baptized adolescent may seem attracted to the things of the world or may begin to question the wisdom of living by Bible principles .
Before doing that , however , make good use of material that Jehovah’s organization has provided for parents .
Your doing so may lay the groundwork for stressing both the seriousness and the blessings of being dedicated to Jehovah and of being a baptized Christian .
It says : “ Don’t hastily conclude that your teen has rejected your faith .
They have more to do with circumstances that make practicing faith a challenge ​ — at least for now . ”
The appendix then provides several suggestions about how a Christian parent might help a youth whose conviction is wavering .
How can parents help their children to become “ wise for salvation ” ?
study guides are excellent tools to help both young ones and adults to understand and explain Bible truths .
“ Just as you have always obeyed , . . . keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling . ” ​ — PHIL .
SONGS : 133 , 135
Why do you treasure your dedication to Jehovah ?
Why is baptism such an important step ?
Although baptism opens the door to many blessings , it also involves responsibility .
In what way ?
It is a solemn promise that you made to Jehovah to love him and to put his will above everything else .
Consider the alternative !
A person who lives apart from Jehovah is under Satan’s rule .
What can man do to me ? ”
1 : 12 - 14 .
In all situations , you can summon the strength ​ — with Jehovah’s help — ​ to live up to your dedication . ​ — Read Philippians 4 : 11 - 13 .
Hence , what steps can you take to work out your own salvation ?
Friendship with Jehovah involves two - way communication ​ — listening and talking .
Other ideas for study can be found in the article “ Young People Ask . . .
Why is prayer vital for a baptized Christian ?
There are millions of brothers and sisters who can assure you that it has helped them .
A teenager named Abigail , who got baptized at age 12 , says : “ I feel that Jehovah deserves our thanks more than anyone else in the universe .
I once heard an excellent reminder : If we woke up tomorrow with only the things we thanked Jehovah for today , what would we end up with ? ” *
Ancient King David , who had been delivered from many grievous trials , expressed these words in song : “ Taste and see that Jehovah is good ; happy is the man who takes refuge in him . ”
But as you grow spiritually , you need to see Jehovah’s hand in your own life .
Some find it difficult to preach to their peers at school . You likely can understand why .
It can be especially challenging when speaking to a large group rather than to a classmate one - on - one .
What can help you ?
Even with preparation , however , you may be hesitant to speak up about your beliefs .
So the way we act can determine how they will respond .
What is involved in your working out your own salvation ?
That , in turn , will move you to speak up about your beliefs . ​ — Read Psalm 73 : 28 .
Clearly , discipleship ​ — including dedication and baptism — ​ is an obligation for you as a Christian .
Yet , it opens the door to countless blessings now and to everlasting life in God’s new world .
You have every reason , then , to keep working out your own salvation !
For more suggestions , see “ Young People Ask ​ — Why Should I Pray ? ”
In helping their children spiritually , why should immigrant parents evaluate the matter of language ?
Parents should consider where the youths will best grasp the truth and progress spiritually , whether in association with a congregation that uses the local language or with one that uses the immigrant’s language .
When Jesus asked Peter : “ Do you love me more than these ? ”
It seems that Jesus was referring to the fish lying nearby and / ​ or the fishing business .
Christians should weigh the place that secular work has in their heart . ​ — w17.05 , pp . 22 - 23 .
Matthew focuses on Joseph , such as his reaction to Mary’s pregnancy and the divine messages to flee to Egypt and later return .

10 Help to Resolve Problems
In other words , some see the Bible as hopelessly outdated .
After all , countless websites and blogs send out a steady flow of the latest advice and guidance .
TV pundits and talk shows feature a stream of knowledgeable psychologists , lifestyle gurus , and authors .
With all that up - to - the - minute information available , why turn to the Bible ​ — a book that was completed almost 2,000 years ago ?
It offers to guide us in every aspect of life and to equip us for any challenge that matters .
The Bible itself says : “ The word of God is alive . ” ​ — Hebrews 4 : 12 .
Some have great chunks missing .
It is a very ancient book ​ — older than most .
Their medical counsel often seems more dangerous than helpful .
The writing of it began over 35 centuries ago , yet the Bible is intact .
“ Happy are the peacemakers , since they will be called sons of God . ”
“ If possible , as far as it depends on you , be peaceable with all men . ” ​ — Romans 12 : 18 .
“ Guard against every sort of greed , because even when a person has an abundance , his life does not result from the things he possesses . ”
“ We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ”
The Bible does not merely list those values .
So you may reason : ‘ If the Bible really is practical , should it not produce results in my life ?
Suddenly , though , she suffered a series of tragic losses .
Consider how Biblical wisdom has helped people to avoid some of life’s hardest problems before they became entrenched .
Delphine , mentioned in the preceding article , felt that her anxieties were pushing her toward overdrinking .
Much of this trouble could be avoided if people followed the Bible’s wise advice .
Each night when I felt my thoughts racing and anxiety rising , I petitioned Jehovah .
Few problems cause as much heartbreak and misery .
Samuel found that he was accused of flirting so often ​ — even when he did not intend to — ​ that he finally decided to go ahead and flirt on purpose .
Samuel realized that his flirting was neither pure nor right .
That , in turn , has helped him to avoid even worse troubles .
Clearly , the Bible provides practical advice that can help us avoid serious problems .
Some of life’s problems tend to persist , sometimes for years ; they may take root before we are fully aware of them .
Rosie says , “ I got hung up on certain worries by making things worse in my mind or imagining the worst - case scenarios . ”
One of them is Matthew 6 : 34 : “ Never be anxious about the next day , for the next day will have its own anxieties .
Yasmine too sensed her anxiety taking control over her .
“ I would cry a couple of days during the week , and I couldn’t sleep some nights .
I felt as if a big weight had been lifted off of my shoulders .
A young woman named Isabella says : “ I think procrastination is genetic because my dad has it too .
Says Isabella , “ I didn’t want Jehovah to be ashamed of my work just because I procrastinated . ”
“ My husband walked out on our marriage , leaving me with four young children , ” relates Kirsten .
Kirsten reached out to others who serve Jehovah as she does .
One scripture that helped her was Psalm 68 : 6 : “ God gives those who are alone a home to dwell in . ”
She explains : “ I knew that the verse could not just mean a home in a physical sense now .
Rather , I came to understand that God offers us a spiritual home , a place of real safety that provides genuine connections and emotional attachment to others who love Jehovah .
Then I made a list of activities that I could enjoy with others , so that I could form connections with them that were based on spiritual values .
However , can Bible principles also help with problems that cannot be solved today , such as chronic health issues and grief ?
For example , if you have lost a loved one in death or if you face a chronic illness , you may have no choice but to find ways to cope with your pain .
Can the Bible help in such dire situations ?
Rose says : “ I have a genetic disorder that causes me severe and constant pain .
When Rose is saddened over being unable to do what she once could , she finds comfort in the words recorded at 2 Corinthians 8 : 12 : “ If the readiness is there first , it is especially acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what a person does not have . ”
In time , she came to liken herself to a child’s crayon ​ — even the broken ones are still useful for coloring .
“ Without exception , ” she found , “ they were all people of prayer . ”
Our next ‘ date ’ is already scheduled , as if it were on my Father’s calendar .
Many such recordings are available on the website jw.org .
The Bible’s answer is clear .
BY GIVING US STRENGTH :
But Jehovah “ gives power to the tired one and full might to those lacking strength . ”
The apostle Paul , who endured serious trials , said : “ For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power . ”
BY GIVING US WISDOM :
Although the sun has long since set , you do not feel hopelessly lost , for you have in your hand a powerful flashlight .
In some ways , the Bible is like such a flashlight .
But the Bible does more . It also provides an illuminating view of the future , enabling us to see and follow a path that leads to lasting happiness and contentment .
Take , for example , this Bible principle : “ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ”
One author noted : “ It is virtually impossible to give yourself away without getting back more than you give ​ — provided you give away with no thought of any reward . ”
His Word encourages us to give him the praise , honor , and obedience he deserves .
Because he cares for us and wants us to benefit ourselves by following his guidance .
The Bible also teaches us to build a friendship with our Creator .
At times we may doubt whether it is truly possible to be friends with the almighty Creator .
Seek his help to understand the Scriptures .

WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
God wants to be our Friend . ​ — James 4 : 8 .
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
But long before that ​ — in the eighth century B.C.E . ​ — the Bible writer Isaiah referred to “ the circle of the earth , ” using a word that may also be rendered “ sphere . ” ​ — Isaiah 40 : 22 ; footnote .
That view prevailed for many centuries .
By the 18th century C.E . , scientists were accepting the idea that stars and planets might hang in a void .
Not until the plagues of the Middle Ages did medical doctors learn to apply this principle , which is still deemed effective . ​ — Leviticus , chapters 13 and 14 .
3 They Offered Themselves Willingly ​ — In Madagascar
When we feel overwhelmed by the pressures of life , what can we do ?
This article will consider why and how we benefit from honoring Jehovah with our valuable things .
27 See the Difference in People
The first of these articles discusses how true happiness comes from loving God and not from the counterfeit types of love so evident in “ the last days . ”
Louis and Perrine , a couple in their 30 ’ s , moved from France to Madagascar .
I was anxious about leaving behind our family , congregation , apartment , all the familiar places , and our routine .
When Didier and Nadine , a couple from France , moved to Madagascar in 2010 , they were middle - aged .
Their words encouraged us to make the move .
For Didier and Nadine , learning the Malagasy language was a challenge .
“ I was conducting a congregation meeting but did not understand any of the answers given by the brothers and sisters .
All I could say was , ‘ Thank you . ’
I quickly called on a brother who gave the right answer ​ — at least , I hope he did . ”
At a convention in 2005 , Thierry and his wife , Nadia , watched the drama “ Pursue Goals That Honor God . ”
Says Thierry : “ At the conclusion of that drama , while we were applauding , I leaned over to my wife and asked , ‘ Where are we going ? ’
Soon thereafter , they began to take steps to reach their goal .
Riana giving a talk in the Tandroy language
Yet , after studying the Bible , he changed his mind .
He moved in with a pioneer brother , got a part - time job , and began to pioneer .
He says , “ It was the best decision I ever made . ”
However , Riana’s relatives did not understand why he did not pursue a secular career .
He relates : “ My father , uncle , and grandaunt all encouraged me to pursue higher education .
That burglary made me reflect on Jesus ’ words about storing up ‘ treasures in heaven . ’

He moved to the southernmost part of the country ​ — a drought - stricken region 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) from where he had been living .
That region is home to the Antandroy people .
He says , “ I prayed to Jehovah to help me move to the Tandroy - speaking region . ”
He could not get a job .
Consider Sylviana , mentioned in the introduction to this article .
Remember , she feared that being a need - greater would be beyond her abilities .
May many more willing workers start that training soon !
17 : 17 ; 25 : 25 .
19 : 29 .
40 : 31 .
What pressures must we deal with , but what reason does Jehovah have to be pleased with his faithful servants ?
( See opening pictures . )
Others , although well along in years themselves , are caring for elderly relatives .
Still others are struggling to provide , not luxury items , but just the basic necessities for their families .
What encouragement can we draw from Isaiah 40 : 29 , but what serious mistake could we make ?
( a ) How can we frustrate Satan’s goal to weaken us ?
The lesson for us ?
And the psalmist assures us : “ Jehovah is aware of what the blameless go through . ”
How can we be sure that Jehovah is able to strengthen us ?
Jehovah is the Source of dynamic energy .
A sister whom we will call Kayla has had to battle with chronic fatigue syndrome , depression , and migraine headaches .
What did the apostle Paul mean when he wrote : “ When I am weak , then I am powerful ” ?
Read Isaiah 40 : 30 .
No matter how qualified we may be , we are limited in what we can accomplish in our own strength .
Paul realized that there was only so much he could do without help from a higher source .
But why do such differences arise ?
Still , He did not intervene .
39 : 21 - 23 .
The most important reason to “ let go ” of anger is to imitate Jehovah , who “ has not dealt with us according to our sins . ”
And at times a fit of anger may be followed by a prolonged period of depression .
On the other hand , “ a calm heart gives life to the body , ” says the Bible .
But when a fellow believer or a family member says or does something that hurts us deeply , we may be devastated .
Suppose we cannot simply forget the incident . Will we allow resentment to fester for years ?
Remember , he is one of Jehovah’s friends .
Do not assume that your brother set out deliberately to hurt you ; give him the benefit of the doubt .
And be open to the possibility that in some way you may have contributed to the rift .
You might begin the conversation by saying something like this , “ Perhaps I am being overly sensitive , but when you spoke to me yesterday , I felt . . . ”
If the discussion does not produce the results you desire , look for another opportunity to make peace .
What means can Jehovah use to help us recover when we have committed a sin , and why should we take advantage of the provision ?
Do not delay ​ — your everlasting future is at stake !
So take Jehovah at his word , and accept his forgiveness ! ​ — Isa .
55 : 6 , 7 .
Be assured , however , that the One who “ gives power to the tired one and full might to those lacking strength ” can give you whatever you need to carry on .
During 2018 , we will be reminded of this important truth every time we attend a meeting at the Kingdom Hall .
“ How good and how pleasant it is . . . to dwell together in unity ! ” ​ — PS .
SONGS : 18 , 14
motivate us to promote unity ?
ON March 31 , 2018 , as the sun begins to set , God’s people and many interested ones will assemble for the annual observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal .
If so , when ?
When we show by our actions that meetings for worship are important to us , we give Jehovah added reason to keep our name in his “ book of remembrance ” ​ — “ the book of life ” — ​ in which the names of those who are in line to attain to everlasting life are inscribed . ​ — Mal .
( Read 2 Corinthians 13 : 5 . )
Am I doing my utmost to preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom ?
In the weeks prior to the Memorial , he rereads these articles and meditates on the importance of this observance .
This elder has found that by rereading these articles and by reading and meditating on the Memorial Bible reading , he learns new things each year .
Most important , he feels that his love for Jehovah and Jesus deepens each and every year .
Such a study project may help you to deepen your love and appreciation for Jehovah and Jesus and thus may help you to benefit more fully from the Memorial .
On the night of the first Lord’s Evening Meal , Jesus prayed that his followers would all be united and that they would enjoy the same unity that he and his Father treasure .
The Memorial , like no other meeting of God’s people , provides undeniable evidence of the unity of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Jehovah , in fact , foretold it .

The precious unity described in Ezekiel is clearly evident each year as the anointed remnant and the “ other sheep ” gather to observe the Memorial of Christ’s death !
If we are lowly in heart , we will not give in to the worldly spirit of self - exaltation .
How does proving ourselves to be peacemakers promote unity ?
Am I known for going out of my way to promote peace and unity ? ’
How can we show that we are “ putting up with one another in love ” ?

SONGS : 80 , 50
As a result , “ they lacked nothing . ”
What do we show Jehovah when we support his work ?
We give to Jehovah because of our love and appreciation for him .
When explaining the needs of the upcoming project to build the temple , King David acknowledged that everything we receive comes from Jehovah and that whatever we give to Jehovah is from what he has already given us . ​ — Read 1 Chronicles 29 : 11 - 14 .
Likewise today , unselfish giving in appreciation for and in support of the work of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization is a fundamental aspect of worship .
It is healthy for us to be generous givers and not just receivers .
Though the parents may not expect this , they may accept these gifts because it is a way for the child to show appreciation for all that they do for him .
For example , Moses called for donations for the construction of the tabernacle , as did King David for the building of the temple .

Similarly , Jesus and his apostles later benefited from the generosity of the women “ who were ministering to them from their belongings . ” ​ — Luke 8 : 1 - 3 .
What were some sources of contributions in times past ?
10 , 11 . ( a ) How can we imitate the generous servants of Jehovah in Bible times ?
We may be made aware of financial needs with regard to renovations to our local branch office , a convention we are attending , or assistance to our brothers after a natural disaster .
Most donations are anonymous .
Our brothers , even those who are in poor economic situations , are like the Macedonians who were in “ deep poverty ” and yet begged for the privilege to give and did so generously . ​ — 2 Cor .
How does the organization strive to make the best use of donated funds ?
Ezra considered these funds to be voluntary offerings to Jehovah and put detailed procedures in place to protect these treasures on the perilous journey through hostile territory .
In recent years , there have been many exciting new initiatives .
Your donations help our worldwide work ( See paragraphs 14 - 16 )
14 - 16 . ( a ) What are some of the things being accomplished with your donations ?
( b ) In what ways have you benefited from these provisions ?
Many longtime servants of Jehovah have been heard to say that they have never seen a time like this with so many spiritual provisions .
The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures is published in many more languages .
Those who attended were thrilled to be present .
But as soon as we watch the various programs on JW Broadcasting , we remember that we are part of an international brotherhood .
After touring one of our printing facilities , an executive from a large company was amazed that all the work was accomplished by volunteers , with voluntary donations , and without any sales or fund drives .
( a ) What blessings do we receive when we give in support of the Kingdom ?
Jehovah promises that the one who gives generously will prosper .
By word and example , we have the privilege of training our children and new ones to appreciate how they can have a share and how they , as a result , can enjoy many blessings .
Everything we have is from Jehovah .
Giving back to him shows that we love him and appreciate all that he has done in our behalf .
May we likewise continue to find joy and satisfaction in giving back to Jehovah what has come to us from his own hand .
“ Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah ! ” ​ — PS .
As the Bible foretold , Jehovah is gathering “ a great crowd . . . out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues . ”
Those gathered constitute “ a mighty nation ” of more than eight million happy people who “ are rendering [ God ] sacred service day and night . ”
Pursuing selfish goals does not bring people the happiness that they expect .
However , we cannot avoid all contact with such people .
So how can we turn away from the worldly attitudes that surround us and strive to please Jehovah , the God of love ?
Doing so will help us evaluate and refine the love that we should show , the kind of love that brings true satisfaction and happiness .
“ Men will be lovers of themselves , ” wrote the inspired apostle .
No , it is normal , even necessary , to have a healthy love of self . Jehovah designed us that way .
A man who loves his wife loves himself , for no man ever hated his own body , but he feeds and cherishes it . ”
It is a distorted , selfish love .
( Read Romans 12 : 3 . )
In contrast , people who love God produce a much different kind of fruitage .
How can we avoid becoming lovers of ourselves ?
( See paragraph 7 )
Am I genuinely seeking to do God’s will ?
But what could make us happier than knowing that we have the approval of the Sovereign of the universe ?
Love of God has moved some to give up potentially lucrative careers to serve Jehovah more fully .
Some years ago , a pioneer in Ireland spoke to a man about God .
6 : 9 , 10 .
Absolutely !
( Read Ecclesiastes 5 : 12 . )
You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
Does making money come first in my life ?
Do I really trust in Jehovah to care for my needs ? ’
What is a reasonable view of pleasures ?
As foretold , many people today are “ lovers of pleasures . ”
Just as there is nothing wrong with a healthy , reasonable view of self and money , there is nothing wrong with a balanced view of pleasures .
Jehovah does not want us to practice severe self - denial or to abstain from wholesome activities that bring enjoyment .
One scholar wrote : “ This [ verse ] definitely does not mean that they also love God to some extent .
16 , 17 .
At the wedding , he miraculously changed water into wine , adding to the supply , which had run short .
After some 6,000 years of human misery , Satan’s world is coming to its end .
146 : 5 .
The love of God flourishes among Jehovah’s people , and our ranks are growing every year .
the way we relate to others ?
What challenge faces God’s people today ?
MANY health - care professionals work among those infected with contagious diseases .
This presents a challenge for us .
These last days are a time of moral chaos .
The apostle Paul’s second letter to Timothy describes the characteristics of people who are alienated from God , characteristics that will become more pronounced in the days ahead .
( Read 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 , 13 . )
To whom does the list of qualities found at 2 Timothy 3 : 2 - 5 apply ?
How would you describe those who are puffed up with pride ?
People with such traits crave to be admired and adored .
Jehovah certainly detests pride .

Later , King Hezekiah too fell prey to haughtiness , though only temporarily . ​ — 2 Chron .
What will help us to show humility ?
Like David , Jehovah’s people today strive to show humility .
We also know that love “ does not brag , does not get puffed up . ”
3 : 1 .
( a ) How is disobedience to parents viewed by some today ?
Paul described how people living in the last days would relate to one another .
By speaking positively about their parents , young ones can help other youths view their own parents in a positive light .
( b ) To what extent do true Christians love their fellow man ?
People would also be disloyal .
*
Such Christian love would even be extended to one’s enemies . ​ — Matt .
He preached to all his relatives , and just six months after the convention , he gave his first Bible reading at the Kingdom Hall .
To analyze how well we are doing in showing love for others , we might ask ourselves : ‘ Am I reaching out to help others in my family , in my congregation , and in my ministry ?
What animalistic qualities do many display , but how have some changed for the better ?
Godless ones would be without love of goodness , or as some translations render the expression , “ haters of good ” or “ hostile to all goodness . ”
( See paragraph 16 )
There are many who were once as fierce as wolves but who now live in peace with others .
As people learn about God , they see the need to conform to his standards .
How may we avoid being influenced by those who display ungodly qualities ?
But we can avoid being drawn into their thinking and imitating their characteristics .
We do this by strengthening our spirituality through Bible study and close association with those who are determined to serve Jehovah .
We should also strive to help others spiritually .
Look for opportunities to witness , asking Jehovah to help you say the right thing at the right time .
8 : 23 .
The Greek word for “ slanderer ” or “ accuser ” is di·aʹbo·los , a term used in the Bible as a title for Satan , the wicked slanderer of God .
It was found near Ashdod .
I am innocent of any offense . . . .
If the governor does not consider it his obligation to have your servant’s garment sent back , do it out of pity !
You must not remain silent when your servant is without his garment . ”
3 Imitate the Faith and Obedience of Noah , Daniel , and Job
What enabled them to remain faithful and obedient ?
28 Joy ​ — A Quality We Acquire From God
If so , take courage from the examples of Noah , Daniel , and Job .
They were imperfect , and they faced many of the challenges we face , including some that were life threatening .
Challenges that Noah faced .
They were even saying “ shocking things ” against Jehovah .
He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries .
Noah walked with the true God . ” ​ — Gen .
For one thing , Noah did not walk with God in that wicked pre - Flood world for a mere 70 or 80 years ​ — the life span of many today .
It stands to reason , therefore , that Noah faced ridicule and opposition , perhaps even threats of violence .
Rather , he had the courage that Jehovah gives to his faithful servants .
And he continued to do so for another 350 years after the Flood .
We do so by upholding God’s righteousness , by being no part of Satan’s world , and by keeping Kingdom interests in first place .
To be sure , our way of life does not win us the world’s approval .
Indeed , even now , our firm stand for God’s laws , such as those concerning marriage and sexual morality , has led to negative publicity in some lands .
Like Noah , however , we fear Jehovah , not men .
4 : 6 , 7 .
Challenges that Daniel faced .
Daniel lived as a captive in Babylon , a city filled with idolatry and spiritism .
How this must have hurt faithful Jews like Daniel !
A more subtle challenge for Daniel could have involved his exceptional abilities , which led to his receiving special privileges .
How may Daniel have been a blessing to his fellow Jews ?
* Imagine how comforting it must have been for the Jewish captives , including Ezekiel , to see Jehovah’s hand in matters in this way !
How we can imitate Daniel’s faith and obedience .
Like Daniel , therefore , let us draw close to Jehovah , our God .
Despite the wickedness that prevailed in Judah during Daniel’s early childhood , the boy grew to love God .
So parents , do not give up on your children , but teach them patiently .
16 , 17 .
The cause , we know , was the slanderer Satan , who lyingly accused Job of worshipping God out of self - interest .
During that time , he continued to give Jehovah exclusive devotion .
How can we be sure ?
No matter what our circumstances may be , let us always keep Jehovah at the center of our lives , trusting him fully and obeying him with a complete heart .
How do the words at 1 Peter 5 : 10 reflect what occurred in the lives of Noah , Daniel , and Job ?
Through Peter’s inspired words , Jehovah assures us that he will make his servants firm and strong .
All of us desire to be made strong by Jehovah and to remain firm in our worship .
In fact , they ‘ understood everything ’ he required of them .
Noah ?
A similar thought is expressed at Proverbs 2 : 7 , 9 , which says that Jehovah “ treasures up practical wisdom for the upright . ”
How did Noah become familiar with God’s purpose for mankind ?
* Perhaps from these men and possibly from their wives , Noah learned about mankind’s start , God’s purpose that a righteous human family fill the earth , and the rebellion in Eden ​ — the results of which Noah could see for himself .
6 : 9 .
How did hope reinforce Noah’s faith ?
3 : 15 .
Accurate knowledge gave Noah faith and godly wisdom , which protected him from harm , especially spiritual harm .
Hence , he must have known that sexual unions between women and materialized spirits were both unnatural and wrong .
That spirit fosters a love for violence and immorality .
Daniel was evidently well - instructed by his parents , who taught him to love Jehovah and his written Word .
Godly wisdom helped him to grasp the principle of relative subjection to secular authorities .
Daniel could have made excuses , saying , ‘ Thirty days is not forever ! ’
Hence , we need to meditate on what we read .
Also important is regular heartfelt prayer , especially when we face trials or other challenging situations .
How did Job gain an accurate knowledge of God ?
How accurate knowledge of God benefited Job .
He truly knew Jehovah , and he acted on that knowledge .
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
He viewed marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman .
5 : 28 ; 19 : 4 , 5 .
Your answers may help you to see how well you know Jehovah .
They thus became examples of righteousness , and they led truly successful lives .
And you will act with insight and wisdom in today’s ungodly world . ​ — Prov .
2 : 4 - 7 .
The same could be said of Noah . He had just one wife , even though polygamy began to be practiced soon after the rebellion in Eden . ​ — Gen .
PEACE
KINDNESS
Even servants of God may become discouraged and see their joy slip away .
To answer that question , we first need to understand what genuine joy is and how others have remained joyful despite trials .
However , when he sobers up , he laughs no more , and he may return to a life full of sorrow and troubles .
His momentary exuberance was not true joy . ​ — Prov .
For example , the apostles were flogged for speaking about the Christ .
Obviously , they were not rejoicing over the flogging they had received .
27 : 11 .
Despite such pressures , Abraham maintained joy in his heart .
He had clearly in mind his hope of living in the new world under the Messiah’s rule .
For instance , in November 2013 , Super Typhoon Haiyan ripped through the central part of the Philippines , destroying the homes of over 1,000 Witness families .
We also treasure the gift of life and our ability to enjoy it .
On the other hand , the majority of mankind have no clear concept of life’s purpose .
For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit . ”
Consider what else Jehovah has done for his people .
If we meditate on all these blessings from God , we will see our joy deepen and grow . ​ — Phil .
You must feed the fire to intensify the heat .
That is what a researcher at the University of Nebraska in the United States wrote after reviewing a number of studies on health .
We also increase our joy as we reflect on our current blessings , imitate the faith of others , and seek to do God’s will .
6 : 8 .
Be reasonable with yourself and others . ​ — Phil .
4 : 5 .

MEMORIAL ATTENDANCE ( 2016 )

As told by Beishenbai Berdibaev
Talking to the Witnesses in those days was risky , but what we later learned from Apun transformed our lives .
I was born in 1937 on a kolkhoz , or collective farm , near Tokmok , Kyrgyzstan .
Our family belong to the Kyrgyz people , and we speak the Kyrgyz language .
Teskey Ala - Too mountain range
As a young man , I gave little thought to the purpose of life or to the future .
Why ?

Hence , they were persecuted as enemies of the Communist state .
Twice he served three - year sentences for upholding neutrality ; then he spent a further ten years in prison plus five years in exile .
Because she was skilled in her craft , such professionals as doctors and teachers ordered clothes from her .
Elizabeth answered her questions straight from the Bible .
Nikolai Chimpoesh
You have nothing to fear . ” ​ — Matt .
Mairambubu comes from the Naryn Region of Kyrgyzstan .
One day in August 1974 , she visited my sister’s home , which is where we first met .
She gave her name , Apun , but she was cautious because even in the 1980 ’ s , the activities of the Witnesses were banned .
“ A woman told me that soon people will no longer die .
Even wild beasts will be tamed . ”
To me , it sounded like a fairy tale .
Apun visited us three months later .
After several preaching trips to Balykchy , we discovered widespread interest there .
This was clearly an opportunity to expand our ministry .
Demand for our publications rose dramatically .
Those years of traveling between Tokmok and Balykchy cost a lot of money .
A Christian brother regularly gave us money to make up for the shortfall .
In our home congregation of Tokmok , new avenues of service opened up .
One of these young people with whom we studied now serves on the Branch Committee , and two others are special pioneers .
Mairambubu and I were also kept busy raising our growing family .
And our children loved memorizing Scripture texts .
In this way our children , and later grandchildren , were very much involved in congregation activities .
The dear brothers and sisters who started Jehovah’s work in our area in the 1950 ’ s would be astounded to see the changes we have experienced .
Publishers spent a week cleaning the stadium beforehand .
The director was so impressed that he allowed us to use the facilities without cost .
Literature is now regularly translated into Kyrgyz by a translation team at the branch office in Bishkek .
The organization has grown , and we now number well over 5,000 publishers .
Yet , Jehovah used me to serve as an elder and to teach precious Bible truths to people who were more educated than I was .
My own experience moves me to continue loyally testifying about Jehovah , with whom “ all things are possible . ” ​ — Matt .
“ May [ God ] grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had . ” ​ — ROM .
A brother in Brazil states , “ Our 23 years of marriage have been very happy ​ — thanks to our efforts to be spiritually - minded . ”
( 1 ) What does it mean to be a spiritual person ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
On the other hand , “ the spiritual man ” is someone who “ examines all things ” and who has “ the mind of Christ . ”
Consider first the attitude of a physical individual .
As a result , the majority of them do what feels right in their own eyes and make no effort to live up to God’s standards .
In contrast with fleshly - minded individuals , they try to bring all their ways into harmony with Jehovah’s standards .
Similarly , someone who keenly values spiritual or religious interests is called spiritually - minded .
Why is effort needed to develop and maintain spirituality ?
If a person loses his spirituality , he creates a moral vacuum and the polluted “ air ” of this world will rush in .
( a ) What can help us to grow spiritually ?
She was clearly interested in God’s purpose in connection with the Messiah .
Yet , of all the people who have lived , who is the most outstanding example of a spiritual person ?
It is Jesus , of course .
( Read Isaiah 63 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
( b ) Relate an example .
Rachel , a sister in Brazil , says : “ I loved to follow the world’s fashions .
( b ) How can we expose our mind to “ the mind of Christ ” ?
Jesus ’ mind is focused on his relationship with God .
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
How can we do this ?
By reading and meditating on the Bible books of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , we expose our mind to Christ’s mind .
Finally , we have learned how having “ the mind of Christ ” helps us to grow as a spiritual person .
What did one brother find lacking with regard to his spiritual condition , and what did he do about it ?
His wife , a spiritually strong person , had no problem answering the questions , but Robert found himself constantly embarrassed , not knowing what to say .
( b ) What key points will we now discuss ?
To help us to continue progressing , we will answer three key questions in this article : ( 1 ) What will help us to analyze the true state of our spirituality ?
To whom does the counsel found at Ephesians 4 : 23 , 24 apply ?
We are told to “ continue to be made new in [ our ] dominant mental attitude . ”
Is my personality becoming Christlike ?
If you have already finished studying that book , can you move on to other study materials that can help you to stabilize your faith ?
At the same time , we work to reject things that will hinder our spiritual growth . ​ — Titus 2 : 11 , 12 .
As a youth , ask yourself : ‘ Am I participating in spiritual activities just because my parents expect me to ?
Having such goals will help all of us as Jehovah’s servants to deepen our spirituality . ​ — Eccl .
( b ) How can the apostle Peter’s example and counsel help us ?
( c ) What can you do to cultivate spirituality ?
With the spirit’s help , we can gradually begin to think more and more as Christ did .
If we find that our mind pushes us toward materialistic thinking or fleshly desires , we should not give up .
Gradually , with Jehovah’s help , Peter developed Christlike thinking .

A godly person will not mix with those who could endanger his spirituality .
What questions could help you to make practical application ?
Any pursuits that are spiritually dead , vain , or fruitless .
Why should I not join worldly reform movements ? ’
How does Paul’s counsel to the congregation in Rome help us in dealing with disputes ?
Why do you want to move forward spiritually ?
AS THE boat steamed up the Belfast Lough , a sea inlet , the little cluster of passengers standing on deck caught sight of green hills bathed in early morning light .
The advertised public talk , “ The Overthrow of Satan’s Empire , ” drew an “ intelligent audience of about 300 ” later that evening .
O’Connor , secretary of the YMCA ​ — attempted to turn the audience of more than 1,000 against the Bible Students .
What happened ?
After the public talk in Dublin , a renowned theologian brought along by O’Connor received Scriptural answers to his questions , much to the audience’s enjoyment .
On the next day , the travelers caught the fast mail boat to Liverpool and boarded the famed Lusitania for New York .
Public talk advertised in The Irish Times , May 20 , 1910
That verse says that Esau did “ not appreciate sacred things ” and “ gave up [ to Jacob the ] rights as firstborn in exchange for one meal . ”
However , a review of Bible accounts shows that a man did not need to be a firstborn son to be an ancestor of the Messiah .
Each man seems to have been a firstborn .
This is not to say that being firstborn was of no importance .
He was also the son who inherited a double portion of property . ​ — Gen .
But the right of firstborn could be transferred .

23 Discipline ​ — Evidence of God’s Love
Ecclesiastes 12 : 1
What do Christian parents want to be sure of before their children get baptized ?
Blossom Brandt thus described events surrounding her decision to get baptized .
Today , Christian parents have a similar interest in helping their children make wise decisions .
Postponing baptism or delaying it needlessly could invite spiritual problems .
Wisely , however , parents want to be sure that before their children get baptized , they are ready to shoulder the responsibility of Christian discipleship .
In most cases , these young ones attend congregation meetings and share in the ministry .
What could be the reason for this ?
However , parents can benefit from reflecting on what it means to make a disciple .
However , the Bible shows that even relatively young children can grasp and appreciate Bible truths .
5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bible’s description of Timothy leads us to what conclusion about his baptism ?
( b ) How can discerning parents effectively assist their children ?
By the time he was in his late teens or early 20 ’ s , Timothy was a Christian disciple who could be considered for special privileges in the congregation . ​ — Acts 16 : 1 - 3 .
During the night , an earthquake shook the foundations of the jail and opened all the doors .
No doubt he continued to add to his knowledge after his baptism .
Some parents have concluded that it would be best for their son or daughter to delay baptism in order first to obtain some advanced education and become secure in a career .
More important , is it in harmony with the Scriptures ?
Would loving Christian parents really want this world to shape their child’s view of success ?
The fact is , we find true joy and success only when we give Jehovah first place in our lives . ​ — Read Psalm 1 : 2 , 3 .
They may conclude , ‘ As long as my child is not baptized , he cannot be disfellowshipped . ’
However , it would be a mistake to conclude that by not being baptized , a child is not accountable to Jehovah .
( Read James 4 : 17 . )
Such appreciation is the best protection , for your child will be motivated to hold to Jehovah’s righteous way . ​ — Isa .
How can the elders reinforce the efforts of parents who are helping their children progress to baptism ?
As spiritual shepherds , congregation elders can reinforce parents ’ efforts by speaking positively about spiritual goals .
What about making it a point ​ — before or after a meeting — ​ to talk with a young person , manifesting your genuine interest ?
( b ) What joy do all Christian parents strive for ?
( See opening picture . )
Moreover , love for God and for truth is not inherited .
What could be more important ?
Parents should have the goal of helping their child become a disciple ( See paragraphs 16 , 17 )
“ Baptism . . . is also now saving you . ” ​ — 1 PET .
3 : 21 .
Acts 22 : 16
Even so , earlier her mother had some lingering questions .
Noah faithfully fulfilled the work assignment that Jehovah had given him .
What is the point of Peter’s illustration ?
Like Noah , dedicated disciples obediently carry on in the work that God has assigned them to do .
What will we consider in this article ?
In view of how serious baptism is , three questions deserve our attention .
6 , 7 . ( a ) Explain the significance of John’s baptism . ( b ) What unique baptism did John perform ?
We first read of baptism in the Bible in reference to that performed by John the Baptist .
His baptism symbolized the presenting of himself to do God’s will . ​ — Heb .
However , after Jesus ’ death and resurrection , baptism would take on a much different meaning for his followers .
Yes , it seems that hundreds of his followers were present when Jesus gave the commission to make disciples .
Jesus thus revealed that baptism would be a requirement for those who accept the yoke of Christian discipleship .
This would be the only water baptism having God’s approval .
9 , 10 .
What can we learn about baptism from the Ethiopian proselyte and from the apostle Paul ?
What was the Ethiopian’s response ?
He desired to work in harmony with Jehovah’s arrangement , so he got baptized without delay .
That man was zealous for the traditions of Judaism , but he learned a better way .
He received a personal witness from the resurrected and glorified Jesus Christ .
Regarding that man the Bible tells us : “ He then got up and was baptized . ”
Those who have faith and genuine appreciation for Bible truth are eager to make a personal dedication and get baptized .
What steps led up to their baptism ?
Before a student can get baptized , he must cultivate faith based on accurate knowledge of God , His purpose , and His arrangement for salvation .
Such faith moves the student to reject conduct that is displeasing to God and to come in line with Jehovah’s righteous standards .
But more is needed than adhering to Jehovah’s elevated moral standards .
Only after taking such steps can a new disciple make a valid dedication to Jehovah in private prayer and then publicly symbolize this dedication by getting baptized before onlookers .
Do you bear in mind the importance of baptism , conveying that to your student ?
Yes , we want our children and other Bible students to progress to the point of baptism !
15 , 16 . ( a ) Is there a certain age at which one should get baptized ?
The student and her teacher reviewed pertinent scriptures from the Bible .
The student now understood the Bible’s requirement and got baptized soon thereafter .
Yes , valid baptism is based on an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s will .
It is also a time for sober reflection . Living up to one’s dedication involves hard work .
Jesus ’ disciples must “ live no longer for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised up . ” ​ — 2 Cor .
16 : 24 .
Thus , Bible students who wish to observe all the things that Jesus commanded must disown themselves , dedicating themselves unreservedly to Jehovah .
SONGS : 100 , 87
the need for hospitality within the congregation ?
And they lived at a critical time .
Yes , the violent end of the Jewish system of things would come in less than a decade .
Note , however , that Peter urged his Christian brothers and sisters to be hospitable “ to one another , ” to those whom they already knew and associated with .
It would draw them together .
What opportunities do we have for extending hospitality “ to one another ” ?
How can we overcome barriers that may hinder us from being hospitable ?
How can we be hospitable at our Christian meetings ?
He might appreciate help to follow the program and perhaps to find scriptures being read .
12 : 13 .
When hard times come , will we not depend on one another ?
Visits of public speakers from other congregations , as well as visits of circuit overseers and , at times , representatives from the local branch office , provide opportunities for us to extend hospitality .
Long - term guests : In ancient times , hospitality often included providing lodging for trustworthy visitors .
Students at theocratic schools may need places to stay , as may construction volunteers .
We should not assume that only those who have very comfortable homes are in a position to help ; they may already have done so many times .
As newlyweds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
What experience shows that hospitality need not be elaborate ?
Hospitality need not be elaborate .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
Then we made tea and hot chocolate .
We didn’t know Swahili yet , and she didn’t know English .
The Scriptures urge Christians to extend hospitality .
It is not wrong to make time for this ; actually , it is the right thing to do .
Your feelings about yourself : Have you ever wanted to be hospitable but felt inadequate ?
Some are shy and fear that conversation would lag or that guests might not feel entertained .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
One way is by following the encouragement given at Philippians 2 : 3 : “ With humility consider others superior to you . ”
Finding ways that our brothers or sisters are superior to us ​ — be it their faith , endurance , fearlessness , or some other Christian quality — ​ will deepen our love for them and open the way for genuine and healing hospitality .
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )
Our host may well have made preparations , and all his effort may be for nothing if we cancel .
Rather , we should accept hospitality with genuine appreciation for whatever our hosts have to offer .
It is also important to respect local customs .
I was among four little girls chosen to present Adolf Hitler with flowers after he gave a speech one time .
Why was I picked ?
Despite these two strong influences , I became neither a Nazi nor a nun .
So my mother allowed me to leave the school within a year .
3 : 5 , 6 .
She progressed to baptism , and later , so did her husband and two sons .
Well , no one had ever had a formal Bible study with me . I had to prepare well for each lesson .
While in London , I met Albert Schroeder .
Still , applying the Bible’s advice , we worked out our differences and enjoyed success as pioneer partners .
There was even some persecution , but we were “ not abandoned . ”
One day our landlord came home drunk , threatening to kill us and claiming that we were disturbing the neighborhood .
As it turned out , we stayed there for almost a year , which ultimately benefited our ministry .
Then I was reassigned to Feldbach , southeast of Graz .
I had a new pioneer partner , but again there was no congregation .
We also had to collect water from a well . But it was worth it . Within a few months , a group was established .
Eventually , some 30 members of a family with whom we studied came into the truth !
After obtaining that , I arrived in Paraguay in March 1959 .
In time , we were assigned to an area close to the Brazil border .
Instead , we drew closer to him , trusting him to resolve matters in his own time and in his own way . And he does ! ​ — 2 Tim .
I do miss Walter very much , but pioneering helps me to cope .
I find it especially beneficial to teach others , even sharing the resurrection hope with them .
Indeed , in more ways than I can recount , Jehovah has never failed me .
True to his promise , he has sustained me , fortified me , and taken hold of me with his “ right hand of righteousness . ” ​ — Isa .

Frankly , no man today can be certain of Paul’s appearance .
For example , Zion’s Watch Tower of March 1 , 1902 , mentioned one , saying : “ As to Paul’s personal appearance : . . .
D . 150 , there is a description of Paul which is probably the best , and a true tradition .
Thus , our artistic presentations are in line with some ancient indications of what the apostle looked like .
Bear in mind , though , that other things are more significant than Paul’s appearance .
But we should not forget that he became a Christian by a miraculous display from Jesus .
When giving discipline , how can we imitate Jehovah and his Son ?
We can view discipline as preparing us for what ?
WHEN you hear the word “ discipline , ” what comes to mind ?
Perhaps you immediately think of punishment , but much more is involved .
That is because God’s discipline is an expression of his love for us and of his desire that we gain everlasting life .
( See opening picture . )
His mother says : “ Johnny , you know that you should not play with your ball in the house ! You might break something . ”
Then reinforcing her words , she may administer some form of appropriate punishment .
For example , she might take the ball away from Johnny for a period of time .
God cares deeply for us and wants to spare us heartache . ​ — 1 Pet .

( a ) Jehovah blesses what kind of training ?
By giving Scriptural discipline , we can help our child or a Bible student to reach the goal of becoming a follower of Christ .
( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
( 3 ) When we give discipline , how can we imitate Jehovah and his Son ?
( b ) How are you encouraged by Jehovah’s treatment of Shebna ?
If you have privileges in the congregation , perhaps with a measure of prominence , will you strive to maintain a humble view of yourself ?
12 : 3 .
Remember , our Father will not consider us beyond hope if we humble ourselves before him .
Third , Jehovah’s treatment of Shebna provides a valuable lesson for those who are authorized to administer discipline , such as parents and Christian overseers .
While Jehovah’s discipline can reflect his hatred of sin , it can also show his concern for the person who sinned .
Sadly , after receiving discipline , some fail to see past the pain and even draw away from God and his people .
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
But only now can I honestly say that I love Jehovah . ’
Jesus always listened obediently to his Father , even when doing so was very difficult .
Jesus ’ humility and obedience drew people of honest heart to him and helped to make him a compassionate and gracious teacher .
( a ) What does Jehovah require of parents ?
( b ) How does God help parents fulfill their responsibilities ?

Yes , Jehovah holds Christian parents accountable if they fail to provide needed discipline to a child !
It would be difficult to enumerate all the blessings that result from accepting divine discipline and from imitating Jehovah and Jesus when disciplining others .
Individuals also feel truly loved , valued , and secure ​ — a foretaste of the blessings to come .
In what ways does Jehovah patiently teach us self - discipline ?
How can we benefit fully from any Scriptural discipline we may receive in the Christian congregation ?
Says James 1 : 5 : “ If any one of you is lacking in wisdom , let him keep asking God , for he gives generously to all and without reproaching . ”
Yes , let us never forget that Jehovah has our best interests at heart .
Let us now examine four aspects of discipline : ( 1 ) self - discipline , ( 2 ) parental discipline , ( 3 ) discipline within the Christian congregation , and ( 4 ) something that is worse than the temporary pain of discipline .
Illustrate .
Likewise , when parents consistently and patiently train their little ones “ in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah , ” they are also helping their children to develop self - discipline and wisdom . ​ — Eph .
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is self - discipline an important part of “ the new personality ” ?
True , they may already have developed a measure of self - discipline .
What will help him to succeed ?
The fruitage of that spirit includes self - control , which is closely related to self - discipline .
4 : 15 .
How can self - discipline help us to reach a spiritual goal ?
He also arranged to be an auxiliary pioneer when he could .
8 - 10 .
Illustrate .
When parents listen to God , successful child - rearing does not become a matter of guesswork ; nor does it depend on human experience or human thinking .
Noah also succeeded as a family man ​ — and for basically the same reason ; he trusted in God’s wisdom .
As parents , how can you do “ just so ” in God’s eyes ?
One brother wrote : “ I am filled with gratitude for the way my parents raised me .
Nonetheless , parents who have tried their best to impress the truth on a child’s heart have a good conscience . They can also hope that the wayward child will one day come “ home ” to Jehovah .
( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedience to Jehovah ?
One of the greatest tests of obedience that some parents have involves their relationship with a disfellowshipped child .
“ Now she calls or texts me nearly every day ! ”
Ask yourself , ‘ How often has a talk or an article in one of our journals moved me to make adjustments in my thinking or conduct ? ’
If you have responded positively , rejoice ! You are allowing Jehovah to mold , or discipline , you for your benefit . ​ — Prov .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
Another way is to heed their Scriptural counsel .
Remember , the elders love us and want us to grow spiritually .
For instance , if they notice that we are missing meetings or that our zeal is cooling off , they will no doubt quickly come to our aid .
Similarly , the apostle Paul no doubt had to muster up courage to provide correction when Peter , one of the 12 apostles , showed favoritism toward his Jewish brothers .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
In the world , discipline , including self - discipline , is often sneered at .
Safeguard it , for it means your life . ”
People around the world are demanding more freedom .
20 Encourage One Another “ All the More So ”
“ If the Son sets you free , you will be truly free . ” ​ — JOHN 8 : 36 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What evidence is there that people are struggling to gain freedom ?
On the contrary , they often lead to tragedies and loss of life .
He wrote : “ The one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it . . . will be happy in what he does . ”
He gave the first human couple everything that they needed to be happy ​ — including true freedom .
( See opening picture . )
When reading the first two chapters of Genesis , we can easily see that Adam and Eve enjoyed the kind of freedom that people today can only hope for ​ — freedom from want , from fear , and from oppression .
Many today think that to be truly free , they must be able to do anything and everything they want to do , regardless of the consequences .
The World Book Encyclopedia defines freedom as “ the ability to make choices and to carry them out . ”
Would they feel a loss of freedom for having to do these things ?
Why ?
Why was God’s command found at Genesis 2 : 17 not unjust , unnecessary , or unreasonable ?
Certainly not .
Upon reading Jehovah’s command to Adam , many today would say that Adam was denied the freedom to do what he wanted .
That is why we so often see people make choices or decisions with all good intentions ​ — only to have them result in suffering , disaster , or tragedy .
Human limitations play a large role .
How is that so , and did that first couple respond ?
This can be illustrated with a pilot flying an airplane . To reach a certain destination safely , he usually must follow a preapproved flight path .
Modern aviation equipment allows a pilot to use onboard navigation instruments and to keep in touch with air traffic controllers along the way so as to reach his planned destination .
Like that pilot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
People may think that the more freedom they have , the better off they will be , but the reality is that having unbounded freedom is a two - edged sword .
For this reason , The World Book Encyclopedia states : “ The laws of every organized society form a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms and restrictions . ”
Just think of the volumes and volumes of laws written by man , let alone the armies of lawyers and judges needed to interpret and administer them .
Jesus ’ direction for gaining true freedom involves two requirements : First , accept the truth that he taught , and second , become his disciple .
But freedom from what ?
In that sense we are slaves of sin , and the outcome is frustration , pain , suffering , and finally death .
How can we become truly free ?
( b ) What will we consider in the next article ?
Submitting to Jesus ’ teachings as his disciples will give our life real meaning and satisfaction .
( Read Romans 8 : 1 , 2 , 20 , 21 . )
In what ways has Jehovah’s spirit liberated us ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why were people in the apostle Paul’s day concerned with slavery and freedom ?
PEOPLE of the Roman world , among whom the early Christians lived , prided themselves on being champions of law , justice , and freedom .
Yet , much of the power and glory of the Roman Empire was built on the backs of slaves .
At one point , some 30 percent of the population were slaves .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What led up to Paul’s statement found at 2 Corinthians 3 : 17 ?
Upon seeing Moses , the people became fearful , and Moses put a veil over his face .
The Israelites in the wilderness did not view Jehovah’s dealings with them in a spiritual way .
It was as if their hearts and minds were veiled and hardened , focused only on using their newfound freedom from Egypt in a physical , or fleshly , way . ​ — Heb .
Far beyond what human efforts can hope to achieve , the spirit of Jehovah brings liberation from enslavement to sin and death , as well as from slavery to false worship and its practices .
What a glorious freedom that is !
( Look under INTERVIEWS AND EXPERIENCES > ENDURING TRIALS . )
Within a few months of their deliverance , they began to long for the food and drink they once had in Egypt and complained about Jehovah’s provisions , even wanting to return to Egypt .
Is it any wonder that Jehovah became very angry with his people ?
What a lesson for us !

How did Paul act in harmony with his counsel found at 2 Corinthians 6 : 1 , and how can we do likewise ?
Recall the misery and pain of conscience that Paul suffered because of feeling captive to sin and death .
Following Paul’s example , we too should never take for granted that Jehovah liberated us from the bondage of sin and of death .
Satan and his world offer ever more alluring choices in dress and grooming , food and drink , recreation and entertainment , and a host of other things .
How easy it is to fall prey to these ploys and to misuse our freedom !
What should they and their parents bear in mind ?
Some individuals may feel that since choices in these matters are personal , they should have the freedom to choose what they please as long as their conscience permits it .
Perhaps they have in mind Paul’s words to the Corinthian Christians about food : “ Why should my freedom be judged by another person’s conscience ? ”
While it is true that we have the freedom to make personal choices regarding our education and career , we need to remember that our freedom is relative and that all decisions we make have consequences .
He urged us to use our freedom “ as slaves of God . ”
Thus , the real purpose for which Jehovah , through Jesus , has freed us from the law of sin and of death is for us to live a life of dedication “ as slaves of God . ”
The best way to protect ourselves from misusing our freedom and thus becoming enslaved again by worldly ambitions and desires is to be fully absorbed in spiritual pursuits .
Yet , they kept free from being entangled in the desires and pursuits of the people around them .
“ Noah did according to all that God had commanded him .

He did just so . ”
( Read Luke 4 : 18 , 19 . )
That is not an easy work , and there are many challenges .
In some lands , people are becoming more indifferent , some even hostile .
Some of them serve within their local territories ; others move to where the need is greater .
Records show that in the last five years , the average number of regular pioneers has grown to over 1,100,000 and more than a quarter of a million worldwide have been added to the ranks of full - time preachers .
110 : 3 .
“ Jehovah became more real to me , as a loving father would be .
How have thousands with limited circumstances used their freedom wisely ?
What glorious future awaits those who now use their God - given freedom wisely ?
We are grateful that we have come to know Jehovah and can enjoy the freedom that true worship brings .
If you are one of those dear brothers , then surely you rejoice in your new privilege of service .
He put spiritual interests first .
When opportunities arose to advance the good news , his attitude was like that of Isaiah , who said : “ Here I am ! Send me ! ” ​ — Isa .
“ Make sure of the more important things , ” urged Paul .
Eliminate time and energy stealers .
2 : 22 .
Because Timothy applied what he learned , he qualified for greater responsibility . ​ — 1 Cor .
He kept training himself .
An athlete may have a coach , but he also needs to train himself .
4 : 13 - 15 .

Now I really enjoy my assignment and view it as a wonderful privilege ! ”
Will you keep making spiritual progress ? Make it your aim to learn from Timothy .
Then you too will be a blessing to God’s people .

How has Jehovah proved to be a God who gives encouragement ?
How did the apostles encourage their brothers ?
EVER since humankind fell into sin and imperfection , Jehovah has proved that he is a God who gives encouragement .
Once understood , the prophetic promise written at Genesis 3 : 15 would give humankind hope that eventually “ the original serpent , ” Satan the Devil , and all his evil works would be destroyed . ​ — Rev .
Jehovah told Noah that He was going to put an end to that wicked world and instructed him about what he must do to ensure his family’s safety .
Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ”
( b ) How did Jehovah encourage his Son ?
Do not be anxious , for I am your God . I will fortify you , yes , I will help you , I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness . ”
How those words must have strengthened Jesus throughout his earthly ministry !
Jesus imitated his Father’s example .
What does the book of Job teach us about giving encouragement ?
Another example in ancient times of someone in need of encouragement is Jephthah’s daughter .
But he kept his vow and sent his virgin daughter to Shiloh to serve at the tabernacle for the rest of her life . ​ — Judg .
However hard this was on Jephthah , it may have been harder still on his daughter , who willingly complied with her father’s decision .
His riveting Gospel account of Jesus ’ ministry has been a source of encouragement to Christians throughout the centuries ​ — and still is .
When Philip the evangelizer preached about Christ to the Samaritans , he received the full backing of those on the governing body .
What effect did the letter sent by the governing body have on the early Christian congregation ?

Today , the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses gives encouragement to Bethel family members , to special full - time field workers , and indeed , to the entire international brotherhood of true Christians .
The answer to that question will be found in the following article .
WHY should we intensify our efforts to be encouraging ?
He told them : “ Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works , not forsaking our meeting together , as some have the custom , but encouraging one another , and all the more so as you see the day drawing near . ”
Within just five years , Jewish Christians living in Jerusalem would see a “ day of Jehovah ” approaching and recognize the sign Jesus had given them to flee for their lives from that city .
That day of Jehovah arrived in 70 C.E . when the Romans executed Jehovah’s judgment on Jerusalem .
The prophet Zephaniah said : “ The great day of Jehovah is near !
In view of the proximity of Jehovah’s day , Paul tells us to “ be concerned about one another so as to incite to love and fine works . ”
We all need a word of encouragement from time to time .
The same is true of missionaries , Bethelites , circuit overseers and their wives , and those who work in remote translation offices .
Brothers and sisters who remain single because they want to obey the admonition to marry “ only in the Lord ” make up another group that merits encouragement .
What is the role of the elders as described at Isaiah 32 : 1 , 2 ?
Read Isaiah 32 : 1 , 2 .
1 : 24 .
Showing that just a word of encouragement does not always suffice , Paul told the elders from Ephesus : “ You must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus , when he himself said : ‘ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ’ ”
Building one another up may involve giving counsel , but here again , elders should follow the example given in the Bible about how to give counsel in an encouraging way .
Elders would do well to imitate Christ’s example when they need to give counsel .
Parents , are you training your children to encourage others ? ( See paragraph 10 )
How can all of us share in building one another up ?
Being encouraging is not the exclusive responsibility of the elders .
Paul exhorted all Christians to speak “ what is good for building up as the need may be , to impart what is beneficial ” to others .
Each of us should be alert to observe “ the need ” that others have .

Paul gave this advice to all the members of the congregation in Philippi : “ If , then , there is any encouragement in Christ , if any consolation of love , if any spiritual fellowship , if any tender affection and compassion , make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love , being completely united , having the one thought in mind .
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism , but with humility consider others superior to you , as you look out not only for your own interests , but also for the interests of others . ” ​ — Phil .
What does it take to encourage someone ?
He found great comfort in reading Psalm 46 ; Zephaniah 3 : 17 ; and Mark 10 : 29 , 30 .
3 : 16 ; Acts 16 : 25 .
Why will mutual encouragement become more and more important in the days ahead , and what should we do ?
5 : 11 .
At the bus station , you are overwhelmed by crowds of passengers and many buses .
Youths , you can make it easier for yourselves if you have a good idea where you want to go in life .
Where should you be headed ?
And it means reaching out for spiritual goals .
Setting theocratic goals early in life makes good sense .
What is the primary reason for setting spiritual goals ?
The primary reason for setting spiritual goals is to show Jehovah how grateful we are for his love and for what he has done for us .
As a young person , think of all you owe to Jehovah .
This brings you even closer to him .
Making decisions is like choosing the right road when you come to an intersection .
That is what Damaris experienced when she faced an important decision as a teenager .
My decision to pioneer helped me sidestep frustration in a secular career and opened the way for years of joy in Jehovah’s service . ”
Thousands of young ones in congregations all over the world deserve warm praise .
Jesus Christ stressed that “ the good news has to be preached first . ”
How do you prepare to give a witness ?
( See paragraphs 11 , 12 )
Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > TEENAGERS .
As you have opportunity , encourage your schoolmates to look up jw.org for themselves .
Katharina was 17 years old when she made it her goal to witness to each colleague at work .
Katharina had moved away and did not know all of this .
Relate an experience showing the benefits of humility .
Keep yourself focused on theocratic goals , including Jehovah in all your plans .
Over 30 years later , Mirjana is still in full - time service , together with her husband .
Youths do this by reaching out for spiritual goals and by giving the preaching work high priority .
Adolescents can be sure that their hard work is not in vain .
“ Who ” was the meaning given in the earlier rendering .
The revised wording fits in well with the rest of the psalm .
Indeed , during the reign of David’s son Solomon , the nation enjoyed unprecedented peace and prosperity .
What is more , aspects of Solomon’s reign point forward to the rule of the Messiah . ​ — 1 Ki .
Why ?
It had been 28 years since Jesus gave his followers that warning .
( Read Hebrews 10 : 36 - 39 . )
Why should we be interested in the book of Hebrews ?
Why ?
So , like the Christians in Paul’s time , we need to be alert .
Another reason is that we need one another , especially during difficult times .
When Paul wrote his letter to the Hebrew Christians , he knew that soon some would have to leave their homes and personal things .
What do we need to do now before the start of the great tribulation ?
The greatest tribulation in mankind’s history is coming soon .
We will need to obey the counsel : “ Go , my people , enter your inner rooms , and shut your doors behind you . Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by . ”
But we must do more than just meet together regularly .
Our goal is to encourage our brothers , not to impress them with what we have .
When Paul wrote this , he was referring to the brothers who were in prison for their faith .
Paul commended the congregation because they had shown “ sympathy for those in prison . ”

We can pray for the brothers , sisters , and even children who are in prison in Eritrea
Brotherly love will motivate us to pray intensely for them .
We can also show brotherly love by being morally clean .
How does contentment help us to show brotherly love ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
Trust in Jehovah will help us to be content , that is , to be satisfied with what we have .
How does this help us to show brotherly love ?
We will not complain about our brothers or about our situation in life .
“ Be of good courage . ”
Trust in Jehovah gives us the courage to endure difficult trials .
This courage helps us to have a positive attitude .
Instead , we want to obey willingly .
This way we “ give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 13 .
Do you appreciate the work that elders do for us ?
Jehovah’s people are known for their brotherly love .
He said : “ Go on doing so in fuller measure . ”
Do I honor God’s arrangement of marriage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What does God’s “ indescribable free gift ” include ?
Why did Paul use that expression ?
Paul knew that Jesus ’ sacrifice is a guarantee that all of God’s wonderful promises will come true .
Such a valuable gift is impossible to describe in a way that we can completely understand .
For the rest of your life , you would want to show that you are grateful for the sacrifice that was made .
God’s gift of the ransom is much greater than the gift in the example .
( b ) Name three things God’s gift will motivate us to do .
It will motivate us ( 1 ) to imitate Christ Jesus closely , ( 2 ) to love our brothers , and ( 3 ) to forgive others from the heart .
How do we do that ?
How can we resist that pressure ?
What questions can we ask ourselves during this Memorial season , and what may the answers motivate us to do ?
‘ Would my clothes show that I am a follower of Christ ?
Would Jesus like to watch my movies ?
As a result , the brother reached his goal of 30 hours .
So if we accept God’s love , we need to love our brothers .
What example did Jesus set in loving others ?
The Memorial season is also a good time to think about how you can help the brothers and sisters in your congregation , especially the older ones .
( Read Luke 14 : 12 - 14 . )
Third , Jehovah’s love motivates us to forgive our brothers and sisters .
Each of us has been forgiven a huge debt !
The king was furious when he heard that his slave did not forgive such a small debt .
Do I find it difficult to forgive him ? ’
One sister who did that was Lily .
( See endnote . )
May we always appreciate it !
Romans 8 : 15 , 16 ; 1 John 2 : 20 , 27
( See opening picture . ) IT WAS Sunday morning in Jerusalem .
Then , at about nine o’clock , he offered two leavened loaves made from the first wheat , or the firstfruits , of the harvest .
Eight hundred years earlier , the prophet Joel had written about this event .
Then , he told the crowd : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
How do we know that not all those who are anointed receive their anointing in exactly the same way ?
They had no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit .
For example , the Bible does not say that something that looked like a flame appeared on the heads of the thousands in Jerusalem who were anointed later that day .
In this way , the holy spirit is “ a token in advance , ” or proof to them that in the future they will live forever in heaven and not on earth . ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 21 , 22 ; 5 : 5 .
Each anointed Christian must not let anything stop him from serving Jehovah
He is sure that he has been invited to go to heaven .
Even though he has been invited , or called , to go to heaven , if he does not stay faithful , he will not get his reward . ​ — Hebrews 3 : 1 ; Revelation 2 : 10 .
8 , 9 . ( a ) Why is it difficult for most people to understand what happens when someone is anointed ?
The apostle John tells anointed Christians : “ You have an anointing from the holy one , and all of you have knowledge . ”
11 , 12 .
He then explained : “ Do not be amazed because I told you : You people must be born again .
The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit . ”
They looked forward to the time when Jehovah would make the earth into a paradise and remove all wickedness .
These Christians do not want to die .
They enjoy life and want to use each day to serve Jehovah with their family and friends .
Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful results in the preaching work ?
Do you want to do what Jehovah wants more than anything else ?
No , it does not .
And by means of his holy spirit , Jehovah can give the same power to any of his servants , no matter what their reward will be .
Even so , the apostle Peter said that David “ did not ascend to the heavens . ”
So most of the 144,000 have already died and are in heaven .
If someone in your congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should you treat him ?
We will answer these questions in the next article .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 4 ) The Festival of Pentecost was possibly celebrated at the same time of the year that the Law was given to Moses at Sinai .
By means of his spirit , he gives that person a promise for the future , or “ a token in advance . ”
How should anointed Christians feel about themselves ? ​ — 1 Corinthians 4 : 6 - 8 .
The “ Jew ” represents those whom God has anointed by holy spirit .
They know that Jehovah has blessed this group of anointed ones and feel that it is an honor to worship him with them .
( 3 ) If someone in my congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should I treat him ?
If it is not possible to know the names of all anointed ones on earth today , how can we “ go with ” them ?
This means that the Jew is not just one person but represents the whole group of anointed ones .
They do not need to know the names of every member of that group and follow each one of them .
( Read . )
How should anointed Christians feel about themselves ?
Paul explained : “ With all humility and mildness , with patience , putting up with one another in love , earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace . ”
Jehovah’s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble , not proud .
And they do not feel that they can understand Bible truths more deeply than anyone else .
Although anointed ones feel that it is an honor to be invited to go to heaven , they do not expect others to treat them in a special way .


The congregation would not be united if anointed ones did this .

Jesus told his disciples : “ All of you are brothers . ”
None of us want to do anything that might cause one of Christ’s anointed brothers to make such a serious mistake ! ​ — Luke 17 : 2 .
We would not ask them how they became anointed .
How do we protect ourselves if we avoid “ admiring personalities ” ?
How ?
Also , some anointed ones might not stay faithful .
But if we avoid “ admiring personalities , ” we will never follow others , even those who are anointed or well - known or those who have served Jehovah for a long time .
For many years , the number of those who ate the bread and drank the wine at the Memorial kept going down .
But recently , that number has been going up every year .
Do we need to worry about this ?
“ Jehovah knows those who belong to him . ”
Others may have mental or emotional problems and believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven .
What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones who will be on earth when the great tribulation starts ?
There will be anointed ones in many parts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven .
15 , 16 .
What do we need to understand about the 144,000 chosen by Jehovah ?
( See endnote . )
Not all who have the hope of living in heaven are part of “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
Just as in the first century , Jehovah and Jesus today are using a few people to feed , or teach , many .
And today , only a few anointed Christians have the responsibility to give God’s people “ food at the proper time . ”
Jehovah rewards all of his servants , the “ Jew ” and the “ ten men , ” and he requires them to obey the same laws and stay faithful .
They may be circuit overseers , Bethelites , members of the Branch Committee , members of the Governing Body , or helpers to the Governing Body .
We do not want to be like Diotrephes , who did not welcome the brothers visiting his congregation because he did not respect them .
But even if we welcome these brothers , could it be that we are still not showing them respect ?
How might this happen ?
Would we ask them to sign our books and Bibles ?
Surely , if we love our brothers and sisters , we would not do anything like this .
First , remember that we should give glory to Jehovah .
They want to be treated as our brothers and sisters .
Instead , the other sheep love and respect anointed ones and treat them as their brothers and sisters
is a protection for us ?
JEHOVAH is the Supreme One .
Jehovah can do whatever he decides to do without help from anyone .
God created his Son , Jesus , before he created everyone and everything else .
What did Jehovah invite Adam to do , and why ?
For example , he allowed Adam to name the animals .
God also gave Adam the assignment to make the entire earth into a paradise .
Mary became mother to Jesus .
All these faithful ones and many others worked with Jehovah to accomplish his will .
Jehovah could have done this work by himself .
Before coming to earth , God’s firstborn Son said : “ Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way . . .
I was beside him as a master worker . I was the one he was especially fond of day by day ; I rejoiced before him all the time . ”
But what about us ?
Why does the preaching work bring us joy ?
It makes it possible for those who become God’s friends to have everlasting life . ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 20 .
When we help others learn about God , we know that we are pleasing Jehovah and that he values our efforts to serve him .
Their love and affection for each other became so strong that nothing could destroy their relationship .
We will welcome back those who are resurrected and teach them about Jehovah .
Preaching strengthens our faith because it reminds us of God’s promises and loving standards .
It also helps us to maintain the qualities we need in order to protect ourselves from Satan and his world . ​ — Read Ephesians 6 : 14 - 17 .
When we keep busy in Jehovah’s work , we do not have time to worry too much about our own problems
Yet , many of us continue in the preaching work year after year , even though this costs us time and money and even though people make fun of us or get angry with us .
How do you feel about the honor to preach the good news ?
20 Learn From Jehovah’s Loyal Servants
26 Life Story ​ — Jehovah Has Given Me Success in His Service
I asked him , “ Are you going to make me go through that again ? ”
I WAS born in 1926 in Crooksville , Ohio , in the United States .
I went to the Methodist Church .
Mother thought that I would interfere with her study , so she told me to get out of the house .
But I kept trying to listen to their discussions .
I ran out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home tonight , look up Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible and see what God’s name is . ”
You might say I started witnessing right away .
I studied the Bible and got baptized in 1941 .
I encouraged my mother and siblings to come , and they all began attending the book study that I conducted .
Dad , though , was not interested .
One day , Dad pointed to my books and said : “ You see all that stuff ?
I want it out of this house , and you can go with it . ”
I left home and went to live in nearby Zanesville , Ohio , but I traveled back and forth to encourage my family .
Does that make sense ? ”
They helped me and others to remain close to Jehovah .
They assigned us a weekly Bible reading , and we prepared questions and answers for meetings that we called Bible Bees .
Anyone assigned to that bed is your territory .
World War II ended in 1945 , but I stayed in prison for some time after that .
Going out in the ministry with Demetrius Papageorge , an anointed brother who began serving Jehovah in 1913
I quoted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a soldier of Christ . ”
Soon afterward , I attended the Bethel meeting at a convention in Cincinnati , Ohio .
Brother Milton Henschel told us that there was a need at Bethel for brothers who wanted to work hard for the Kingdom .
But all of Jehovah’s servants are imperfect , including Bethelites .
I think of Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 and how we should handle our disagreements .
I taught her the names of fruits and vegetables in English , and she repeated the words after me .
I also explained Bible texts to her , and she accepted the Bible Teach book .
Months later , I offered the magazines to another girl who was passing out advertisements , and she accepted them .
The voice at the other end said , “ Robby , this is Katie .
Robby , you know that girl who handed you the phone ? She’s my sister .
Please teach her the way you taught me . ”
Thanks for letting me know where you are . ”
Soon afterward , I spoke to Katie’s sister for the last time .
Wherever those two girls are now , I hope that they learn more about Jehovah .
Also , my siblings tell me that they were encouraged when I faced Dad’s opposition without giving up .
Even Dad’s attitude changed a little , and he attended some meetings before he passed away .
If it is God’s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .
How did knowledge and experience strengthen Abraham’s faith ?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his friendship with God ?
How can you imitate Abraham in building a friendship with Jehovah ?
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
But we know the truth !
( See endnote . )
Isaac carried firewood , and Abraham carried a knife and the things needed to start a fire .
Abraham did not blindly obey God , that is , obey him without thinking
He knew that Jehovah would never ask him to do anything that would cause permanent harm .
People there worshipped false gods , and his father did too .
The Bible shows that Noah’s son Shem was Abraham’s relative . And he lived until Abraham was about 150 years old .
6 , 7 .
How did Abraham gain experience that strengthened his faith in Jehovah ?
In order to have a close friendship with God , we need to have godly fear .
Can we be close friends with Jehovah ?
Today , we have much more than Abraham had .
This love and respect for God motivates us to obey him .
When we do , we see how he protects and blesses us , and this gives us experience that makes our faith stronger .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What is needed for a friendship to become stronger ?
A year before Isaac was born , when Abraham was 99 years old , Jehovah told him to circumcise all the males in his household .
Why was Abraham concerned about Sodom and Gomorrah , and how did Jehovah help him ?
Jehovah explained that even when he brings judgment , he searches for good people and saves them . ​ — Genesis 18 : 22 - 33 .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Abraham’s knowledge and experience help him later ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham had confidence in Jehovah ?
What did Abraham mean ?
( Read Hebrews 11 : 19 . )
What challenges do you face in serving Jehovah , and how may Abraham’s example help you ?
Today , however , Jehovah does not ask us to sacrifice our children , but he does ask us to obey his commands .
Do you ever feel like that ?
Maybe they are shy and find it hard to talk to people they do not know .
When we meditate on examples of faithful men and women , it can motivate us to imitate them and to draw closer to our Friend , Jehovah . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 , 2 .
Why ?
Because his friendship with Jehovah was always the most important thing to him .
And he will learn how the pain he felt when he prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac has helped millions of faithful people to understand Jehovah’s pain when he gave his Son , Jesus Christ , as a ransom for mankind .
( Read Hebrews 6 : 10 - 12 . )
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 3 ) Abraham and Sarah were originally called Abram and Sarai .
As we learn about him , we will begin to have deep love and respect for him .
Along the way , Orpah decided to go home to Moab .
But Naomi was determined to return to Israel , her homeland .
Would she go back home to Moab to be with her family , or would she stay with Naomi , her mother - in - law , and travel to Bethlehem ? ​ — Ruth 1 : 1 - 8 , 14 .
So Naomi told her to go back to Moab .
But Ruth decided not to return to her people and their false gods .
It seems that Ruth learned about Jehovah from her husband or from Naomi .
Our hearts are moved when we think about Ruth’s love for Naomi .
This also impressed Boaz , who later praised her for ‘ seeking refuge under Jehovah’s wings . ’
Ruth never had any reason to regret her decision .
Many people learn about Jehovah but choose not to take refuge in him .
If you feel the same way , think about why you hesitate .
And he will help you to keep serving him despite any problems you may have .
Hezekiah’s background was very different from Ruth’s .
But not all Israelites remained faithful .
Hezekiah’s father , King Ahaz , was wicked .
Ahaz even had some of Hezekiah’s brothers burned alive as sacrifices to a false god .
Others feel that their bad family background may cause them to have a bad life or to repeat their parents ’ mistakes .
It is true that parents can teach their children to do good or bad .
He paid close attention to their counsel and correction .
This motivated him to fix many of the problems his father had caused .
Later , when the Assyrian king Sennacherib threatened to attack Jerusalem , Hezekiah showed great courage and faith .
At one point Hezekiah became proud , but when Jehovah corrected him , he humbled himself .
Instead , he showed that he was Jehovah’s friend .
The world today is cruel and unloving , and many children grow up without loving and caring parents .
But what may have been some of her fears ?
She was ready to do whatever was asked of her , just like a slave girl .
One example of this was at Jesus ’ birth when shepherds told Mary about a message from an angel .
Later , when Jesus was 12 years old , he said something that amazed Mary .
What can we learn about Mary from the way she spoke ?
What Mary spoke about .
Her longest speech is found at Luke 1 : 46 - 55 .
We can also imitate Mary’s faith when we carefully listen to Jehovah and meditate on what we have learned about him and his purposes .
If we do so , we can look forward to the reward of being Jehovah’s friends forever !
Very likely , you have experienced much joy in serving Jehovah since your baptism .
However , a number of publishers have lost some of the joy they once had .
The Kingdom message brings us a lot of joy .
Because Jehovah promises that the Kingdom will soon put an end to this wicked world and bring in God’s new world .
So may we remember Jesus ’ words : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
We cannot serve Jehovah with joy and at the same time try to get all that we can from this world .
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment for yourselves .
We serve our Life - Giver , the happy God .
We realize that we owe our lives to our Creator .
I strive to stay active in the preaching work , and I try to keep the Kingdom hope foremost in my mind so as not to lose my joy . ”
Jehovah has provided the ransom sacrifice , making it possible for us to have a joyful life .
Yes , our sins can be forgiven and we can have everlasting life when we show faith in God’s loving gift of the ransom . This is truly an excellent reason to be grateful !
Jesús simplified his life and served Jehovah joyfully for years
I did it just to make more money .
To abandon his former lifestyle , Jaime had to ask Jehovah to help him believe in Him .
“ Little by little , I discovered the existence of a loving Father and merciful God , ” Jaime says .
Had I not changed , I might have been killed , as some of my former boxing friends were .
Remember , we are doing God’s will and we are looking forward to everlasting life .
We can be confident that Jehovah will reward our endurance because he knows the work we do and the love we show for him and his name .
And I reside in security . ” ​ — Psalm 16 : 8 , 9 .
“ May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever . ” ​ — 1 SAMUEL 20 : 42 .
SONGS : 125 , 62
How can we be loyal to God when we feel that someone who has authority does not deserve our respect ?
What was more important to Jonathan than being loyal to David , and how do we know ?
We usually admire people who are loyal .
But we know that we must be loyal to God even in difficult times .
Why was it difficult for the people of Israel to be loyal to God while Saul was king ?
What shows that Jonathan stayed loyal to Jehovah ?
At that time , a large army of Philistines came with 30,000 chariots to attack Israel .
How are we being loyal to God when we respect those who have authority ?
One way we stay loyal to Jehovah is by treating our husband or wife with respect , even if he or she does not serve Jehovah ( See paragraph 9 )
( See endnote . )
When Saul said that he was going to kill David , Jonathan had a difficult decision to make .
While she was studying the Bible , she told her family about the things she was learning .
He continues : “ I could not please one without displeasing the other . ”
How did Saul treat Jonathan unfairly ?
We can also be loyal to Jehovah if a brother who is taking the lead treats us unfairly .
In our congregations today , the brothers taking the lead try to be fair to everyone .
In what situations must we be loyal to God and not be selfish ?
If we make a business agreement , we will do what we agreed to do because we are loyal to God ( See paragraph 16 )
“ What is Jehovah requiring of you ?
Only to exercise justice , to cherish loyalty , and to walk in modesty with your God ! ” ​ — MICAH 6 : 8 .
They were all asleep , so David and Abishai walked carefully past the soldiers and found Saul .
David understood what he needed to do to be loyal to Jehovah .
Why ?
In addition , Abishai was a military leader and could have used this authority to make himself king , but he never did .
David was loyal to Jehovah all his life .
What lesson do we learn from Abishai’s mistake ?
Anne told her mother that the only way she could be happy again was by returning to Jehovah . ​ — James 4 : 8 .
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God ?
Jonathan became David’s friend and stayed loyal to him .
Why was Absalom not loyal to God ?
When a person is not humble and wants to have more authority , it is hard for him to stay loyal to God .
Stop seeking such things . ”
Daniel , a brother in Mexico , had to decide to whom he would be loyal .
Daniel says : “ I continued writing to her even after I entered the pioneer service . ”
He was not being loyal to Jehovah , and he needed to be humble .
The prophet Nathan stayed loyal to Jehovah and was also loyal to David .
After David had taken a man’s wife and then killed him , Jehovah sent Nathan to counsel David .
So he told him a story of a rich man who stole the only lamb that a poor man had .
David realized that he had sinned against Jehovah . ​ — 2 Samuel 12 : 1 - 7 , 13 .
Tell him that he should ask the elders for help and that he should speak to them soon .
And at the same time , you are kind to your brother because the elders can help him to have a good relationship with Jehovah again .
When people wanted to make Absalom king , Hushai needed courage to stay loyal to David and to God .
Did he abandon David and support Absalom ?
David prayed that Jehovah would help Hushai , and that is what happened .
Why do we need courage to be loyal ?
We never want to be like Abner and Absalom , who were not loyal .
